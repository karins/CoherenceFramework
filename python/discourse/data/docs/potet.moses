Yet a crucial step for the Balkans
Since the world is focused on Iraq, North Korea and a possible crisis with Iran over nuclear weapons, Kosovo is somewhat unnoticed.
The public will soon have the opportunity to look again at its attention to this province when a decision regarding its fate.
The États-unis and their European friends have repeatedly stated their intention to take before the end of the year the difficult decision to separate Kosovo from Serbia.
This decision, crucial to the future of an unstable region, will test the resolve and Western unity.
The talks this year in Vienna, orchestrated by the United Nations, have shown that an agreement between Serbia and Kosovo on a "final status" will not happen.
Negotiations are continuing, but, as with much tact negotiator and former Finnish president, Martti Ahtisaari, the Security Council, they died in the facts.
No leader of Serbia will not accept the independence of Kosovo because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country.
Indeed, the Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, apostle of Serbian nationalism, has made every effort to undermine the interim government in Kosovo.
It is eager to hold a national referendum this month on a new constitution without parliamentary debate seriously or the usual training the public.
The main objective of this new constitution in the preamble, which maintains Kosovo in its status as an inalienable part of Serbia.
The Kosovo Albanians have said they will only accept no link with Serbia, so tiny that it is.
Throughout the 1990s, they are virtually out of Kosovo managed by the Serbs in creating parallel institutions.
The mass exodus forced to 1999 and NATO intervention that followed, putting an end the reign of Serbia and establishing a quasi-État under the auspices of the UN, has become intolerable any solution other than that of independence.
In a month or two, the contact group in the Balkans, is the États-unis, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, will consider the recommendations of Ahtisaari on the final status of Kosovo and will offer a solution to the Security Council, which must take the final decision.
In public, all members of the contact group tried to leave the question of the status of Kosovo, but privately the États-unis and some of his allies have said the two parties that they would propose the independence this year.
Some members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, see a dim view of or remain sceptical about a solution imposed, and few governments are for the division of another country, compelling person under any circumstances.
The choice of the Security Council to approve the independence depends largely on the possibility of preventing a Russian veto, which will require considerable diplomatic efforts.
The nature of the independence granted is also important.
The independent Kosovo should be able to live in safety and its minorities must be protected.
The north of Kosovo today largely under the control of Belgrade, should not be partitioned to fully does not name.
In order to reduce the blow to Serbia, the Security Council fails to grant independence so disturbed that the new État cannot really work.
If the Security Council fails to take a decision on a final status, it will create a critical situation: Kosovo will declare independence unilaterally and all nations must decide not to recognise the new État.
If that happens, it is highly likely that the Serbs in northern Kosovo will declare their independence.
At least, Serbia will greatly campaign against any recognition.
Indeed, the government in Serbia are already trying to convince the West to defer the decision until by mid 2007.
He claims that if Kosovo becomes independent, the ultra-nationalist Radical Party will be there again to power the next elections, and believes that hold elections this year will prompt the contact group to push its proposal to the Security Council.
Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of the Republika Srpska from Bosnia to threaten to hold their own referendum on the separation of Bosnia still fragile.
And they continue to grow, in vain, for the referral of Ahtisaari in order to extend the discussions in Vienna.
The timing for the organisation of the constitutional referendum appears to be part of this strategy dilatory.
Some hope that a postponement will stimulate the violence in Kosovo and pushes the West to reconsider the independence of Kosovo.
This tactic may be working.
Many EU countries are worried about the implications of the withdrawal from territory of a country, as well as the impact of the independence of Kosovo on Serbian Democracy.
Étant given the political instability of Serbia, they put in doubt the damage that would cause a delay in the short term, which would be mainly auto-infligé.
But delaying the decision would only allow Kostunica to find new ways to make even more difficult a decision by the Security Council.
The West should ignore the siren song of Belgrade.
Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable in the near future, and Serbian politicians will try to use this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo.
Similarly, ties between Serbia and Kosovo, whatever the circumstances, will be problematic.
But a failure to vote today to a final on the final status of Kosovo will have a worse situation in the Balkans, will hamper the progress of Serbia to the West and joining the EU, blames the Kosovo's ethnic minorities in a dangerous ambiguity and will jeopardise the États fragile as Bosnia and Macedonia.
The only realistic option for Kosovo is independence.
If Serbia wants to join the West, it must not abandon the opportunity to fall for his nationalist past.

Dawn News and dangerous for South Korea
The decision of North Korea to expel the inspectors in the UN atomic energy is one more reason to consider the election of Roh Moo Hyun to the presidency of South Korea two weeks earlier as a historic landslide.
The start of its mandate is not only with one of the more dangerous episodes of the Korean peninsula for decades, but his presidency will also be a witness to a test of relations between the US and South Korea to a level not seen in the past.
The victory of Roh on Lee Hoi Chang shows a generational change in the Korean policy, with a young people determined to win a freedom of movement in its relations with the United States.
In fact, different generation were the decisive factor in the race for the presidential election, replacing the feelings regional dominèrent every presidential race before it.
According to a report, more than 60% of the population of 20 or 30 years ago voted for Roh, creating a gap of 2.3% in this presidential race where bed for the first time in 31 years, two men face to face, shoulder to shoulder.
The populist and nationalist Roh will be quickly and severely tested by the reality when it will take his post in February.
But one that combines the generational change that brought to power with a strong popular will continue the commitments to North Korea, beyond the fact that North Korea continues to strengthen the nuclear power, and the recipe is complete in a disagreement with the United States.
Roh, a student who manages the examination of the bar without ever go to university or to his right, has managed to convince voters that he would open a new era in politics, reflecting better a South Korea enriched and whose middle class has strengthened, sweeping away the political games are dominated by insiders, the regional disputes and the struggles of the factions.
His style and its rhetoric pushed for the new (for Korea!) of a man of the people involved in the elimination of cronyism and corruption, made more callous.
For the first time in modern history of Korea, the presidential campaign has really been the place of debates on the central issues facing the country, rather than focusing on the parties and personalities.
The candidate Roh has called for new relations between South Korea and America, based on the principle of independence and equality.
Thus, he announced no longer want to be an extension of the US or to go to Washington to do just the photo. He also promised to continue the policy of President Kim Dae Jung, called "the politics of ray of sunshine," in its involvement with the North.
It is remarkable that Roh won the election despite the decision of North Korea reactivating its nuclear reactors arrested since 1994.
A few years earlier, it would have condemned the candidacy of Roh.
He has overcome the obstacle without a change of position on the engagement with North Korea shows that times have changed radically.
The popular pressing for change rather than a comfortable position now becomes the main concern of any North Korean way.
The election campaign Roh also benefited from a growing trend of anti-Americanism.
The acquittal by an American military tribunal of two American soldiers who killed accidentally in their armored vehicle two Korean schoolchildren in June last year set off the street demonstrations across the country.
Although President George W. Bush has apologized twice for the deaths of two girls, the continued to accumulate for amending the agreement on the status of the armed forces (status of force agreement, sofa), which governs the treatment legal reserved for American troops stationed in South Korea.
The Koreans insist that the American soldiers who commit crimes should be judged by the courts Koreans.
This expression of national pride injured was possible after the extraordinary performance of the South Korean team at the football World Cup last summer, which helped convince the Koreans to full maturity of their country, and so can now defend themselves without the presence of American soldiers.
In fact many Koreans who are now the American presence, and not the communist regime of North Korea, as the biggest obstacle to the unification.
According to a recent poll, only 54,8% of Koreans are still favour the maintenance of American troops in their country, while 31,7% oppose it.
These feelings will form part of the test of diplomacy, which will give its forms to the presidency of Roh since its inception, because it needs to rethink the relationship between Korea and the United States even as the Bush administration is concerned about North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its role in the spread of weapons of mass destruction in the rogue state.
For now, voters in Korea, apparently insensitive to threats presented by the nuclear weapons in North Korea, support the policy of Roh for keeping the dialogue and trade with the North.
Under the chairmanship of Roh, domestic policy in South Korea and its relations with the US and North Korea will require a total to nine.
He will stay on the verge of maintaining security in the peninsula remains committed to America and with the support of its electorate?
Reconciling these targets would be a test difficult even for the politician most experienced and the more cynical, then to know if President Roh can succeed is the divination.
Any failure, however, means the outlook so horrific that nobody can really wish him.

All his path to peace
Over the next three weeks, the Israeli army is an exercise unprecedented: Instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorists, it is going to evacuate, by force if necessary, 9,000 Israelis in their homes.
The unilateral withdrawal of Israel is the culmination of a deep political change caused by two convictions somewhat contradictory that characterised the policies of the Prime Minister Ariel Sharon since 2003: first, that the so-called road map initially launched by the États-unis is going nowhere, and then that the status quo is untenable.
For Ariel Sharon, there is no doubt that the 9,000 Jewish settlers who live among the 1.2 million Palestinians in Gaza have no future.
Therefore, lack of negotiations, a unilateral withdrawal is the only sensible approach to reducing violence and stabilisation.
This policy has deeply disturbed Israel. The settlers, for most religious, but not all, have felt betrayed by Sharon, "the father of settlements."
It is today the Israeli left, although contre-cœur, realises that the new pragmatism preached by Sharon is perhaps the first step.
Just as de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has refunded the maps of the Israeli policy.
In recent weeks have been part of mass demonstrations, some while running the violence. A number of settlers have declared that they do not obéiraient evacuation orders.
The army and police mobilized nearly 50,000 soldiers to carry out evictions.
This approach by the force is traumatic not only for the settlers, but also for many other Israelis.
The next few days and weeks can only tell us if the evacuation is quietly or not.
Meanwhile, Sharon has paid dearly for its policy.
Right-wing parties have left the ruling coalition, it has lost its majority in his own Likud party, and his finance minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has left his government.
It is only by inviting the Labour party of Shimon Peres in his Cabinet that Sharon has managed to retain its parliamentary majority.
The question arises naturally on the situation after the withdrawal from Gaza.
Initially, this leaves many governments sceptical, but they have come to realise, as it is said to Washington, that this was the only thing to do.
Among them, as among the Palestinians, some hope that after the withdrawal from Gaza, it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume negotiations that will lead to a final agreement between Israel and Palestinians.
It is a huge mistake.
Even if it is motivated by the best intentions, hopes to resurrect the road map is not realistic.
Future talks will address the issue of final borders between Israel and Palestine, the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and the problem of Palestinian refugees 1947-48.
The chasm between Israeli and Palestinian positions on these issues has not diminished since the negotiations failed to Camp David in 2000, while the fear and lack of confidence has been growing.
Try to engage in negotiations in such circumstances would not only a futile exercise, but could only further increase the distance and suspicion on both sides.
The failure of the project Annan to Cyprus suggests that the good intentions are not enough -- and disagreements in Cyprus are tiny compared to what divides the Israelis and Palestinians.
That is possible?
The only rational way to proceed is likely to recognize the unilateral steps to each side can further promote the cause of the decline in violence and reconciliation.
The Israeli side, other withdrawals of dozens of small, isolated from the West Bank settlements, causing the evacuation of 20,000 to 30,000 settlers, could prove politically feasible and provide the Palestinians a contiguous territory in the West Bank.
The Palestinian side, consolidating control by the Palestinian Authority of a dozen security services and militias would be an important step forward.
The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, acknowledges, but the question is whether it can.
The Palestinian Authority could also take the difficult road to tell the refugees that, contrary to what was said 50 years of Palestinian propaganda, they do not return in Israel, but will have to settle in the West Bank and in Gaza, areas that will form part of the Palestinian État final.
In an ideal world conflicts are resolved to force of agreements and treaties.
But in real life, as the examples of Cyprus, Bosnia and Kosovo, stabilizing and the slow decline in violence can sometimes the same goal, even without formal agreement.
Lack of plausible alternative, one can only hope that this will also be the case for Israelis and Palestinians.

A new world?
Berlin: as of old redevenant fringants under the bugle, military strategists of the Cold War, feel their rate of adrenalin increase while missile defence in the headlines.
Yes, the defence against missiles, proposed by Bill Clinton (reluctantly) and George W. Bush (with enthusiasm) -- and backed solidly by Congress américain- is not the dream of war star by Ronald Reagan 20 years ago: the missile defence programme (nuclear missile defense), American missile defence system, is supposed to catch a modest number of warheads and does not complete protection against the Rockets enemies.
But the question revives the old debates about deterrence, of mutual assured destruction and control of nuclear weapons, and reviving the rivalry between the nuclear powers at a time when nuclear weapons have lost much of their right to be.
Strangely, even as it is not certain that the missile defence programme concluded, the debate raging.
Even if the system works, it will take between 10 and 15 years ago, perhaps more, before it is operational.
So what is bad feeling about something that, if there is a day, may have little impact.
The normally cautious governments are taking their brands as if the future expected in the wings.
How is this strange behaviour?
Certainly not by a blind faith in technology.
After all, the history of missile defence is full of examples of disappointments in technology for its supporters, they are part of the government or not.
No sane person of mind cannot assume that what it has never been before, that is destroying a small number of warheads in flight, will be in a night.
The three tests were carried out so far, one has failed in part, the other two completely, which is why President Clinton has preferred to leave the problem to his successor.
If President Bush, as he said, can now for a new formula, it will be even more time to develop the architecture and design a programme of testing.
And we cannot be sure that will work.
Governments are worried at present, not because of what is possible or not, but about the intentions real or imagined America.
Although the Americans say loud and clear that the missile defence programme is aimed against anyone, only the US is to protect their citizens from countries like Iraq or North Korea, almost everyone is convinced the opposite: the Russians are afraid that Americans want to cement their military superiority (and the inferiority of Russia) for ever; the Chinese were afraid that the missile defence programme is a sign of America's determination that Taiwan remains independent, Europeans fear that the plans of America will create tensions with Russia and between the United States of Europe.
Because what is important, it is the political intentions and not technical capabilities, it is now that the missile defence programme creates problems: it is pushing Russia to the confrontation, makes China nervous and strengthens a European sense of disunity in the United States.
The damage to begin the starting line while the journey remains uncertain.
The political consequences are strengthened by the fact that 30 years ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have given up an effective defence against the strategic nuclear missiles.
Normally, a US defence in the state of embryo, should not cause as much excitement that the missile defence programme.
But the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty banning, for an unlimited, systems designed to protect some of these two countries against such attacks.
Given the way the US proceed with the missile defence programme, they will have to violate the Treaty, or give advance notice of six months to condemn it, what the two parties are entitled to do if they feel that it is vital to their safety.
In the eyes of many, it would mean that America chooses to abandon the structure of the control of nuclear weapons built during the last part of the Cold War.
The Bush administration claims that, because the cold war is over the disappearance the ABM treaty would not endanger the stability.
But the stability is a problem of perception policy of technical calculations.
By limiting the strategic missile defences, the old treaty offers some assurance of deterrence for governments have nuclear weapons.
Its demise would affect all the other agreements on the controls on weapons.
Russia's threat of every scrap if the US leave the ABM treaty.
Even if this threat lack of credibility (that would be first to Russian interests), based on a certain logic.
The main question posed by the missile defence programme is not how to prepare for a world missile defence but how to soothe the concerns current policies.
A few attempts are made quietly in the background.
Legal experts in Washington suggest that moderate preparations for the construction of missile and radar sites does not violate the ABM Treaty and forcing the United States to denounce it.
To date, the Bush administration will await the results of tests before taking a decision.
Moscow and Washington suggested both that a deep cut their offensive nuclear arsenal is possible.
The assurance that the US will participate in the deliberations makes the sceptics European allies more lenient.
The most important measures designed to win the trust, a change of the ABM Treaty in order to allow a limited missile defence is being studied.
The "Niet" from Russia might be final.
And the political turmoil in which have resulted in Russia and Europe to allay perhaps.
But China?
It, it is not part of an alliance (as Europe) or a network of arms control treaty with which political solutions can be found (such as Russia), and it is a contributing factor to the instability in Asia and the nervousness in China.
The trust can be built on a rapprochement between China and the United States.
Unfortunately, there is nothing to indicate that Washington was aware of the gravity of the problem.
The old cold war planners are very disappointed by it.
When they revise the vocabulary and abbreviations of the royal era of deterrence, they discover that it is a lost world.
The missile defence threat not strategic stability between the US and Russia but if it is poorly presented it endangers the long term political vision.
In announcing its determination to carry out a missile defence programme, the United States have created a storm policy that they must take care now if we want to avoid the most damage.

To avoid a lost generation
Everywhere, the young unemployed people to the dogs are a cause for concern.
They are a problem in developing countries which have a population explosion of strong, the equivalent of "baby boom" in the West at the end of the second world war.
But the period that followed the war in most developed countries has been an era of unprecedented prosperity for the baby boom now approach retirement.
The future will also be promising for the 1 billion and a few young people aged 12 to 24 years of developing countries?
These countries should urgently combine investment and political measures necessary to encourage young people, find work, remain in good health, found a family and exercise their citizenship.
The benefit is great if they succeed: faster development thanks to a young population and the reduction in dependence.
In Asia, this "demographic dividend" would be the cause of most of the quarter of economic growth in the region.
Developing countries have already invested a lot as far as younger people.
They are now better educated and healthier than previous generations.
More than 80% of children go to primary school, against 50% in 1970 and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10% to 6.5% during the same period.
But the governments should not be content to invest in favour of children, they must also begin to deal with the new generation of young people.
However, in countries where the vast majority of children completing primary education, few of them have access to secondary school.
The young represent half of new cases of HIV infection.
In the Middle East and North Africa, a quarter of young people are without work.
That raises questions: What is access to secondary education?
It is sometimes illiteracy remains high, even at the end of the primary, or the lack of resources?
Why is there no more young people who know how to protect themselves against AIDS?
Why companies in these countries plaignent-elles often of a labour shortage of skilled when so many students find themselves unemployed at the exit of the university?
An effective policy in the direction of youth is based on three different types of action: more opportunities for success offered to young people, more powers and the offer of a second chance.
Governments must offer more chance of success for young people by improving access and quality of care and education.
This is only in secondary education for pupils to take full advantage of primary school.
However, many young people are still unprepared for the secondary and squares are rare.
Employers are now highly skilled workers.
In countries as diverse as Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia and Zambia, qualifications and inadequate training are barriers to be overcome.
If you want to prevent young people are caught up in jobs without any hope of promotion or may simply have no employment, they must be able to enjoy a better education and training that meets the needs of companies.
Several countries are now easier access to secondary education, particularly through "programmes conditional transfers," which will distribute benefits to the poor families whose children are regularly at school.
These programs have helped increase the number of pupils in secondary in Mexico, Ecuador, Bangladesh and Cambodia.
But for these programmes have a purpose, the pupils have the skills necessary to enter secondary school.
In Morocco, for example, more than 80% of children are doing a first round of education, but less than 20% reach the required level.
The measures are also needed to help young people to make good decisions.
A government cannot replace the parents or the community, but it can attract young people and their families to take charge.
With the information provided and a stimulus, young people will be better equipped to make decisions about their health or on their future.
In Cameroon, intended for young towns, a programme about the sexual hygiene, Horizon young, has helped to increase their knowledge and change their behaviour. Thus, the rate of young women on the use of condoms has risen from 58% to 76% in the group after the programme.
Another example: in the Dominican Republic, the rate of enrolment in high schools has increased when the collégiens have been informed of the amount of wages of those who arrived at the end of secondary education, an amount that they had largely been underestimated.
In Bangladesh, the project of assistance to the female secondary school has helped financially girls aged 11 to 14 years ago to continue their studies and delay of marriage.
Governments should also offer a "second chance" to young people who have failed because of circumstances or bad choices.
The corresponding programmes must be well designed, well targeted and coordinated way to provide adequate support to its beneficiaries.
And, in sub-Saharan Africa, thousands of young fighters -- 100,000 in Sudan -- hope to rebuild their lives for the time of peace, but they were obviously in need of training and employment, and medical care and psychological support.
With the political will, measures based on the efforts of young people themselves to increase their chances of success and their skills, and the offer of a second chance to those who need it, these countries could maximize their demographic advantage.
They can seize this opportunity for growth to improve their prospects of development, or risk a lost generation, aigrie by the lack of future.

In the European paternalism
The Italian presidency of the European Union is a huge responsibility to reinvigorate the enlargement as a key aspect of the new EU.
The best place to start would be to encourage a better attitude towards adopting the euro for the country came to the union.
In fact the paternalistic attitude of EU institutions to the country homebuyers threatens to create a two-tier Europe which will complicate the process of integration.
The country homebuyers have kept their market share in completing the integration of trade with the EU countries at times stronger than in many countries.
Three of them --l' Estonia, Latvia and the lituanie-- have a system of board or a fixed exchange rate with the euro, like Bulgaria, which must join the EU in 2007.
The others have shown for several years their interest in adopting the euro from the beginning, unilaterally in some cases, even before they enter the EU -- a position openly advocated by the National Bank of Poland, and to a lesser degree by the National Bank of Hungary and the national bank of the Czech Republic.
However, despite their progress to get their rate of inflation and interest rates closer to European standards, many of candidate countries fear, with the opening to the movement of capital, prerequisites for accession to the union, to expose themselves to the risk of judgments brutal capital flows and crises cambiaires.
They have learned the lessons of Latin America and Asia in the 1990s.
The euro adoption, they would be very easy to escape such risks and to focus their efforts on the creation of a real growth for their economies.
However, the response of the European institutions and especially the European Central Bank and the European Commission was negative: the candidates are entendirent argued that they must first pass two years in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), where candidates to the euro would prove what were able to their policies.
At the start, even the systems on board were seen as unacceptable, though, as is often the case in Europe, exceptions have been made: the country with the board could keep them even after union membership.
The opposition of the ECB and the Commission for an early adoption of the euro is ill-informed.
What should count for the European Union remains that the policies of any member État are not harmful to other États states.
As pointed out Leszek Balcerowicz, governor of the National Bank of Poland, adopting the euro by the candidates is certainly profits for the candidates while, in the worst case, absolutely no effect for the current members.
Indeed, the combined weight of all the candidates is much too small -- only 6% of GDP of the enlarged EU --pour exert any effect on the euro.
However, the opposition continues the EU institutions has led most of the candidates to abandon the idea of adopting the euro unilaterally, or as soon as possible after their entry into the Union.
Unfortunately, the persistence of the ECB and the Commission now provide ammunition to populist governments in the country homebuyers who rely on the range of exchange rates to escape fiscal discipline that means adopting the euro.
However, such manoeuvres fiscal disqualifieraient probably a country that wants to go quickly in the euro zone.
In fact the accession countries which have not established a system of board have seen their budget deficit --dépassant inflame the 9% of GDP in Hungary in 2002 and more than 5% in Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia -- while significant capital movements have lobbied on their currencies so that they are rising.
This trend sets out the real economies of the candidates to the risks of reversal of capital flows and crises cambiaires that early adoption of the euro would eliminate.
Ironically, the candidates are lecture by officials of the ECB and the Commission on the compromise between the nominal and real.
It seems that the only requirement of Brussels is the growth target of candidate countries, the macroeconomic stability can wait.
Large budget deficits to support growth and inflation is clearly not a problem.
If this sounds familiar, it is perhaps because it takes up more or less the foundations of the planning system is not sustainable in which the accession of candidates was suspended in the early 1990s.
It was, of course, the adoption of economic policies that focus on market forces in the former communist countries who brought the gates of EU membership.
Thus, the European institutions should abandon their approach paternalistic and take seriously the concerns of the central banks of the candidates about the risks associated with maintaining their own currency on a long period during which their economy must be fully opened up the movement of capital.
Today, the ECB and the European Commission to support the positions of the populist governments in Eastern Europe who spend the funds they hope to achieve in the future of the EU.
It is time that the European institutions to address a more serious challenges and opportunities for expansion.
They could start by considering the early adoption of the euro by the candidates for a more favourable for both countries with a system of cash allowances for those using a floating exchange rates.

The European disaster of Blair
When the Dutch and French voters rejected the proposed EU constitution, everyone was quickly realised that the European project was in a difficult situation.
The painful battle of last week on the medium-term future budget has further confirmed the verdict.
She also sad end to the presidency of the European Council, recalling that Britain continues to maintain its long-standing reputation exception in the European Union.
The two facts are inextricably linked.
In France and Holland, voters have not explained why they voted against the draft constitution.
However, many commentators have believed that the vote reflected their protest against the admission felt rushed the ten new États states, and especially the poorest countries of central and eastern Europe.
Specifically, it seems that the voters have been afraid of losing their jobs, at the expense of crowds of migrants from the East. This fear has been amply illustrated, at this time, by the image of the Polish plumber cheap.
The irony, of course, is that most of the old États states have refused to the new member states full and immediate access to markets in the Western jobs.
However, it was too late to protest since the ten countries were indeed become full members of the Union.
But now the 25 États states must face the economic consequences of enlargement, not only on the issue of the size of the entire European budget for the next seven years, but also on the distribution of donors and recipients.
The key question is how the old États states are willing to pay to boost the economies in behind the new member states.
In fact, the battle took place on three fronts and has opposed Britain, France and the new États states.
Traditionally, a large majority of the budget was returning to agriculture and the lagging regions.
In practice, huge sums of money have been attributed to the major agricultural producers, is the poorest members such as Greece and Portugal.
À these two levels, the new États states expected to benefit significantly from the EU system.
Previously, in terms of budget, the loser of the mechanisms of Europe was the United Kingdom. À when two-thirds of European spending amounted to agriculture, its agricultural sector was low and, therefore, the British have not received European agricultural subsidies.
For a long time, they have complained about the unfairness of these rules, especially in this period, the United Kingdom was one of the poorest members. It is in 1984 that the conservative government of Margaret Thatcher demanded and got a massive rebate on the British net contribution to the EU budget.
Today, the situation has changed in three key points: first, the reform of European agricultural policy has begun and the proportion of European agricultural budget has fallen by 60 to 40%.
Then, for many years Britain has a faster economic growth than most other États states so that it has become the richest countries in the EU, even in comparison with France and Germany. Finally, the new États states are so poor that the poorest of the old member states that they have a moral argument weight to ask a generous budget negotiated.
The start of negotiations, six months ago, coincides with the start of the presidency of the European Council.
Tony Blair, British Prime Minister, has galvanized politicians in Europe by declaring before Parliament in Brussels that it was "passionately pro-European."
That was the message that the British pro-Europeans hoped for a long time and that they expected the club since the election of Blair in 1997.
Of course, it has never made such a feeling the fact of Britain, over the past eight years.
In addition, because Britain has been one of the lawyers the toughest of enlargement to the countries of central and eastern Europe, we would have expected that, during budget negotiations, the government of Blair is relatively generous and enthusiastic with the new entrants.
Initially, this seemed to be the tactics employed by the British government.
But against all odds, it has adopted a position ethically advantageous in proposing to give up part of its budget rebate, only on condition that the rest of the European Union (and France, in particular) agrees on the fundamental reforms in terms of European agricultural policy.
It took the time for the British understand that since President Jacques Chirac was a flawed and besieged the Élysée until 2007, but have no power, it could not afford to endorse such a bargain.
Once the British have become aware of this harsh reality, they have played their pitiful last card in the management of the negotiations. They have made offers petty and ridiculous, primarily designed to safeguard the small British interests and above all, at the expense of new États states.
How sad conclusion to a presidency opened with great fanfare, six months ago by the statements passionately pro-European of Tony Blair!
The full text of his speech is clear.
Blair is in favour of Europe, but not in it.
He wants to be part of a political Europe, but only if the other États states agree to follow the model of economic and social reform.
The problem is that economic and social reform is simply a matter of national policy and is not part of the powers of the Union. If such a reform should take place in France or Germany, this issue is discussed between politicians and the French or German.
It could take place in the union's powers if the EU to become a real Federation.
Can you say Blair is a federalist, then?
Of course not!
It is mainly a nationalist rash, who lives in fear of the sly Press tabloïde his country.
Then, why it has said his pro-European fervor?
Maybe he ultimately not reflected on the issue.

Europe in the challenge of neoliberalism
For more than 20 years I have argued that the high rates of unemployment to Western Europe could persist.
À the late 1970s, Monetarists made a bet that only a modest increase and temporary unemployment could contain the rampant inflation - and open - the West, industrial, and that the cost of a return to the actual price stability would have been worthwhile.
In Britain and the États-unis monetarist, this challenge has been a happy ending.
Not in Western Europe.
Over the past 25 years, European unemployment has increased as the monetary policy is a tendency and that interest rates were raised to combat inflation.
But when inflation has fallen, unemployment has not fallen, or not.
If the unemployment rate has not reached the level of the Great Depression, he remained high enough to make long-term unemployment, or the fear of long-term unemployment, a shocking experience.
The governments of companies in which the official unemployment rate remains at 10% or more for several generations have poor economic management.
Consequently, it seemed to me for 20 years that the balance behind the policy in Western Europe -- collective bargaining and generous social insurance and tight monetary policies, was sentenced to creak.
The European policy makers seem paralyzed by a double shy.
The central bankers of Europe fear that their political masters of their boss to relax monetary policy, the structural reforms needed to release the aggregate offer are not given and that there is a return to inflation in the 1970s.
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices made to stabilise prices have been fruitless.
Politicians in Western Europe, for fear the opposite effect.
They worry that even after the structural reforms aimed at reducing the attraction of piggyback and motivate employees so that they go to companies, and companies to workers, central bankers will continue to press for tightening the purse strings.
In short, they fear that without increasing production and employment, the net effect will simply be an increase in poverty.
Of course, these fears are accompanied by the hope that the structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony, provoking a boom in employment and production without causing substantial increase in inflation.
But the reality is that any move towards the loosening of monetary policy has been put in place, particularly with the European Central Bank débutante, keen to assert its credibility in the fight against inflation -- and that attempts to structural reforms are hesitant, cut and businesses without enthusiasm.
I am led astray for 20 years ago: the systems of Western Europe have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of people of actual participation in the economic life.
The growth of economies of countries in Western Europe has continued, despite the heavy burden of 10% unemployment, but not as quickly as it could.
Today, it seems that I have finally right, if not to panic, at least concern to me.
The French have rejected the EU constitution, above all (at least according to appearances), because a greater European integration, are they afraid, would result in its wake the enormous costs and the disruption of neoliberalism.
This is something to support the European project "when it comes to tie Germany and France so closely that nobody sees a useful to the war to determine what language should be spoken in Alsace-Lorraine.
It is another matter when the European project means that the French workers will face competition from Polish plumbers, farmers and sellers Turks.
In Germany, voters seem poised to evict the Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, because his allegiance lukewarm to the neo-liberal their dislike.
The problem is that they may find themselves governed for four years ago by Chancellor Angela Merkel, an almost equally committed to the neo-liberal than me.
I believe that Germany would be better in ten years ago, with more neoliberal policies.
But that does not appear to match the desire of the German electorate, which makes absolutely unpredictable the aspect of German politics in four years ago.
Moreover, with the displeasure of northern Europe to central bankers, particularly of the ECB and the euro.
Not that the end of the European monetary union is taken, but it is simply that some have begun to consider a bleak future where the end of EMU would be put to the programme.
What is enough to cower prices of assets around the world.
The successes of Western Europe since World War II are among the most impressive and the most encouraging success of world history.
Everyone should hope that the United Europe today to build on these achievements, rather than see generations of high rates of unemployment put them in danger.
For this, the ECB will have to change.
Europe needs a monetary policy as the unemployment rate fell in Northern Europe is more important than price stability of the continent.
The southern and eastern Europe will suffer inflation, it is unavoidable, because as the regions to develop and industrialisent, the terms of trade is improving, and under the auspices of a monetary union regional inflation can be a step to cross.
The ECB should not try to balance the inflation in the southern and eastern with deflation in the North for artificial reaching targets across the entire continent.

Rescued by taxes
What we are beholden to our arrières-arrières-arrières grandchildren?
What do we take today to reduce the risks posed to our descendants and our planet by the increasing likelihood of global warming and of climate change?
Almost everyone -- except for Exxon Mobil, the US Vice-President Dick Cheney and their servants appointés and their henchmen manipulated -- is that when human beings are burning oil, the carbon bioxyde escapes into the atmosphere, where he is acting as a massive coverage, which absorbs the infrared radiation emitted above, resulting in a warming planet.
Similarly, almost everyone understands that global warming could be more serious, is less serious than existing models suggest, but that this uncertainty is not an excuse to do nothing.
In fact, it should prompt us to better protect ourselves if we knew that global warming will be exactly according to projections average.
Finally, almost everyone agrees that governments, institutions to aim non-lucratif and oil companies should spend more money for research on energy technologies without bioxyde emissions of carbon, or able to remove pollutants from the atmosphere and oceans and cool the planet by sending more solar radiation.
It is clear that rich countries must shoulder the burden of solving the problem of climate change over the coming generations.
After all, they were allowed access to industrialisation and wealth by polluting blithely.
Today, China, India and other developing countries do not have this opportunity and it would be unfair penalties.
It is time now to build, not dismantle or undermine the international institutions which will have to manage our response to climate change in the coming years.
But should we do something different now and during the next decade?
Economists like to think in terms of cost.
And when they see a destructive behaviour with side effects, like the tax.
The charging forces people to feel the damage they cause where it hurts -- deep pockets.
A tax on those who drive the vehicles in the city, for example, is a way to spur the collective intelligence, to decide that the adverse side effects are a good reason to change its behavior.
But it must be a tax.
A 4x4 which passes through 17 miles in town, which consumes 3.7 litres of petrol rejected nearly 3 kilograms of bioxyde of carbon into the atmosphere.
The tax "greenhouse" should be 0,010 €, or 0.38 €1.15 per litre?
This choice will be determined by what we should learn over the years, but today, the amount of tax is more of a philosophical question: how do we think duty to our distant descendants?
Australian economist John quiggin showed an informative discussion on its Web site (
However, critics of this calculation, stress that the world today is poor. The average annual per capita, the purchasing power parity, stands at about €5.
It expects improved technologies and spread to the world a much richer by 2100, with annual growth of 2 percent, it will reach almost €40 per head in terms of purchasing power of 2006.
These critics argue, therefore, we have much more need today of the marginal cost €55 people richer by 2100 will need €400 that they would win by being preserved the effects of climate change.
But what critics often fail to mention is that the same logic applies to the world.
The average annual income per head are now at around €30.600 in America, Japan and Western Europe and less than 4600 per half the poorest of the globe.
The same logic that we need more 55 per today that people from 2100 nquote will need additional €400 to the rich should be taxed more, as every 380 per extra taxes in rich countries are accompanied by an increase in income per head of 55 per in poor countries.
In other words, if the rich are greedy today for our descendants richer, and if we decide to allow them to cope with an ecological disaster, we must now be generous with the poor in this world.
Conversely, if we are greedy today with the poor, we need to be generous with our descendants.
At least that we should do if our actions are based more on moral principles on the leitmotif of Leonid Brezhnev's: "What we have taken, we have."

Take pharmacovigilance seriously
The health threats -- nuclear reactors, firearms, and contaminated feed -- all of us, so governments are playing an active role for the limit, through regulations often successful.
But the situation is very different when it comes to the safety of prescription-only medicine.
In fact, for the regulator, the signal is the poor relation of the public protection.
The scope of the problem is enormous.
Nothing to États-unis estimated that each year the side effects are responsible for the death of 100,000 patients.
If these figures are proven, it means that the deaths caused by drugs rank fourth or fifth leading cause of death (according to estimates on mortality used).
In addition, the annual hospital costs directly attributable to the adverse effects will run into billions of dollars, and all the suffering caused by the side effects which do not lead to the hospital (or the death).
The difficulties to determine the causes and effects should be taken into account.
It is sometimes hard to know whether the death or hospitalization of a patient is attributable to a drug, the disease treated or the Association of both.
This does underline the need to ensure the safety of medicines.
The fact that all drugs, in addition to their profits, producing adverse effects in some patients is one reason to be the signal.
It is necessary to weigh carefully the beneficial effects and unwanted medicines before the vote and use them.
These judgments vary, depending on whether they are issued by a pharmaceutical company, which expects the benefits of its sales, or by a patient who may suffer a serious side effect.
The incompleteness of knowledge is complicated by the estimate.
The rush to put new medicines on the market research often leads to an incomplete on their safety.
More than half of medicines approved a serious side effect is unknown at the time of its marketing authorisation.
One example: when the new class of analgesics called PARP COX-2 was put on the market, regulators, doctors and patients were unaware that these medicines could cause heart attacks and strokes.
Tens of thousands of patients innocent people, perhaps more, have suffered from the side effects before the withdrawal of the first two drugs in this class.
It is difficult to provide a complete list and the harmful effects of drugs.
The rate of spontaneous alerts to the regulatory agencies is low, around 1%, and controls are passive in many countries.
It must also rely on the general reluctance to report the adverse effects of drugs.
Doctors sometimes feel guilty and fear the trial, and pharmaceutical companies are concerned about threats to their profits. The regulatory agencies that they must confront the issue "why this drug has been allowed?"
It is particularly difficult to give an adverse drug when the symptom is common in the age group the user or the disease treated.
As the risk of heart attacks is important in the elderly, many suffer from pain associated with arthritis requiring treatment analgesics, it took six years to make the link between PARP COX-2 and an increase in two or three of the risks of heart attacks.
A recent Harris Survey to États-unis concludes that 60% of adults are not convinced, is not very confident that the drug manufacturers disclose on their information on the side effects of their products.
It is justified, internal documents obtained during recent trials show that pharmaceutical companies are often to submit information critical in terms of security to the regulatory agencies, as the law and fail to pass this information to doctors and patients.
The problems is that the consequences of this neglect of the harmful effects of drugs are no or minimal.
It is time to be serious.
· citizens and governments to signal a priority, and commit the resources needed to solve the problem.
• The penalties for pharmaceutical companies who fail to point out and to provide information on the security of their medicines should be increased substantially for an effective deterrent.
• The agencies must have the means of enforcing the laws for stricter rules are implemented.
• the problem of pharmacovigilance must be considered a failure of the system.
It is not fair to blame the serious adverse effects to doctors, particularly in the absence of comprehensive information on the safety of medicines.
The full cooperation of doctors is essential to solve the problem, but it means an end to their fear of being in court.
This approach works well in the aviation industry: the pilots who point out the mistakes that they have failed to make are not penalised.
· patients must be better informed about the risks of medicines that are prescribed prescription and more involved in their detection and their reporting.
The instructions printed in letters tiny are unnecessary.
• the control of side effects should be more proactive.
This calls for more funding, which should come from the main beneficiaries of the sale of medicines: the pharmaceutical industry, as the monitoring of air safety is funded by the airlines.
Above all else, improving pharmacovigilance will, if we want the efforts are successful, the establishment of an independent body designed to promote, coordinate and give advice to the programme of regulation.
The office is in the United Kingdom.
Other governments should follow this model for their role, neglected so far, guardian of public health.

The virtual enemy
Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 on New York and Washington, and yet it seems that policymakers have hardly heard on the functioning of the terrorist cells and their weaknesses.
The Bush administration used the phrase "war against terrorism" and behaves as if it really was a war of type often where a government to fight another.
However, after five years of effort, the military strategies based on the targeting of a single opponent have worsened the situation.
It is time to understand the new model of conflict in emerging.
For the paradigm "war" works, the Bush administration referred to al Qaeda as an enemy.
In reality, there is no great organiser or financing of terrorist activity.
The attacks in Madrid, Bali and London, and several attempts thwarted the États-unis and in Britain, were all marked by their organisation dispersed.
It is conspiracies generated independently who have used the resources of ad hoc, often at home.
These small operations were also a common pattern internally.
The motives of terrorists differ from cell to cell, the same person to person.
Individuals can be motivated by profit, or the thirst for power, or for political and religious, while others are acting out of hatred or for the great shudder.
In addition, there are big differences in terms of risks and rewards and demands as the escalation of the chain organisational or that one cell to another.
The conventional military models are equipped to decapitate a thing which, in this case, has no head.
The features of this new structure have already been studied in very different circumstances.
Terrorism is the violent version of "virtual company agile."
A virtual company is a small group that house alone in holding just large enough to implement a collective intention.
Companies are unusually innovative virtual, and in business, they are perhaps the only system capable of effectively a single product.
The industry of film production is a glaring example.
In fact, it is without doubt the business model of the future.
Corporate profits from their virtual softness in terms of stability.
À present, most of the price of a product is the huge and inefficient organization which has assembled.
Almost all the creativity and solving the problems are in small businesses and are "integrated" later in the big companies, including the infrastructure is expensive and fragile, and that retains the bulk of profits.
This model is the basis of business today, as the central has been defence strategy.
When you buy a car at General Motors, 80 cents of every dollar spent back to GM, which manages almost alone.
The small suppliers, in fact you provide 80% of the value and innovation, but do not receive 20% of the reward.
Ironically, in-depth research on alternative models have been funded by the US Department of Defense, which, as the biggest buyer of complex machinery of the world, wanted to goods better, cheaper and more.
The research has discovered the conditions and the trigger mechanisms necessary to facilitate the constitution, independent of small groups opportunistic and to enable them to behave as large companies.
Unfortunately, the research programme has been cancelled before its findings will not apply to business, because it threatened to big business.
It is often forgotten that defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld has abandoned a comfortable retirement to reshape the American army in a smaller and more agile, using some of these ideas.
But the organisation of the invasion of Iraq, why Rumsfeld had recommended the use of fewer troops than expected, shows a poor understanding of systems distributed.
While the troops were deployed in a flexible entry and a withdrawal, the Bush administration will use them for an occupation.
The terrorists have shown a talent more to capitalize on the models of operations delivered.
The crowds of texts in the Muslim world on the strategic studies of jihad.
The more experienced in the West is the management of savagery [the management of the brutality], but only because it has been translated and made public.
These books (and the trends they indicate) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly complex in terms of adoption of the modern techniques of management.
Their research will include the young science of the management of the virtual company: how to feed and support auto-organisées cells.
The first lesson for policymakers in the West is perhaps the virtual companies rely on a culture of trust.
Some kinds of confidence can be based on an artificial concept of 'not' rather than real values and direct experience.
This is why the actions of the Bush administration only reinforce the dynamics of the virtual company terrorist.
Bush's rhetoric "them and us" clearly defines a "other" and stand as an enemy cohesive.
His approach "war" help Islamic terrorists to consider the West as a force as United and malicious.
À future, the model of the virtual company will shape the way will be conducted business, which will be given the wars and probably the way government services will be administered.
He promised to separate the management of the finances of the production, involving innovation and economic growth more quickly.
However, if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how to operate these structures, they have no chance to combat terrorist Enterprise agile.

The expansion as a solidarity
Nowadays, it is often said that the sense of solidarity in the European Union has been put in danger, not to say that it has exploded, by the expansion to the countries of central and eastern Europe.
Bulgaria and Romania are bringing their turn to EU membership, and negotiations to be opened up with Turkey and Croatia, it has become essential to question the idea.
The values and interests of the new EU members are most often with those of the first 15 states.
It is true, of course that expansion has fundamentally changed the union and gave birth to new problems and political questions.
However, the new États states of central and eastern Europe are deeply embedded in the economic, social and cultural development of our continent.
The ties that bind us have been eroded by 40 years of Soviet rule, but this has not changed fundamentally the European nature of these États.
My country, Poland, has always had a profound cultural ties with other European countries, particularly France.
We have participated in all the major European developments in terms of music, literature and cinema (with, for example, Andrzej Wajda's solidarnösc, such as "Danton ’, a French co-production).
In sport, too, East Europeans are included for long in the rest of Europe.
Indeed, before the first world war, the national football team in Germany was entirely composed of players to patronymes poles.
But, above all, there is a profound sense among the Hungarian and Polish, Czech and others who feel all of Europe.
What is the true meaning of the word "solidarity" as the dictionary defines the small Robert: "relationship between people who were aware of a community of interest".
The sense of solidarity as a unit of common interests, is also clearly in the 15 members of origin that members of the enlarged European Union today.
The exceptions prove the rule.
The lack of unity in the European Union on the Iraq issue should not be overshadowed the agreements that the États states have reached on all other issues important in terms of international affairs.
For the economic issues, disagreements on a single regulator of the European Union, for example, should not obscure the fact that no État member, new or historic, has never challenged the EU market.
Finally, the enlargement process itself is a symbol of European unity, civil and cultural.
The fact that provoked debate and discussion does not contradict the conviction of all, old and new États states, they have obligation to rebuild a continent after 40 years of division.
Still a few questions which, if they are not the source of division, are disturbing.
Should we fear that Europe is now a continent purely Judeo-Christian and white?
The European Union citizens whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Buddhist could identify with the values and culture "of Europe?"
Will it be able to feel you have always done Poles or Czechs?
These questions are especially valuable, in fact they cannot be avoided in the case of a possible Turkish membership in the European Union.
The European integration is driven by the values of others?
Is it to share them or to help it?
These are tough questions.
They are particularly difficult if we look at culture as the cement of Europe's future.
All European countries probably thought at the beginning that newcomers than Europeans would be treated on the same way that the Polish immigrants were involved in the Ruhr German in the 19th century.
The fact that this has not happened, at least, does not mean that this cannot happen.
There is only to see the number of respectable citizens of Turkish origin living in Germany.
Or the large number of British India and Pakistan of second generation that we see now dress tie with laptop, always between two aircraft.
Europeans should admit that these people represent only a minority.
The number of groups of immigrants in Europe are themselves rejected by their communities because of the impossible social and economic integration.
The constant threat of terrorism has made the insulation of Islamist groups in Europe even more dramatic.
The European Union simply cannot say the "solidarity" as a central value and do nothing to encourage those who feel marginalized.
They must be allowed to feel this "relationship between people who were aware of a community of interest".
The European solidarity cannot survive this neglect and do not survive.

After Kyoto
The treaty of the Kyoto Protocol is now in force for 126 nations who have signed up to date.
It is time now to begin to question the following: how to get all the nations, including the major emitters, to discuss what to do after the treaty expires in 2012?
This is exactly what has recently made the European Commission as he unveiled its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era, which will be examined by the European Council in March.
While the Kyoto Protocol is only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries (5.2% between 2008 and 2012 compared to 1990 levels, with targets variables depending on the country), real progress can be made by supporting the development efforts and preserving our planet.
But first, all countries must include the concerns of climate in the planning of their policies and improve governance in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure and transport.
In other words, we must act by being aware that climate change and its effects on residents of rich and poor countries remain a threat to world security.
Ultimately, the long-term approach will probably a system based on rules, a system of incentives and investment in terms of technological change.
The adaptation at national level will be increasingly recognised as a major issue which will require adequate funding.
The treatment of the effects of climate change and the treatment of emissions reductions should not be ruled out one another, but be complementary.
Consider the post-Kyoto world we offer the chance to start a new dialogue and to consider the new options on climate change.
The nations could establish a more ambitious goal which would be to limit the change on the long term of the Earth's temperature, then to allocate emissions rights between the countries that restrict ultimately temperature increases to an acceptable level.
That would need to increase investment in research and development on energy in order to develop technology for both new and better, a process that must be supported by more solid partnerships between public and private.
Until now, with only 15% of the world population, rich countries are responsible for more than 75% of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), and therefore most of the environmental damage.
However, it is developing countries (and therefore poor countries around the world) who are most vulnerable.
It is unrealistic to ask the poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to energy and clean technologies, the costs associated with technological change as expected.
In collaboration with its partners, the World Bank supports financial strategies designed to help developing countries to deal with the costs due to climate change.
To date, more than $1 billion invested in projects GEF (Global Environment Facility - funds for the global environment) and approximately $8 billion placed in the financing, have been engaged in schemes linked to climate change.
While the regulatory mechanisms of Kyoto and the European system of tradeable emissions trading scheme (European) have contributed to the creation of an emerging market for trading of carbon, interested parties are now worried for the immediate future.
Without regulations after 2012, the new opportunities for the beginning of transactions based on projects will end in 2006 / 2007.
Given the long delay between the preparation of projects and the first benefits of emission reductions, the developers of projects have only a few years before them to act before the payments of carbon to make a significant contribution to finance projects in the context.
The development of projects related to infrastructure is a long process that requires between 3 and 7 years, identification via licensing, financing and the construction, until the first certification of cuts in carbon emissions.
The projects must be operational later in 2007.
The World Bank has contributed greatly to move the financing of carbon as a tool of sustainable development and to facilitate the private sector participation in the market.
The bank is focused on the representation of the interests of its country borrowers, helping them to develop assets for the trade of carbon in their own priorities.
But without the involvement of governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012, the carbon market will remain uncertain and the private sector (indispensable to the success of the market) should not extend its participation in a significant and lasting.
According to a recent study, supported by the World Bank on companies interested in the financing of carbon, only a society on five surveyed said that she was interested in emissions reductions after 2012.
The opportunity now to look ahead and mobilize the world community (all the country without exception, albeit with different responsibilities) in the quest for a safer world, a world that would prevent the terrible risks of environmental degradation and social conflict involved by inaction.

État art or art of État?
September is traditionally the month where the orchestras and opera companies leaving the festivals of Aachen, Salzburg, Tanglewood and many others to return home.
This session is also marked (on both sides of the Atlantic) by the return of concerns on the financial resources of classical music.
The American Symphonique is eurocentriste in almost all areas except for its funding.
While the Americans depend on private donations deductible tax and revenue to fund the performance of classical music, Europeans prefer a direct government support.
Ironically, while the defenders of the arts to États-unis have long demanded the adoption of the European model, "which has produced an artistic life, rich and varied, Europe is being forced to change course and to guide his support system towards greater dependence on private money and revenue.
Unfortunately, the European system of direct government funding is a victim of the European economic growth slow and budget deficits.
The problem is especially for countries that have adopted the euro, as public spending in the sector art will be limited during a time by the obligation to keep the deficit below 3% of GDP.
The pressure on the European institutions performing arts causes concern on several levels.
Traditionally, the European social democracies prefer to distribute goods and services scarce as the concerts and opera companies, according to a system of lines (financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low) rather than by the willingness of each to pay.
This will change now.
Supporters of the Performing Arts in Europe show the États-unis where, among others, even big heads of the orchestra to actively participate in research funding and play an active role in the local community on behalf of the orchestra.
They fear that the same thing happening in Europe.
Some heads of the orchestra, refusing to handle the rapporteur while the baton, refused to États-unis important positions for this reason, believing that it would upset their art.
It said that Daniel Barenboim has left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the demands of fundraising.
But the American experience shows that use of big names of the art world, as the heads of the orchestra, to take part in fundraising, does not necessarily the artistic profession.
Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco, for example, has combined fundraising effective and artistic direction to propel the San Francisco Symphony at the summit of North American orchestras.
The Europeans, concerned that greater dependence on private money to mean a conservative programming, should also be reassuring to see that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most audacious of États-unis.
If the public tastes, private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible.
The corollary is that public money makes it possible, a programming adventure, even if the taste of the public tends to be conservative.
This is one reason why artists in Europe like public money; the release of a regime's exclusive Beethoven or Mozart.
In addition, the public can come to appreciate a directory risky to force it proposes.
Of course, if the public money is reduced to the performing arts, not only they have to depend more private money, but the price of tickets will increase.
Some regret, and prefer the system to queue for tickets because they fear that higher prices would endanger the public future excluding the young.
But low prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny issue of young people's access.
First, young people may not take advantage of cheap seats, simply because whatever the cost, classical music is not interested.
Then, even if they want to go there, it is sometimes impossible to obtain places, which are often more available because the subscriptions are among the same hands year after year.
What is the interest of low prices, which serve mainly to subsidise the same holders of subscriptions, if there is no seats?
If the taste for classical music should be subsidised, it must encourage subsidies more focused than low prices.
The best way to attract the youth to the performing arts is to go through education.
Étant given that the American orchestras can count on schools or the government to provide the basis for music education to ensure a constant in classical music, some orchestras are themselves with private money.
À San Francisco, for example, the symphony is a project called keeping score, funded with private funds up to $23 million dollars, which includes a national TV series of radio broadcasts, an interactive learning music and the school music programs.
This type of programme innovative applies as much to the European orchestras that Americans.
The problem of youth and access to the performing arts are two sides of the Atlantic.
As the poor quality of education music in the public school.
If the orchestras are not involved with their own future, they may simply not to have.

The law, the Russian
Throughout the world, we are concerned about the disappearance of political freedoms in Russia, Vladimir Putin.
The Russians are practically the only ones not to worry about this creeping authoritarianism.
They seem less concerned about the political freedoms that by the social protection: pensions, family violence, children's rights or police brutality.
In fact, most Russians are indifferent to the government's efforts to restrict freedom of press and the right to protest.
This apathy makes my job as a mediator, an institution in the Duma (parliament) to protect the political rights in Russia, difficult or impossible.
The ombudsman serves as a bridge between authorities and the people; it is trying to resolve conflicts between the bodies of the state to citizens.
My office is open not only to the Russian citizens, but also to foreign nationals and stateless people who believe that their political rights have been threatened.
We are applying the Russian constitution, but also the principles of international law and standards on human rights, sometimes at odds with our Constitution.
For example, as a mediator, I am opposed to the restriction of the right of the Russians to be sworn.
Those who wanted to limit the use of panels were supposedly for national security.
My office has worked closely with the state to ensure that most of the trials to proceed with jury.
Similarly, my office has defended the weekly liberal novoe Vremya, subject to pressure by the City of Moscow on the pretext of a trade dispute with a lease.
The dispute is resolved, but following my speech, the Moscow authorities are forced to take account of the negative attitude of the public in their attempts to censor the newspaper.
Of course Russia provides examples of problems relating to the fundamental political freedoms and much more to the headlines, as the dirty war in Chechnya, or the Yukos affair.
My office is as much as possible to Chechnya, although this is not easy for Moscow.
I could spend all my time, but Russia has 89 regions and countless human rights issues to resolve.
This is why I suggested to Mr Putin that Chechnya has given its own regional mediator, there permanently.
The new Chechen authorities appear to be welcomed.
In the Yukos affair, my office cannot intervene in any legal process.
The lawyers of the former director general of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, filed complaints with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
If Mr Khodorkovsky contesting the final decision of Russian courts, it will no doubt appeal before this court.
Only then can I give my opinion.
Many observers insist, however, that people with a criminal investigation should be released on bail and not in jail.
For others, this is not possible in Khodorkovsky's case: It is very wealthy and could easily escape justice and flee abroad.
It is precisely the other people accused in the Yukos affair.
All these problems in the area of human rights to highlight the incompleteness of Russian legal institutions.
For example, the Duma has put too much time to pass legislation on the pressure groups, which in most democracies developed clearly defines the acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.
Khodorkovsky might not have so much trouble if such laws existed.
But the lack of legislation is directly linked to the absence of clear ideas.
Human rights in Russia are often ignored simply because the people do not know they have those rights.
The most important objective for my office is that everyone learns to better defend their rights, and that the authorities take account of the complaints of ordinary Russians.
Unfortunately, most of the bureaucrats despise the values of human rights.
But the real difficulty in my office is not ignorance or legal loopholes: this is the fact that in a legal system inadequately developed as one of Russia, my authority is personal, and requires the support of the media.
The notions of human rights, even rudimentary, can expect an awareness that spread gradually.
My strategic objective is to make better know the ombudsman's office, in order to get more respect and recognition of the citizens and the state.
It is almost impossible without co-operation with non-governmental organisations of human rights in Russia.
I think that one of my tasks is to encourage contacts between these groups and the authorities.
The government's response to these initiatives will help to know whether and how the Putin government intends to include the political and human rights in its "dictatorship of law".

The pope revolutionary conservative
Twenty-five years ago, the Polish people expressed surprise that one of them, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow, has been appointed to the papacy.
Some are frightened, others have shed tears of joy.
Here, as a famous writer, "the second Baptism of Poland."
But even in the euphoria, we did not expect that the new pope is changing as not only Poland, but the world.
His first visit in his native country shortly after his inauguration showed the world the power of the new pope.
The communist police has disappeared from the main roads in Warsaw, the streets have become role models.
After decades of deprivation of their independence, the Poles have suddenly regained their ability to self-determination.
In saying out loud that "we will not be able to Europe without an independent Poland on their card," the pope has managed to sweep the settlement unfair to the war that had permeated Poland to the Soviet power.
Then, at Auschwitz, the Pope said: "I speak on behalf of all those whose rights are unknown and trampled in the world, I am because I am involved, we are all linked by the truth."
At this point in this Golgotha of modern times, he called the Poles who remembered their families in the gazées crématoire Auschwitz and the frozen in concentration camps in Siberia, at a fraternity devoted to combating hatred and revenge, even justified.
Some see the pope as the man who has led to a religious revival; others take for a man of peace.
Some see him as a defender of the poor, others a criticism of the theology of liberation.
For the people of Poland, John Paul II, by human rights, the focal point of his teaching, will be forever the man who gave us the courage and hope, who has restored our historical identity.
Indeed, during the first decade of her reign, the pope gave his all to the fight against the dictatorship, and particularly the communist dictatorship.
The strategy made by the Pope for the Catholic Church and its ability to mobilize millions of believers to its cause have meant that no one can never repeat the question posed by Stalin: "How many divisions the Pope have?"
John Paul II has demonstrated that the moral strength was a weapon powerful enough to undo the division of the world created in Yalta.
Perhaps in part of their position staunchly anti-communist, the Catholic Church and John Paul II often receive the label of ‘ conservative ’.
This suggests that the church cannot coexist easily with a multi-party democracy.
It is certain that in the fight against communism, the Polish church has been conservative, thank God!
It has been conservative in its absolute loyalty to the values évangéliques, the truth of faith, historical identity.
For a system which advocated atheism official and the lie legalised, the church has represented a charge.
However, with the disappearance of communism, the problem encountered by John Paul II and his church at the moment is this: in what language the values évangéliques can be expressed in a world in which the evil is not represented by a political system, but is now in every soul?
What is the message of the Pope for the post-communist world he helped to create?
John Paul II guard undoubtedly distancing itself from the economic ideas and the liberal state tax, he often permissiveness and moral relativism.
The Pope's statements are often marred a criticism of individualism on behalf of values.
He considers the shortcomings of liberalism as being particularly pernicious in the post-communist countries.
The market economy, despite its achievements practices, often seems, in his eyes, short of a heart and a human face.
He believes that the market promotes entrepreneurship at the expense of human solidarity.
John Paul II so passionate to modern western society, with its separation from the world values, and he opposed to the morals of companies just emerged from decades of dictatorship.
As Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the pope has a tendency to believe that this is primarily in the resistance to totalitarianism that man can become truly free and safeguard the fundamental values of civilisation.
I confess that I consider the legacy of Communism with more skepticism.
The pressure of totalitarian has created men such as John Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, people who consider that religious faith has bought the freedom from the lies and solitude.
But it has also created men such as Andrei Sakharov, and Vaclav Havel, who have defended their supreme values by referring to a secular humanism and talking on his behalf.
However, for most people living under a totalitarian dictatorship was certainly nothing ennoblissant; it was more of a daily plunging into the lies, the depravity to spiritual and corruption material.
This is why the post-communist companies do not demonstrate nobility or of any organisation which trancheraient deeply with the West.
The defeat of communism has left a large black hole in the souls of communities, a hole that is now fill by ideas of nationalism, intolerance and Western consumerism.
But the hunch first of John Paul II is correct: the post-communist world (the eastern and western) is a spiritual crisis and the Pope wishes to undermine it as the leading to realise the importance of values higher.
Indeed, by his words and by the example that it shows, the pope disrupts the world: they want to live in the wealth and comfort, and the pope reminds us that we also need to live with dignity.
No label can only apply to John Paul II which is often a set of contrary: rejection of the compromise / ecumenism, tenacity and enthusiasm, opening the intellectual / insistence on theological orthodoxy.
This is a conservative lovers of freedom and a supporter of peace, which condemns the injustice, but that reminds us that Mercy is more important than justice.
It is that it embodies the paradox is Christianity: the sacred principles and sustainable associated with the understanding and tolerance.
Twenty-five years after the departure of John Paul II in Rome, we, the Poles, remain grateful for getting us to regain our freedom.
It is a good thing that John Paul II is here.
A world in which everything changes needs a watchdog to monitor what does not change.

The syndrome interventionist
Kosovo often plays the role of conflit-test for the concept of speech "humanitarian".
But while Iraq between the spiral of chaos, diplomats and the leaders of all nationalities are again if it is appropriate for alliances of nations or the international community to intervene when a sovereign country seems unable or unwilling to defend its citizens against genocide or war crimes, ethnic cleansing.
At the centre of this debate is the so-called doctrine of "responsibility to protect."
As a mediator in Kosovo, appointed by the United Nations over five years I have had the unique opportunity to observe the effects of this doctrine after NATO intervention in the former Yugoslavia in 1999.
Kosovo has become an international experience of building society, conducted by the interim administration mission of the UN in Kosovo (UNMIK).
Experience is the right word here.
Indeed, Kosovo has turned into a tube to test of international intervention.
I have lived and worked long enough to Kosovo to see the result, and I claim that such experiments that require more extensive research.
It seems clear that the need for international intervention in a crisis depends on each specific period, and a rapid response is often necessary.
However, military, where such interventions are considered it is vitally important to concentrate the international policy discussions on the rapid deployment of a civilian presence and safety concerns in hand.
It is even more true when the human suffering is caused by conflict, as was the case in Kosovo.
The immediate deployment of a civilian presence and adequate safety immediately after the end of the NATO bombing of 1999 could provide appropriate mechanisms to protect against the backlash that has allowed the victims to become perpetrators.
The peacekeeping forces of NATO did not prevent the abductions and disappearances, the murderous revenge and the massive destruction of property by ethnic Albanians, which resulted in a large ethnic cleansing reversed the population non-albanaise (predominantly Serbian).
A consequence of this neglect, a residue of social and political venomous imbued with Kosovo.
Instead of calming the community conflicts, inter-ethnic hatred is fiercer than ever.
The lack of security and civilian presence to reassure each community in general, the lack of legal mechanism to render justice quickly for crimes committed during and after the intervention has created an additional tension.
This tension is so pervasive, in fact that any prospect of open if necessary reconciliation process must now be changed to a distant future.
Similarly, Kosovo, the international community has spent little time to help the former combatants to consider their collective responsibility for the atrocities that their personal involvement has been directly or indirectly.
Without such an effort, trying to improve the situation is tantamount to build a house on a pile of sand.
This lack of foresight and projects in the aftermath of armed intervention is not only dangerous for the people officially "saved", it is counterproductive.
When a humanitarian intervention is not structured to provide basic security, the underlying differences that inspired the speech at the base is strengthened, not diminished.
Six years after NATO intervention, Kosovo is more than ever of stability and social peace.
Despite repeated assurances from the authorities of the UN that Kosovo is on the path of reconciliation and genuine autonomy, the NATO representatives indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province to "ensure that the political process will be put in place with success."
This leads me to another key point: an exit strategy is as important to the success of any humanitarian intervention in the future that the strategy of entry.
For international intervention has a real chance of success, it is early on to define the criteria of the "success".
One such clarity can be properly an end to the commitment of international players.
In Kosovo, such clarity and has been lacking; therefore, NATO and the UN have no clear idea about the time or on the way they must withdraw.
A day, someone quite rightly said that it is easy to bomb, but much more difficult to rebuild; it is relatively easy to dissolve a military regime, but it is much more difficult to build a robust civil society and durable in his place.
The General Assembly should keep this idea in mind when it begins to codify the doctrine of "responsibility to protect."

The divisions of the right in Central Europe
Europe is going to achieve a certain political stability?
Since 1989, the election results have continued to oscillate between right and left.
Vicktor Orban, the young and skilful Hungarian prime minister he will put an end to this situation?
Thanks to a brutal programme designed to absorb his political rivals on his right-wing Civic party, Fidesz (Hungary) has managed to have almost as many members that the Socialist party on his left.
He also benefited from the internal conflicts in the Socialist Party, which have harmed one of its main assets: his strict discipline and professionalism, inherited from communism.
The efforts made by vicktor Orban to gather under the banner of Fidesz right split have been partial success and are unique in Europe.
Since the collapse of communism in the Czech Republic in Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, the right-wing parties are fragmented, moderate and lack of genuine political perspective.
Although these countries has not yet fully met for several decades of Communist management, the divisions of the right have facilitated the election victory of the left, sometimes by the former communists.
The right-wing forces in central Europe face problems similar to those faced by the right-wing parties elsewhere in Europe, where the Democrats where liberal ideas, to deal with them as only the centre of the political spectrum.
In central Europe, this phenomenon has been amplified by the fact that the ruling parties, all political persuasions, had to privatise the economy and put under pressure from the European Union reforms in the West would have been performed by the right.
In several countries of Central Europe, the left have been better placed to carry out these reforms to the right, because, paradoxically, they have greater legitimacy to that.
Many people believe that the socialist may launch in privatisation or does not attaqueraient social protection if there was no absolute necessity.
In central Europe, the fundamental problem of the right is his lack of identity clearly defined.
Although the politicians of the right-wing moderate claim formally traditional ideologies, liberalism or conservatism, for example, their electorate, little accustomed to the Western political concepts, does not understand the significance of these terms.
Many polls show that a significant part of the electorate of various countries in central Europe is itself to the right, but decades of communism to type paternalistic moved far to the left, the centre of gravity in the region.
Thus, a person can simultaneously declare themselves liberal and ask that the government continues to subsidise the energy, education and housing.
Under the communist regimes, the ideology was just an instrument of power.
As this time, even today many people accept formally ideological labels, but does not want insofar as they can remove a tangible benefit in the short term.
This cynicism to ideologies that creates the abrupt changes of heart of the electorate.
The problem of identity is exacerbated by the upsurge of nationalism. Most of the central European countries in which the building of national identity has been delayed by communism succumb to nationalist sentiment that can be manipulated by politicians.
Although some of them say they are right, the image of Vladimir Meciar, the former Slovak Prime Minister, are in fact populists demagogues and authoritarian.
The current situation of the right in the countries of central Europe is also explained by history and tradition.
The political developments in Czechoslovakia during the past 20 years of Communism has alienated the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Poland and Hungary.
While Poland and Hungary have suffered under communism, an internal liberalisation, which has allowed a part of the activity is semi-officiellement control in Communist Czechoslovakia was a strict regime néo-staliniste after the Soviet invasion of 1968.
In 1989, when the communist regime collapsed, the communist parties in Poland and Hungary have turned into left, Democratic and credible. They were able to oppose the right-wing parties that are created.
But in Czechoslovakia, the rigid communist party has not been able to give birth to a Democratic Party, encré left.
Faced with this gap, the right-wing moderate took the free hand and was able to retain a certain unity until 1997.
But the lack of a strong opposition has led to the collapse of the right that has divided and has lost a common language.
In Slovakia, where the nationalist sentiments have played an important role after 1989, the political forces do not fall for the moment on a left-right axis.
The main political battles are taking place between the nationalist forces and populist, in essence undemocratic, and the forces fighting for democracy.
The threat of a return to power of Meciar led all the Democrats, right and left to stand in the same camp.
Even in these circumstances, the right remains divided, allowing a possible return to power of Meciar.
In Hungary, the right has been a victim of the opposition and populist between conservatives and liberals from mainly urban classes.
The right-wing parties have not yet agreed to know if they need to align with traditional ideas of Western inspiration or on a form of conservative nationalism at the Hungarian.
Although the current ruling coalition, comprised of conservatives and populist, has achieved some success, the moment of truth to the right is not yet arrived.
The Polish right wing is the most difficult.
Its problems dating back to the communist era, when the Solidarity trade union has become the main opposition Movement for the Communists, while the unions are generally left.
Since the fall of communism, various groups of Solidarity have wanted to embody the right, sowing confusion in the political discourse.
The Christian Democrat parties linked to the church and the liberal parties have been to some extent marginalised.
The situation is even more complex than it should count with the populist and nationalist parties. They are relatively strong, because they can rely on the farming community which is an important electoral base in Poland.
As in other post-communist countries, especially the democratic forces of the left who have benefited from the divisions of the right.

Fed up with Wal-Mart?
Do you know what vidéo-clip will soon be shivering policymakers in the world?
The economist Thomas Holmes, following a scenario that looks a disturbing to the spread of a global epidemic, has prepared a dynamic simulation cartographique showing the expansion of the États-unis Wal-Mart stores.
Starting with the epicentre to Bentonville in Arkansas, where Sam Walton opened its first shop in 1962, the big-box blinds [magasins-boîtes] giants Wal-Mart have now increased to the point that the average American lives at least seven miles of one of these shops.
It is interesting to note that the shops are changing the way of pétales a flower which is épaississent and extend.
Rather than jumping directly to the coasts, as 80% of Americans live within a radius of 80 km of the Atlantic and Pacific, Wal-Mart has spread organically through a chain of suppliers growing.
Even if every new shop stole some of the clientele of Wal-Mart stores in the vicinity, the effectiveness of supply steadily improving helps keep the overall growth of the chain.
He likes it or hate, Wal-Mart is undeniably a perfect example of the costs and benefits of globalisation.
Consumers spend considerably less than in traditional stores.
For example, economists believe that the food at Wal-Mart is 25% cheaper than in a supermarket chain.
The price difference for many other consumer products is even higher.
See the astonishing fact: with some other shops in the same style: Target, Best Buy and Home Depot, Wal-Mart account for about 50% increase in productivity as much of America and Europe over the past ten years.
Fifty percent!
And the same kind of progress among the chains of Wholesalers account for 25% more!
The idea that Americans have become better at all while the other rich countries stagnaient is very wrong.
The miracle of US productivity and the emergence of trade in style Wal-Mart are practically synonymous.
I have nothing against these great big supermarkets.
They are a boon for consumers to low income, offset in part the tepid growth in wages, many of them have suffered over the past two decades.
And I disagree with some of my friends who snub the Wal-Mart stores and claim there have never set foot.
As a consumer, I love the big-box blinds.
It is certainly the case of trading partners in America; Wal-Mart alone account for more than 10% of all American imports from China.
But I have some reservations about the model Wal-Mart used as a blueprint of global growth.
First, there is the question its effect on the workers on low wages and the smaller retailers.
The investigations reveal that, while remaining within the law, its social policies exploit the gaps in regulation, which, for example, allowing it to escape the burden of healthcare costs for many employees (Wal-Mart provides health coverage to less than half of its employees).
And the arrival of these hypers in a community, crushing retailers set, and often turn their personality dramatically.
Yes, up to a point is the price of progress.
But the loss of aesthetics and the community does not depend only thanks to the statistics on wages and prices.
The big-box blinds are not really cute, hence the name [big boxes].
If their explosive growth continues over the next 20 years, Americans considéreront-ils one day their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure of models balanced growth to the regional level?
Yes, many Europeans, and others, would treat them the simulation video of Holmes replicating the development of Wal-Mart as a horror film.
The French may have invented the hypermarket, forbear from the big box store, but they never intended to allow him to develop without supervision.
The big question for the Europeans is whether they can find ways to use some of the efficiency gains encapsulated by the model Wal-Mart without being overtaken by him.
For Americans, in addition to know what to do when the phenomenon of big-box blinds are essoufflera.
If a large part of US productivity is reduced to let Wal-Mart and its cousins supermarkets continue their expansion insane, what happens when this source of growth are exhausts?
The US economy has many other forces, including its financial system and its dominant position in capital goods, but the fact is that the advantage of États-unis in this sector has not yet been so striking that the phenomenon Wal-Mart.
It is curious to see how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years, simply because it happened during the last ten years.
Wal-Mart and others are a central element of our modern era of globalisation.
They are not really the epidemic that their scheme explosive development is, but their emergence is not completely benign.
Those who wish to emulate the trends in the US productivity must ask themselves today what they would think the emergence of shops in the form of boxes ponctuant their campaign, taking the wages down and causing the death of small retailers.
The Americans to think about the place where is the right balance between aesthetics, community and small price.

Accept the science.
The economic progress in the long term is allowed by the invention and the spread of improved technologies.
The scientific revolution has been made possible by the press prints, the industrial revolution in the steam engine and if India from the famine, it is thanks to higher yields, the so-called "green revolution."
The era of globalisation that we live emerged with the spread of computers and Internet.
So when we are looking for solutions to some of the global problems, the more difficult, we can also find them, at least partly in new technologies to solve old seemingly insoluble problems.
Take the example of poverty in Africa.
All the possible explanations were made and are usually the finger on what the Africans are wrong.
But a visit in the villages of Africa is clearly understand that the problem is more linked to the fight for survival in physical conditions difficult than any other problem to the African societies.
The African farmers produce about one third (or less) of food less per hectare than other operators of the world, which has led to a large-scale famine, exacerbated by the heavy burden of disease.
Malaria is a unique challenge of its kind, mainly due to the species of mosquitoes in Africa, particularly suited to transmit the disease.
Other tropical parasitic diseases are a curse as heavy on the continent.
Add the practical difficulty represented by the roads in poor condition and the scarcity of cars and trucks, and the economic isolation.
The challenges of survival are enormous.
Practical solutions are available, because of the simple and inexpensive technology can solve some specific problems.
We can overcome the low yields through improved seeds specially adapted to the African conditions associated with technology to enrich the soil and water management.
Malaria can be controlled through new mosquito nets in the long life and a new generation of effective medicines.
Other tropical diseases can be controlled, and technology practice to get drinking water to reduce substantially diarrheal diseases.
The mobile phones, the Internet, wireless local and more roads could contribute greatly to break the economic isolation of African villages.
The donor countries are always asking the Africans to change their trade policies, their government institutions, their administrations, and more.
Some of these changes are important but the rich countries sometimes do their part by focusing on everything, except how to finance and to introduce technologies practice to solve practical problems.
The mistakes of rich countries will not result if the African countries had enough money to adopt the technologies needed all alone, but Africa is so poor that she needs financial assistance to escape poverty.
The challenges of development in Africa are just one example of how difficult problems of companies can be solved thanks to the design and the spread of improved technologies.
The same thing will be valid for the choice that will be done the best way to solve the problem of climate change caused by human rights -- one of these global problems seemingly insoluble.
For now, rich countries to change the global climate with millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide each year by the use of coal, oil and natural gas.
In the coming years, China and India will also contribute significantly to increase the amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
And yet no country, it is rich or poor, is keen to reduce energy consumption, concerned that such a move could threaten its jobs, its income and its economic growth.
The new technologies will provide a solution very important.
Already, the cars' hybrid, "which combine petrol and battery, can almost double the fuel efficiency and halving carbon dioxide emissions.
In addition, engineers have developed techniques to capture and underground storage and course of carbon dioxide from burning coal for power stations.
This new technology can reduce 80% carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production.
Costs are relatively modest.
Also consider the depopulation of the oceans due to overfishing.
The global demand for fish is increasing, as well as the world's capacity, which threatens to become extinct species.
A fish improved, in which fish are kept in tanks and breeding ground, is still not be perfect technology, particularly for environmental reasons, and yet it is very promising.
During a recent visit to Africa, a prominent highly stated that in the world, the scientist is more than ever about the farmer, but more than ever of the legislature.
Politicians do not understand science, and are rarely the opinion of scientists and engineers when they want to solve problems.
Everything is seen in terms of politics and elections, and nothing is considered a technical problem for a technological expertise, which is why African poverty is so often attributed to corruption, rather than environmental challenges.
It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can be the solution.
After all, technological advances are also asking for a good government, market forces, the university effective and more.
The policy is also a role to play.
Nevertheless, it is time to acknowledge that governments are poorly equipped to understand the challenges of technological sophistication and the opportunities at the world could take advantage, and that new methods are necessary to ensure that the science and technology the position needed to tackle a broad range of global problems, taking an increasingly urgent.
It is time today that all the major international agencies and governments must take responsibility to use the scientific expertise and technology they will need in the 21st century.

The situation in Latin America
One of the biggest headache in the world economy is undoubtedly the poor performance of Latin America.
Since the early 1980s, Latin America has been blocked, with income per capita income growing slowly (if there was) in the majority of the region and a major crisis.
Many of the policies were tempted, particularly the liberalization of trade, the privatisation of state-owned companies ineffective and the fiscal reforms.
However, something prevents Latin America forward.
The lack of robust growth is even more disconcerting in light of the many benefits and social achievements of Latin America.
The natural resources are plentiful and the land fertile abundance.
The health conditions are not acceptable and all Latin American countries have made progress against illiteracy, the majority with at least 90% of adult literacy.
In addition, the fertility rates have fallen sharply, to reach a rate which the populations of many countries will stabilise probably in the coming decades.
The condition of women has improved and the girls to have equal access to education, with tuition rates higher than boys in many countries.
Latin America is probably known for its culture "macho", but the rate of women in the working population continues to grow and they are increasingly more social and political positions.
Latin America is very proud of other advantages over the long term.
Most of its citizens live on the coasts and enjoy privileged access to international trade, and other live in cities, another advantage for growth.
Indeed, the region is not poor, according to international standards, but stuck in the beach of average earnings, among the world's poorest countries and the high income countries of North America, Europe and Asia.
Why, then the surprising lack of real growth in the past 25 years?
I reject the responsibility on two unsolved problems, but solubles.
The first has existed for centuries: social divisions whose origins date back to the conquest of Native Americans in the 16th century.
More than in other countries, Latin America was born during a violent conquest.
The Europeans have permeated the people amérindiennes and have also brought down, especially in the Caribbean Basin and in Brazil, massive cargo of African slaves.
The companies have become racialement and ethnically complex when the European populations, amérindiennes and Africa have been of mixed marriages, but the trend over the long term of the dominance of enslavement indigenous and youngish African-American, and poverty strong have scarred companies in Latin America.
Even today, income inequality in Latin America are among the world's largest, reflecting the old models of ethnic and racial division.
The inequality of income leaves a large shadow.
The rich are fighting for a long time against taxes needed to increase investment in education and health of poor, thereby perpetuating the profound social divisions and leaving many people without health and the skills required by the global competitiveness.
The situation improves today in some countries, such as Brazil, which bodes well for the future.
In other countries, such as Guatemala and parts of the Andean region, the social divisions are marred by violence and mistrust.
In addition to this problem, a fundamental failure of the economic strategy has been largely ignored, a failure that is reflected in the major difference between the discussions on public policy in Latin America and Asia.
In Asia, the public debate about the technology: how Asia it can catch up?
The Asian governments act with determination to increase the scientific and technological capabilities of their economies.
In Latin America, the technological revolution in the world is much less discussed and the national policies to promote science and technology is hissent rarely at the forefront.
The result, Latin America did not take proper advantage of technological revolutions.
The Asian countries developing now produce computers, semiconductor, pharmaceutical products and software.
By contrast, even the seller star in Latin America, Chile, remains largely an export economy based on resources, heavily focused on exports of copper and agricultural products.
These sectors are technologically sophisticated, but a close to the long-term development.
The situation is far from hopeless.
Brazil has shown predispositions to be a power of exporting technology.
It has succeeded, obviously, to export aircraft and many consumer goods.
Mexico has also started to mobilise a huge technological know-how.
Argentina, Chile and other countries could become agricultural producers, in the vanguard of the agro-biotechnologie for example, if they bothered.
However, Latin American countries have not yet tried to trigger a technological revolution, certainly not with the level of importance, competence, the commitment and the financing of the Asian countries.
Such an outbreak could play a major role in the take-up of economic growth.
Such a policy would commit to significantly increase spending on research and development, as the Asian countries developing.
The Latin American countries must increase spending up to 2% of GDP (currently 0.5%), in part through public support for laboratories and universities, and in part by benefits for research and development of the private sector. They have held the red carpet to multinational companies, as Asia.
They also need to focus more on training in science and technology and encourage a greater proportion of students to receive a university education.
According to government for the school and for the new universities and colleges agrandies can play a big role, as investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities.
The social and technological programme will depend on one another.
Both are asking companies to Latin America to invest more in people who are affected by these programmes, so that the Latin Americans can put themselves at the cutting edge in productivity.
If these investments in every country in Latin America, both rich and poor, the prospects of the region is illumineront considerably.

The price of real estate: a house of cards?
The first city to see a boom was London, around 1996.
This attitude spread to Los Angeles, New York and Sydney to 1997 and Paris in 1998, up to Miami, Moscow and Shanghai in 2001 and Vancouver in 2002.
These cities and others have seen house prices will inflame since then. Prices have risen to at least 50% in constant prices since 2000.
This was the source of windfall profits for the owners but also a problem for any person preparing to buy a property.
Today, rising home prices subsides in some of these cities.
The growth rate in London and New York has slowed down dramatically during the last year and fell to 1% of a real increase in the second quarter of 2004.
Sydney, the prices of homes are actually fell during the second quarter.
Is it the end of the boom?
No other city would benefit?
Worse still, the mood of real estate markets could lead to falling prices?
No one had predicted the boom, to predict the end is risky.
Housing prices have shown a terrible upward movement against the warnings before the end of the festival.
Any prediction on the end of the boom requires an understanding of the reasons for its development in so many different cities.
Curiously, there is no explanation generally accepted because the ultimate causes of the boom is mainly psychological.
Economists prefer to discuss interest rates or the unemployment statistics, concrete and likely to be known.
Of course, these indicators have a legitimate role to play for an explanation of the property markets, but they are simply not to explain the recent boom.
Three causes psychological out of it all: first, a change to the public perception about the sources of value in a changing global economy and growing confidence the public in the cities' glamour 'whose name is known worldwide and finally the simple dynamic exciting speculative bubbles.
Each factor deserves more attention if you want to understand the present market conditions and see the future price trends.
First, the world seems more chaotic than it was ten years ago.
The plummeting share prices since 2000 in most countries gives a little reassuring to the financial assets, stimulating the "safe haven to the quality," is in this case to the stone.
Moreover, terrorism is now seen as a problem for everyone, Indonesia, Spain and Russia have suffered their own tragedies.
We are reassured by investing in stone, and there is little reason to expect an imminent change.
The fear and soaring house prices are encouraging each other.
Then, public confidence in the cities international glamour is growing, thanks to the explosive growth of global communications through the Internet and mobile phone.
As we admire the international celebrities, there is the international centres of business, technology and culture recognised - whose names are familiar to everybody, partout-possèdent a unique value.
As for fear of terrorism and the lack of confidence in the stock markets, the celebrity geographical seems elastic, not to say autorenforcée: New York, Paris and London are famous, they are attractive.
Finally, the infection behind any speculative bubble cannot be ignored.
The current boom has seen the infection spread inside the markets and through the markets, rising prices fuelling the popular excitement - and the rising price elle-même-dans the same town, then in other cities, until the other side of the planet.
Residents of Shanghai may not only struggling real estate prices in London, but the leaders of public opinion in Shanghai, know what is going to London, and boom is in the city makes the possibility of a boom in Shanghai plausible.
By contrast to two other reasons psychological contagion speculation has a natural end.
A speculative bubble, which sustains itself solely on the reaction to rising prices, cannot continue indefinitely.
So where will it take us?
Two of the causes psychological suggests a continuing increase in house prices while the third suggests the end of this movement up one of these days, without saying when.
I bet that some of the cities if highly attractive will continue to attend the slowing of growth in house prices, then possibly to their decline.
Historically, housing prices has always demonstrated strong movements, and prices in all of these cities are still a significant level, even if it is usually a bit slower than a year or two.
If we extrapolate the trends of growth, it seems reasonable to forecast that prices will continue to grow significantly in most of these cities for a year or two, ^ even if the rate of growth continues to decline.
The psychological factors are more important for the long-term prognosis, beyond a year, when the upward movement no longer plays an important role.
At this stage, prices will probably unstable, because the enthusiasm for investment in the stone will collapse probably while the decline in price growth.
Prices in cities glamorous fall significantly in the next recession or when the economy will suffer are the next major shock or even if interest rates rise too quickly.
Then the contagion within and across the markets fall, with falling prices for years.

Water For All
This month, once more, water is the scene in the fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City.
This is an opportune moment: While the attention of most of the world is focused on energy issues, supply and security, hundreds of millions of people in developing countries, still see the supply of fresh water as equally important, if not more.
The investigations by the World Bank in developing countries show that, when you ask the poor people to name the three most important challenges they face, "good health" is still part of this list.
And the key factor that determines whether they will retain the good health is access to clean water.
Today, in the world over a billion people do not have access.
So they are always easier prey to ill health.
The World Bank estimates that by 2035, nearly three billion people, almost all in developing countries, could live in conditions of water shortages, very serious, especially if they live in Africa, Middle East or South Asia.
This will cause the obvious difficulties, but this will hinder the economic growth needed to millions of people to escape poverty.
In Latin America, nearly 15% of the population, or nearly 76 million people, has no access to drinking water, and 116 million people have access to health service.
The figures are worse for Africa and parts of Asia.
This is a situation that few people face in rich countries.
Usually, the citizens of these countries benefit from public services that meet all their water needs, since the drink until irrigation and the health needs.
In addition, other issues related to water, such as the risks posed by the floods have been reduced to manageable levels.
The rich industrial countries have invested heavily in very early and infrastructure, institutions and water management.
The results, beyond the health benefits that it provides to all, have provided evidence of economic growth record: it is enough to examine the hydro-electric investments to understand the positive impact of projects for the management of water in many countries.
Of course, rich countries have some advantages: they have generally temperate climates, where the rains are regular, and are usually little risk of drought or flood.
Even so, they are not immune from disasters related to water, as the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina has been shown.
But the impact of such events on the poor countries is far more important.
The extreme variations of the rains, floods and droughts can have social and economic impact and result in loss of life.
The Coast of the Gulf of Mexico and Central American countries are constantly experience of such tragedies, the deprived communities are the most vulnerable and less able to deal with these events.
The Éthiopie and Yemen are two examples all outstanding one.
The development potential of the Éthiopie is so intimately linked to seasonal rains that huge variations in the rain, and the lack of infrastructure, has undermined the growth and perpetuated poverty.
A simple drought can reduce the potential for growth of 10% in the long term.
Yemen, meanwhile, has no permanent surface water and its citizens are entirely reliant on rainfall, groundwater and floods.
To move forward, developing countries need new infrastructure and better management of water.
Any approach must be designed in conjunction with the specific context of each country and the needs of their respective people, but there is no forced basis with the investment of exploitation of water that ensures that the local communities and the environment can learn tangible benefits soon.
In some countries, the implementation of new infrastructure for the water usually means the creation of channels, pumping stations and dams.
Other countries may need more profound reservoirs, sewage treatment plants more modern and transport systems of water improved.
All this may be designed to improve and extend the water supply for energy generation, irrigation, and industrial use and private, while ensuring security against droughts and some protection against flooding.
The key to the success of any increase investment in infrastructure, water St. increase in investment in the institutions running water.
If the infrastructure is poorly managed, it does not help to improve the health of populations or to support economic growth: the organisation of water and water management must work together.
The infrastructure can and should be developed in parallel with good institutions, well managed, respecting the environment and with a fair share of costs and benefits.
A policy of investment in water that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and provides access to water for all requires a personalized management and a special partnership between the donor countries, developing country governments, the private sector and local communities.
Delegates from the World Water Forum will have multiple opportunities to build and strengthen partnerships.
If successful, the benefits that will draw the poor people worldwide will be immense.

The German state of economic shock
Over the past ten years, Germany has experienced economic growth, the slowest of the European Union, Europe and the slowest growth in the world.
From 1995 to 2005, the German growth will not have exceeded 14.6%, while the average of the old EU was 24%, the États-unis 39,9%, and that of the global economy 45,6%.
What is so bad results in Germany?
According to Franz Müntefering, head of Social Democratic party at the head of Germany, it is simply because the country is already where other people want to go.
The slow growth in Germany, support, is a sign of convergence.
This theory is far from convincing.
Germany has recently been doubled in terms of per capita income by many EU countries including Ireland, the UK, Holland and France and its growth is slower than theirs.
Another theory, more plausible, is that over the last 15 years several external challenges, or shocks have simultaneously rocked the country.
Trapped by its rigidity, his social system extended and a labour market highly regulated, Germany has been unable to react to these shocks and began to encounter problems.
This theory is not one of the British historian Arnold Toynbee that empires crumble because they are unable to respond to the external challenges.
The first shock has been the intensification of globalisation, which caused the massive influx of competition on low wages.
Even if globalisation is a progressive, it won in energy when China has decided to enter the game.
China is ten times the size of Japan, and Japan had not been very easy to manage.
The instruments of precision and optical equipment, for example, Germany have lost their competitiveness when Japan took the stage.
The second shock has been one of European integration, especially the expansion in the north and south.
The dismantling of the borders of the EU has extended to the size of national markets and economies of scale.
But this phenomenon has favoured the small European countries that the big, and has meant more competition for Germany, the largest economy in Europe.
Take, Nokia, the manufacturer of mobile phones.
Thanks to the economies of scale made possible by the common market, Nokia has been able to fully exploit his inventions, while Germany's Siemens had recently decided to drop the market for mobile phones.
The third shock has been the euro. The European currency has caused a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in some countries have reached up to 5 to 7 percentage points more than in Germany.
Freed from the exchange rate risks, international investors do not require more risk premium in these countries and are happy to provide them with all the funds on favourable terms, what was once the preserve of Germany.
Europe is that the benefits, as the capital are now better distributed and growth driven by the German savings to travel further afield and formerly disadvantaged in the euro zone.
However, the benefit is doubtful for the German workers have also sought to use the capital.
The fourth shock has taken the form of enlargement of the EU, which led to the opportunities for trade and investment, but also a surge of labor at low prices.
The average wage levels in the 10 countries that joined the EU in 2004 is only 14% of those of West Germany.
Low wage competition has led to substantial relocation and offshore activities that have enabled the German companies to remain competitive in reducing their demand for labor.
Étant given that neither the trade unions and the German social system could not accept pay cuts, the consequence has been rising unemployment and slow growth.
The fifth shock is the unification of Germany, a failure in terms of economy.
The GDP per person of working age in eastern Germany was 61% of the level of West Germany in 1996, but it is waning today to 59%.
The slow growth of the country has brought down the average German, while the huge demand for public funds is widening public debt.
The weakness of the fiscal position has in turn undermined investor confidence, with obvious impact on economic growth.
These five shocks are historic developments beneficial for the whole world, but problematic for Germany.
If the country wants to face challenges and continue to grow, it needs to relax its labour market.
This is that if wages to make adjustments downward to adapt to new global environment that German workers tens of competitive, and that the country will have a low unemployment rate, by exploiting its human capital until the constraints of capacity.
The new government that voters will likely choose in September will be facing the difficult task of Germans face reality and to introduce the necessary reforms.
Only then we will know if Germany is able to confront the challenge of Toynbee that lies ahead.

The lessons of the tsunami
Many lessons emerge from the tsunami, because both of devastation and loss of life in Asia.
This is proof of globalization, while television showed the striking images of the destruction of homes in the world.
Indeed, it is in these times that the world really does seem to a global village.
Of course, it seems that information on the scale of the disaster put more time to reach the President Bush's Crawford ranch in Crawford, Texas.
But, ultimately, he decided to interrupt his holiday to offer support for the amount has been revised upwards in international competition that promised to take advantage to those who wanted desperately to be helped.
American aid still appears to be mean-spirited compared to the amount offered by countries that do have a fraction of American wealth.
Australia, which is sparsely populated, has offered more than double American aid, Japan has promised 50% more than America and Europe is committed to a five times.
This has helped many observers point out that the richest country in the world was the most miserable in terms of international aid, especially when it is compared to have engaged in defence and the war.
This disaster is international, so it is appropriate for the United Nations take the lead role in coordinating the humanitarian effort.
Unfortunately, in an effort that was widely seen as another attempt to undermine multilateralism, the United States tried to take the head of a "central Group ’ Assistance Programme, ignoring the incessant efforts within the region and in the UN.
What has been the cause of America, she decided later to join left the United Nations in their efforts.
The rhetoric used to save face of the Bush administration, claiming that he was set up a central group in the absence of any effort has slowly been neglected.
The response of some countries in the region was really impressive, showing the battle in the establishment of governments and efficient staff.
Countless details were examined: Thailand was to submit ambassadors in affected areas of the country to help meet the needs of citizens, helped those who have lost everything, passport and goods, to return home, soigna injured, Tim systems for identifying the body and traita the difficulties posed by the shortage of body bags and the lack of places chilled to a conservation corps.
The countries like Thailand have realised that they could cope with the financial consequences for themselves have asked for humanitarian aid to be sent to other countries.
They have asked that one thing: the reduction of tariffs and better access to foreign markets.
They were asking for charity, just a chance to win their own income.
They have received in response, at least as I write, that a silence relentless.
The G7 has chosen to contribute significantly to alleviate the debt.
This is particularly important in the case of Indonesia, including the service the debt amounts to $132 billion, including 70 due to creditors public or guaranteed by the government administrations.
Even without the horrors of the tsunami, the burden of debt would have represented a major obstacle in the development of this country in recovering the consequences of the 1997 financial crisis.
Indeed, the Indonesian debt relief is a convincing case where most of the debts were incurred in loans to the corrupt government of Suharto.
The leaders knew or should know that part of the total claimed would not be attributed to the development of Indonesia.
Moreover, part of the debt was incurred during the crisis of 1997-98, aggravated and extended by the policies imposed by the IMF.
No one pretends that it is possible to alter or prevent the forces of nature.
Instead, we must learn to manage them.
It is now warning systems improved to prevent possible tsunamis.
We already have, however, received a warning on climate change.
Most countries recognize it and went to Rio and Kyoto to act together: even if it is insufficient, the Kyoto Protocol was designed as a good first step.
Unfortunately, global warming will destroy probably the same countries that those who have been ravaged by the tsunami.
The islands of low as the Maldives will be overwhelmed.
We are not yet a global village.
After contesting the scientific evidence highlighting the problems, the biggest polluter of the planet, the United States, has simply refused to act beyond mere appeal to a certain voluntary restriction that we see little to work in America in any case.
The international community must also consider in relation to this absurd that refuses to take responsibility for global citizen.
The optimists say that technology can solve these problems.
Realists will see that in the race long between technology and the environment, it seems that technology is the loser.
The nature, as shown by the tsunami, has its own clock.
Until we have learned to respect it, we will miss all the train.

The accuracy of experts
Every day, the experts we are bombarded with their views on subjects as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivia's coca growers, the European central bankers and the Politburo of North Korea.
À how they are credible, these experts?
An optimistic view is that as long as those who sell expertise compete vigorously for the attention of sagaces buyers (the media), market mechanisms will ensure quality control.
The experts published in the pages of newspapers, or who spend on television and radio, must surely have a good reputation, because otherwise they would have been removed.
The sceptics warn that the media we impose their choice of speakers and they are less interested in the debates reasoned that by the way to adapt to prejudice.
Accordingly, the celebrity may well be linked negatively, and not positively to the accuracy of long term.
Until recently, nobody knew who was right because nobody kept trace the results of these experts.
But a staggered over 20 years ago suggests today that sceptics are the closest to the truth.
I describe in detail in my book expert political judgment: How good is it? how can we "know?
[the political judgment of the experts: What is it?
How do we know?] the original idea was to ask for thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and noted those predictions according to their accuracy.
We have discovered that not only the media does not eliminate the bad ideas, but they are often, especially when the truth is too complex to be presented sharply.
The evidence to fall into two categories.
First, as have warned the sceptics, when hordes of experts are fighting for the limelight, many are tempted to claim that they know more than in reality.
The experts for the worst and best are those who have the tendency to exaggerate.
Between 1985 and 2005, experts were the most optimistic forecasts over 10 years ago which frontlines the chances of major changes on both the financial markets (e.g. a Dow Jones to 36,000) and in terms of global politics (for example the calm in the Middle East and dynamic growth in sub-Saharan Africa).
They have brought the likelihood of 65% of optimistic scenarios that materialised in just 15% of cases.
During the same period, the most pessimistic experts are even more mistaken, exaggerating the risks of negative changes where experts too optimistic were too full of good news, and adding many other (still await the imminent disintegration of Canada, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium and Sudan).
They have given the likelihood of 70% to dire scenarios that have realised that in 12% of cases.
In addition, as had once again predicted the sceptics, experts claim to know more than they actually pay rarely their mistakes.
Indeed, the media they pay much attention while neglecting their colleagues.
You can see this particularly highlighted when, following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, we catégorisons experts' hérissons "and" Foxes ".
The hérissons are those who have great ideas and amourachent grand theories: ideas libertarians, Marxism, environnementalisme, etc.
Their confidence in them can be contagious.
They know how to maintain the momentum of a discussion by increasing the number of reasons, showing that they are right and that others are wrong.
This is what they won the approval of the media.
But they do not know when to build on their brakes mental into making concessions to other points of view.
They take their theories too seriously.
Result: the hérissons commit more mistakes, but they accumulate more success on Google.
The eclectic foxes are best to calm their ideological enthusiasm.
They feel more comfortable in the face of prolonged uncertainty about who is right, even in bitter debates, admit their shortcomings and give legitimacy to the points of view opposed.
They ponctuent their conversations in conjonctions which limit the scope of their arguments, "but, '", however,' "of that."
As they scurry of oversimplifying the Foxes carry fewer errors.
The Foxes are often agree with the hérissons up to a point, before further complicate matters: Yes, my colleague was right when he said that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable, but remember that the blows of États are rare and that the government has many ways to crush the opposition. "
Imagine that your job in the media depends on your ability to expand your audience.
That choisiriez-vous: an expert who balance conflicting arguments and concludes that the most likely outcome is that nothing will change, or an expert who is the public along with stories of radical Islamists who take control and cause a surge in oil prices?
In short, the qualities that make the Foxes more inclined to the accuracy to make them less popular.
À this point, sceptics little charitable gloussent that we have the media that we deserve.
But this is not fair.
No society still has created a reliable method for assessing the results of experts.
Even people who adopted the accuracy have little means to know that they sacrifice when they change their chain to move from boring foxes to hérissons charisma.
This is that comes in a modest proposal that applies to all democracies: the marketplace of ideas works best if it is easier for people to see the exchanges between accuracy and entertainment, or between the accuracy and loyalty to a party.
Do not liraient-ils more reports of experts who had the most often right?
In this case, the experts could become more reliable showing more humility, and the political debate begin to be less strident.
OK, it is not easy to create ways to assess which was right and that would cover the full spectrum of opinions.
But in a world where, as Yeats, "the worst are filled with passionate intensity and lack of conviction," it is worth trying.

What future for Europe?
In many ways, 2005 represents the annus horibilis of Europe.
It has started well, with the approval of the proposed constitutional treaty by the voters in Spain, but it has turned sour when the Dutch and French voters rejected it shortly after.
The vote reflected in part the displeasure of voters to the internal policies and their disappointment about the conduct of government of European affairs.
Governments are then sent to offer more of these cases unsatisfactory.
In the days after those elections, they succeeded not to agree on the European Union budget for the period from 2007 to 2013.
The French and British leaders have engaged in a dispute that has wrecked the summit that followed, just before Britain takes the presidency in July.
Generally, the countries using the European Union presidency to show their ability to solve the problems and move the European Union.
But, since early December, Britain lurks.
In addition to the funeral of the proposed constitutional treaty, it has largely abandoned the issue of the budget.
There is very unlikely to succeed in getting the budget this year, and, at least to quickly resolve the dispute, the European Union will have no operating budget for 2007.
Even if the budget will be adopted, the presidency, which opens on January 1, will not cases depressing.
The biggest problem is the inability to accelerate its growth and to offer jobs to its citizens.
This is mainly due to the big three, France, Germany and Italy, which produce 70% of GDP.
The collective response, adopted in 2000, was the "Lisbon strategy," which aims to make the European Union "the most dynamic economy and more competitive in terms of knowledge in the world" in 2010.
More realistically, it is designed to offer the governments of the incentives needed for the care of reforms to everything that is slowing economic growth and productivity.
This means the clash of a myriad of interest groups, since the industrial lobbies to unions and the bureaucrats transfixed, who have (so far) managed to protect their area.
The strategy is based on the peer pressure and is to show governments who are not going to confuse them.
In fact, however, peer pressure has turned into collusion of peers.
When European Union leaders met in the spring to assess their progress, they have admitted so sad that the objectives of the Lisbon strategy had little chance to be achieved.
They could, at best, now, stop pretending to attach to this strategy and continue their progress in other areas.
Unfortunately, José Manuel Barroso, who presided over the summit in 2000, when he was prime minister of Portugal and chairman of the European Commission, had put his presidency at stake in the Lisbon strategy.
We should expect to see the defending so desperate.
A few good ideas of the Lisbon strategy was to remove the barriers for the exchange of services.
The competition of services in Europe is restricted by countless national regulations which, for example, strictly regulated by the professions, such as the salon or plumbing.
A key features of recent decades is the significant increase in productivity in the field services for États-unis, but this has absolutely no place in Europe.
Guess why.
Because the services account for 70% of GDP and the potential impact of increased competition is important.
However, it is always difficult, politically, to remove the protections.
The European Commission has made a proposal in 2005, even as the Constitution was subject to the votes.
It is hardly surprising that this proposal has quickly was abandoned.
Today, while a large number of groups of private interests are trying to dilute it up to pull all its meaning, this battle is definitely on the agenda of the European Union in 2006.
Europe also blocks progress of the Doha round in international trade negotiations, the fact the farming lobby is fighting to preserve its subsidies.
Many governments fear their farmers to the point of not having the choice not to give, whatever the circumstances.
Europe has accepted the idea of a trade policy.
When the differences are as important as they are in the case of agriculture, there is no latitude for successful negotiations.
There is little reason to remain optimistic.
And what the future of the ECB, which has to adjust its key interest rates by 0.25% after 30 months of waiting.
Experts may not agree on the relevance of this decision, but no one agrees with the many political leaders who say that this small increase will derail the recovery in economic growth.
The acidity of political attacks against the ECB could trigger dangerous debates on the restriction of independence.
Even if it cannot happen, because it would need to amend the European treaty, all the noise is not healthy.
It turns the ECB to its goals, and has filled out the idea that Europe is a bad thing, and, above all, it will be used as a scapegoat by governments failing to explain their failures.
We can expect other anti-bce reactions.

Is Europe in a rut?
The current team of leaders has greatly disappointed.
Yet we have a chance sees the light at the end of the tunnel with their gradual replacement.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, seems more positive on the issue of Europe and more focused on the reforms that his predecessor, but it's hands by the grand coalition that supports it.
In France, President Jacques Chirac, image par excellence of the leader hostage to its pressure groups, swaying in a helpless towards the end of its mandate for 2007.
The two leaders appointed to replace it, Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy, both the government, clashing on the bottom of the agenda of reform, but the years before an election does not encourage radical changes.
Italy, will have to decide if it wants to replace Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who shows no interest for reforms and European affairs, by Romano Prodi, cautious and former European Commission president.
Tony Blair, once a staunch defender of Europe (at least according to the low standards of Britain), may well have to give the power to Gordon Brown, who is known for its lack of warmth towards European integration.
Fortunately, Britain has always been an outsider.
Finally, whatever the light at the end of the tunnel, it may not be shining before 2007, after the elections in France.
Tame politicians on both sides of the Atlantic
Despite the occasional ronchonnements politicians, no one seriously doubt the independence of the European Central Bank nor the fact that monetary policy in the eurozone is therefore well protected against political pressures.
But the recent death of growth and stability pact, killed by Germany, his father, with France playing the role of co-conspirateur and an accomplice complacent, reminds us of a key lesson: the elected politicians are finding it difficult, if not impossible, to abandon an immense power in the area of tax policy.
This applies across the Atlantic.
The Federal Reserve is obviously very independent.
But any attempt to limit the discretion to tax US federal government in the way the stability pact (for example, the law Gramm / Rudman notorious for the Clinton era) collapses always at the end to pressure the president and Congress.
In the years of election, monetary policy can be used to stimulate, if not more, an economy, just as tax policy, and that is the objective of politicians.
But the frivolous use of one of these two mechanisms in order to achieve short-term targets could create long-term costs for certain restrictions imposed on the scope for politicians to influence the macroeconomic policies.
When politicians can control inflation with a decisive influence on the central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, thus avoiding the need for extra tax to repay that debt.
This was a great lesson of the 1970s and early 1980s, when inflation race has forced politicians to give up the power of independent central banks, which only could convince the markets that price stability is restored.
The monetary policy, however, is not a single development of economic policies.
The aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegates to the independent bureaucrats to keep the politicians on the ranks.
Why not, for example, given to an independent bureaucracy, a few goals of redistribution or control over the level of public investment and management of deficits?
An independent tax authority could probably apply the long-term goals of a society in these areas more than the politicians who have their eyes fixed on the next elections.
Indeed, in principle, it is impossible to understand why the monetary and fiscal policy should be considered so different, one being fully delegated to an agency bureaucrat and the other being completely unregulated, left in the hands of politicians.
So why this vast difference exists in reality, both in America and in Europe?
Because the tax policy is the major tool used by politicians to attract and retain the support of a coalition to win voters made up of pensioners, officials and owners of the middle classes, while imposing costs on the coalition loser.
It is not necessary for 100% of voters, but just a sufficient number to win the victory.
The map of tax plays a critical role in the choice of groups of voters to buy.
The tax authorities independent (or tax rules such as the stability pact) stand this policy of fiscal policy, which is expensive.
After all, if politicians cannot win elections by taking money from a few voters (including future generations, who must bear some of the bill) to give to others, they must work much harder to show some ability to produce public benefits for all.
This is a much more complex task.
Of course, the policy also includes the effects of redistribution.
Think of the various effects of interest rates on debtors by opposition to creditors.
The monetary policy is a way more clumsy, indirect and imprecise picking winners and losers that fiscal policy.
The independent central banks can sometimes be a nuisance for politicians, but at least, they can be used as scapegoats when necessary, a role that the political benefits outweigh the costs of the loss of control over a useful tool.
These considerations should guide the choice of the system to replace the stability pact in Europe.
It is now quite clear that national governments, particularly those of major countries, will never accept limits on their hefty fiscal discretion.
They may be withdrawn for their freedom of manoeuvre fiscal long enough to allow the launch of the euro but, under normal conditions, the national governments to see their tax territory.
The European Commission must cease to fight a rearguard battle which is to undermine his credibility, especially in the eyes of small countries, which are the only on which it is possible to apply pressure to accept tax rules.
Realistically, the commission can only ask the national governments to ensure that their tax accounts are transparent and clear.
It is impossible to prevent the use of fiscal policy.
But at least the fiscal measures of a country should not be hidden in the notes obscure footnote in their budgets.
Even this limited target can be hard to achieve.
A lack of strategic openness is in the interests of astute politicians who want to settle a lobby group covering the costs of public largesse to the majority of citizens.
The rules governing the behaviour of politicians should not be written as if officials disinterested and well-intentioned would apply them.
Politicians are ready to take great pains to satisfy their supporters and win.
We can at best hope to ensure that the worst acts they commit to be made to colours.

The European Union its promises to Turkey?
More than 40 years ago, Turkey has applied to become an associate member of the European Economic Community.
The association agreement in 1963, has created a special relationship, crowned by the customs union in 1996.
For all these years, European governments have continued to reaffirm that Turkey could become a member state, provided by the membership criteria.
The formal recognition of his candidacy in 1999 has urged Turkey to undertake a package of reforms without precedent in the area of human rights and rights of minorities, including the abolition of capital punishment, the adoption of guarantees against torture, promoting religious freedom and equality between the sexes and restricting the role of the Army in political life.
If the European Union considers that the membership criteria were met, it must start negotiations at the beginning of 2005.
Otherwise the EU reneging on its political commitments and seriously undermine his credibility in the world.
However, everywhere in Europe, this is viewed with skepticism, because of the size of Turkey and its economic situation, for fear of mass immigration and above all "cultural and social differences," a euphemism, referring to Islam.
We cannot deny that some of these factors are huge challenges.
But they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.
The negotiations with Turkey would be long and might not happen before 2015.
This time would allow Turkey to the union to prepare.
With 80 million inhabitants, Turkey would become one of the major European Union member states.
But the role of the size of the country is limited in the EU's decision-making process, where the political influence more dependent on the economic power.
In addition, Turkey is for several decades a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to think she behaving differently in the union.
Because of the weakness of its economy, Turkey could claim to significant amounts of aid.
But these transfers would depend on monetary policy by the time of membership, the outcome of negotiations and development of the economic situation.
In all cases, the "cap-and-trade" of the budget practised by the EU would avoid an explosion of the financial cost of Turkey's accession.
Immigration should not cause for concern.
The human mobility is limited, and Turkish workers would have probably the right to move freely in the European Union after a long period of transition, perhaps not until 2025.
Given the strong growth expected of the Turkish economy and low birth rates, experts estimate that there would be around 2.7 million immigrants.
Meanwhile, shrinking and ageing population in the bulk of Europe have made immigration.
But among the countries of origin likely migrants, Turkey offers the best chance of successful adaptation.
This is the Muslim population of Turkey, which raised more emotion.
Many have the feeling that Turkey has no place in a European company based on a culture and Christian traditions.
It also fears that Islamic extremists to take a day of Turkey, a fundamentalist state.
As unlikely as secularism is strongly rooted in Turkey, which can be completely ruled out.
But there is in any democracy, where extremist groups could distract the democratic process to achieve their aims.
The best way to avoid such a disaster is likely to strengthen the democratic system, and for it to anchor closing Turkey in a bloc of countries also Democratic.
The European Union, it must decide whether it wants to be a "Christian club" closed, or an open society, strengthened and enriched by its cultural and religious diversity.
Turkey's accession would make a strong response, with particular resonance in the Muslim world.
The need to challenge the arguments against Turkey's accession to the fact that its benefits are rarely mentioned: a single geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, the South Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East regions of vital importance for the security of Europe - and a major transit country for energy supplies; the military capacity, when the EU is developing its new European defence policy; and a strong economic potential, with a workforce young and dynamic.
Meanwhile, it must take account of the risk of rejection of Turkey: the likelihood of failure of the reform process, which would encourage the extremist movements and cause instability and political turmoil at the gates of the EU.
Turkey's entry into the European Union opens up broad prospects and is also challenges to overcome.
But the prospects are far superior.

The game of the democracy.
In Calcutta, where a younger boy; and went on to participate in the game playing my friends, we let it go, but only after chuchoté in the ear of the other words
When we were children, it was important to master the art of cruel
The technique in
This applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions.
Indeed, the organisations which have formally committed to involve all nations in their decisions are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations, while others will only make a mockery of participation.
The World Trade Organisation (WTO), supposedly based on the principle of a country a vote, in reality its agenda programmed in the wings by a small group of nations.
It is now common for international organizations who publish a report all involve the "stakeholders" and reflect their views.
The report of change is generally presented on a Web site and all without exception (NGOs, unions and other civil society organisations) are invited to make suggestions.
This promotes a sense of participation, but as a friend, paid in these matters, has learned the secret is to finally ignore all the comments and writing the report as if there was no website and, as if no participation had been recorded.
Increasingly, free expression of opinion influence or control the government's behaviour.
Consider the US.
The Americans have expressed their opinion freely, in the newspapers, television, in the discussion forums on the Internet, on the war planned to George Bush in Iraq.
Never before such opposition had not shown to a war
What happened, or rather what has not happened, is admirable: almost no effort has been undertaken to muzzle the government critics, as is the case in China and in several countries dictatorial.
But the largest democracies in the world, the US, India, the UK, etc., are more adept at banning the opinions freely expressed to restrict government actions.
The war in Iraq is probably the best evidence.
Leave aside the immorality of war, and God knows how it is immoral! I want to draw attention to this ability and on the trend of democracies to "treat" with (to neutralize) public opinion.
They have adopted the strategy of
When the mûrissent democracies, they become more than ever paid in the management of the opinion, and in most cases in shaping public opinion.
Every comment Hans Blix, on the UN inspections that he ran in Iraq, members of the Bush administration paraphrasaient what Blix said.
This was paraphrasing a subtle Blix's comments in support of the arguments of America in favour of war.
By repeating the comments retouched, the Bush administration hoped that the public would agree to the war.
It can be difficult to overturn a regime totalitariste and hold elections, but the hardest job is to turn the votes of voters in a real democracy.
For those accustomed to living in a totalitarian state, this is not easy to learn the meaning of 'participation. "
Hence the popular belief that democracies, such as wine, bonifient with age.
Although it may be true, the maturity has its own problem.
While the citizens of a democracy are continually to participate, democratic governments are constantly to reach their goals despite the participation.
It is no denying that the civic participation is often only to legitimise the pretence.
We must recognize and address this problem in order to prevent established democracies of atrophy and to help the new democracies to become more efficient.
Because it is not only morally wrong to allow nations and communities feel marginalised and without a voice; it is the best way to frustration and rage and terrorism.

The redistribution of governance in Asia
The government (the way decisions that affect the public interest is taken) became a key factor in determining the pace of development of a country. A successful governance leads to changes.
The failures are punished by the illness, the discontent and stagnation.
On 18 April will be held in Bangkok, a conference to discuss the prospects for improving governance in Asia.
Policymakers in Asia today face a far different from their predecessors fifty years earlier.
The Asian population has more than doubled since 1950, mainly in the poorest countries.
The political system in these countries was adapted for the people of low, stable and rural.
Today, these companies must also deal with urban centres extended that talent and multiple requests from the urban populations.
The world economy has also changed dramatically.
The increase the flow of goods, capital and expertise in the world means that the foreign organisations and individuals have greater influence, complicating the task of national governments concerned by the internal management of their own nations.
Thus, the international institutions such as the WTO has changed the terms of reference in which economic decisions are taken.
The changes in the local economies are also radicals.
In some parts of Asia, living standards have soared.
Foreign investment for the regions or even external altered the structure of domestic economies.
The old models of economic growth, however, such as the direction of exports, or the selective use of import restrictions which produce good results in East Asia in the last century, are less well adapted to the new laws to exchange.
We have to create new rules.
In most Asian countries, the official rules should be simplified and applied more fairly.
"to return to the sources' is essential in three related areas in which the national governments must take the direction: the reduction of corruption, strengthening the rights of property and the consistent application of legal principles.
Few countries can score points in these areas.
The close links between business and governments have been accused of being responsible for the financial crises that have hit Southeast Asia in 1997.
In some regions of South Asia, violent conflicts and the power of interests in place have jeopardised the legal principles.
The result of such failures is that the elites flourish while the mass.
A clear structure of formal rules remains the best antidote to these failures because they reinforce the informal habits for both companies.
The business does not lead to court but in the meetings where the confidence and reputation are essential.
As demonstrated by Robert Putnam, the social theorist, "the social capital" (the networks, standards and social trust that facilitate cooperation and coordination for the benefit of all) is a factor as a result of economic growth.
Given the power to all members of civil society as possible to instill more surely specific goals in efforts to move the nations.
The government, the private sector and civil society all have a role in strengthening the social capital.
But the successful interactions between the sectors simply cannot be sought, without any input and it is essential for the role of everyone must clearly defined.
Many Asian governments recognise the need to redefine their role more clearly.
Following the crisis of 1997, governments have taken out a little more markets, recognising the limits of their ability to act and how important it is to allow private entrepreneurship develop.
However, governments have a role to play in encouraging a supportive environment in which the markets can operate.
The regulation of control and application are two important but different ways to work (say through mixed partnerships between the private and public sector) who are increasingly used in many Asian economies innovative.
The valuable role of civil society in the expression of opinion community that governments cannot reach has also been recognised, but his relationship to the government and business world is more often by the conflict that cooperation.
The role of private sector in the decision-making must also be clearer: where companies are too influential in relation to governments, their needs to make a good can lead to policies promoting the elites, rather than the masses.
The metaphor of the game (with its rules and its participants) leads some to think in terms of international competition.
It is not very good as our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game, where the gains of a nation is the loss of another.
In fact, the nations are not engaged in a competition between each other as it is for companies.
The trade is a positive sum game where all the countries benefit from the exploitation of their areas advantage compared.
A good governance can improve this positive sum game and ensure that businesses and individuals in these countries participate in profits.
It is in some way of thinking to governments as entities in competing with a better service to their people that other governments).
What makes an important role in international comparisons of systems.
In this spirit, the conference of the unctad-undp this month ("governance in Asia: underpinning competitiveness in a global economy," governance in Asia, strengthen the competitiveness in the world economy), will bring together policymakers across Asia to discuss challenges facing the government faces in Asia.
The role of government (the only player to have the legitimacy of a popular mandate) is fundamentally important in the direction of a nation going forward.
The private sector and civil society are, of course, increasingly important partners for governments.
The operation of relations between the participants will be deeply the future development in Asia.

The 18 Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger
Replacing a governor that they had returned to death a year earlier by Arnold Schwarzenegger should be given to voters in California a great pleasure, though tinged with guilt.
Some members of the opposition in Germany adoreraient do likewise with the Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, although they have not (yet!
) found the star of films to replace it.
Several other European governments are also a certain unpopular shortly after their election.
This situation is also true in non-EU countries, such as Brazilian President Luis Inacio recently cheered, "Lula" da Silva, without speaking to the South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, called a referendum to halt the decline in popularity.
It seems that these days, the effects of the electoral success quickly fade.
Each country should therefore be a reminder to preserve the legitimacy of government?
Absolutely not.
Democracy, to borrow the terms of the philosopher Karl Popper, is defined by the ability to remove those in power without violence; it is then, according to this definition, a method of trial and error.
But the leaders must have the chance to govern.
They must have a chance to make mistakes, as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order.
The method by trial and error involves the possibility of being wrong to try again.
The first mistake of voters Californians is ‘ the attractiveness of the immediate future, "which is hardly surprising in a state where the immediate satisfaction is supposedly a fundamental value.
But this desire sometimes seem damning in democracies post-modernes all the countries worldwide.
Indeed, democracy today has adopted a pop culture of fads which disappear as quickly as they came, the pop group the hysterical fans today will be forgotten tomorrow and there are full of other waiting in the wings.
In politics, this situation can be dangerous because it encourages speedy decisions, what is important, according to popular opinion is temporarily.
The call to an increasing number of referendums reflects and would only increase this trend.
Referendums are most snapshots.
Switzerland, with his pace usually slower and its in-depth political debate before the elections, is probably the only exception to this rule.
In general, the referendums are used to measure the popularity of political leaders at a given time, whatever the problem at stake.
If and when Britain will decide on the euro adoption, it is more likely that the outcome of this vote we learn all sorts of things on Tony Blair and the European Union, but very little on the merits of the common currency.
Thus, the arguments in favour of representative government is not negligible.
Democracy is to govern in organizing debates, making important decisions after in-depth deliberations which, at least in the big countries, must be conducted in a parliament of elected representatives.
The parliaments are sometimes act quickly, and perhaps they are obliged to do, but in general, they take enough time to examine the issues in detail.
The parliaments speak before forming the conclusions, hence its name.
Take the case of Germany, where some leaders of the group of Christian Democrats in opposition to burn wants to reduce the government Schröder.
The proposed reforms and have already been enacted by the government is unpopular, and there is little doubt that a year after his re-election, the coalition of Social Democrats and Greens did very little chance to convince the ballot box.
But who can know that voters will think in three years ago when the government's mandate ends?
In the next election, voters, with hindsight, could realize that there was no real alternative to the policies of Schroeder and could even the beneficial effects expected these reforms becoming apparent.
The leaders need time to make and enforce the decisions as unpopular as popular.
They need the courage to parliamentary majorities often insecure on the road to popularity with the ups and downs.
This is why they are forced to take the most painful at their first year on to radoucir ahead of the next election.
The partnership precarious of Prime Minister Tony Blair and the finance minister Gordon Brown perfectly illustrates this kind of tactics.
The leaders who risk their popularity are not worthy of their position.
California has shown a bad example and Californians will probably pay a high price for their mistake.
It will, however, probably not as high as paid by France and a half a century ago, when Louis Napoleon, elected by universal suffrage, has changed, through a referendum too popular, as Napoleon III, this vote is the last in France until the end of the Second Empire.
The Californians, of course, will not be denied the right to vote, but their obstinacy may generate an unpredictable and irresponsible policy of state.
It is certain that democracy means a limited period in the period during which the powerful in the world must be able to exercise their power unchallenged.
A functioning democracy needs to give them enough time to win membership of the elected representatives to legislate and to apply their programme.
These two conflicting imperatives are by nature, but a representative parliamentary democracy is still the best way to ensure the balance between the two.
Anything else would be as stable as the ten best pop songs this week.

Herbert Hoover and the stability pact.
À mid-July, the good and great finance ministers of member states of the European monetary union (EMU) met to discuss the economic situation in the euro zone.
They have ruminé economic forecasts the more recent, who are planning an annual growth of GDP in the eurozone this year at painfully anaemic 0.7%.
Then, except for a single minister, they have all decided that their economy would suffer a little of this scandal or worse.
They have reaffirmed their commitment to the stability and growth pact, which demands of the euro zone countries tax increases and decreases of public spending, increasing the pressure on their economy.
The pact is already pushing Germany to the recession, the Italian government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts quickly enough not to be overtaken by an index of production failing.
However, this does not seem enough to force officials to review their priorities.
Some European finance ministers still consider the stability pact as the "cornerstone" of EMU.
Other stories about the importance of obedience to the "game."
Others believe that recovery is "in the spirit of the pact," even if it remains essential to restore economic growth.
In the Atlantic, all these reasons seem very strange.
The last time that the American government has tried to ensure a balanced budget despite the recession, it was 70 years, under Herbert Hoover's presidency at the beginning of the Great Depression.
For a broad consensus has established the États-unis on the cycle of economic depression, which require the use of budget deficits to relieve the suffering, stimulating demand and drive the recovery.
Economists call these rounds of tax surges of automatic stabilisers.
When household incomes are falling, it is the same income of the public sector.
Tax cuts can increase disposable income.
But, especially when household incomes are falling, the social costs of the government increase, triggering the recovery in demand, production, investment and employment.
The lower taxes and higher costs, expand the deficit in the budget, but with a healthy and effective.
The American side of the Atlantic, the usefulness of those fiscal stabilisers is not in doubt.
Instead, every threat of recession, the political debate revolves around their strengthening by impetus
No more than it is a matter of fiscal discipline.
À every time that proposals to amend the constitution to balance the budget have surfaced, the proposals have always offered exceptions not just in case of war but also in recession.
We know the origins of stability and growth.
The northern European countries, particularly Germany and Holland are always keen to maintain a low between their debt and their GDP and interest rates relatively low.
When these countries have noticed that the southern European countries, Italy and Greece especially, had used a report high between their debt and their GDP and nominal interest rate high enough on their tolerance visible against inflation.
The northern European countries feared that the deficits of the South can create finally spurring a pressure on the part of their debt through inflation of the euro, or more specifically, their leaders were worried that investors fearful for the same reasons are demanding higher interest rates.
The growth and stability pact was intended to maintain the debt of southern European countries to low levels, now and interest rates low enough to reassure investors about the fact that national debt would never be allowed to rise to the point of generating inflationary pressure.
But looking back on the economic problems of the euro zone today, the threat of nominal interest rate high in the long term is certainly not part of the ten major concerns among investors.
At worst, investors do not fear that a high debt lead governments to slow inflation in actionnant issuing tickets.
The problems of the European Union come to an index of manufacturing stagnated, structural unemployment high and low productivity growth, a common agricultural policy unnecessary and unfair and the forecast of structural adjustments to the expansion of the European Union itself.
A certain point of view, it is right that the euro zone finance ministers are ready to maintain their national debt at lower long-term: this is a sign that the victories over inflation won in the 1970s will not be purely and simply ignored.
But it is dangerous to fixated on the past.
There is no safer route to economic disaster of historic day.
As in show Herbert Hoover, when one considers that the economic problems of the previous generation, it may not see the dangers that are directly before our eyes.

The ghosts of our economy past
In the famous novel by Charles Dickens, "Carol by singing" ("A Christmas"), Ebeneezer Carol, a businessman without a soul, was harassed by the spirit of Christmas past.
Today, economists are similarly disturbed by the ghosts undesirable, when they think about the resurgence of economic woes that were believed dead and buried a long time.
This is Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley or Paul Krugman of Princeton, the governors of the American Federal Reserve or anyone else in Japan, economists in the world are concerned about deflation.
Their concerns date back to the economic thinking of fifty years ago, when economists had discovered that the only thing to do against deflation was to avoid it like the plague!
In 1933, Irving Fisher --le predecessor of Milton Friedman to the head of school monetarist américaine-- announced that governments should prevent the Great Depression, avoiding deflation.
Deflation --le steady decline and continuing prix-- urged the world of business and consumers to reduce their spending and hoarding their cash.
This reduces the ability of shops and banks to repay their debts and can trigger a number of bankruptcies enormous destroying confidence in the financial system, which then leads the fear and hoarding under.
Such incentives to hoarding rather than to spend to keep the request to the lowest, and still falling and unemployment grows and grows over a period of time very long that politicians and economists who argue with enthusiasm the policies of laissez-faire cannot accept.
Thus, is that the solution: use the Keynesian monetary policies (lower interest rates) and tax (inflation of public spending and tax reduction) to keep the economy away from the Gulf which makes deflation as possible.
But if this issue was settled more than 50 years earlier, why the same haunt us?
Why is a threat that concerned about both Japan today and that deserves to be cared for États-unis?
À the late 1940s, those who présidèrent to the creation of an international economic order of post-war tried to create an international monetary system that (a) would stabilise the exchange rate for producers and consumers are the dangers of excessive fluctuations and irrational exchange rates, (b) would allow nations to implement their own macroeconomic policies and (c) will report the catastrophic panics that affect not only banks and individuals, but entire nations who produisirent the international financial crisis destructive of the Great Depression.
This results in the creation of the system bretton-wood, where the exchange rates are fixed and variable, which became over the years the system and floating in the 1980s.
Then came the 1990s.
Suddenly, the financial crises incredibly destructive réapparurent following the panic popular in Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Brazil, etc., and looked to the American financial panic of 1873 or the crisis in the Austrian Creditanstalt in 1931.
Argentina to the end of the year 2001 was one of extraordinary fashion to Argentina for Baring Brothers, in 1890 -- if not that politicians and international bankers seemed to have a better idea what to do to minimise the damage they do not appear to be today.
And, if those who bâtirent the international monetary system of post-war worked to put in place safeguards to protect us from the dangers of international financial crisis created by the popular panics, why this kind of crisis renaît-il today?
The truth is that the economic policies familiar with a series of disasters, troquant whoever is the most threatening to anyone who seems more distant.
The États-unis, the Bush administration remains skeptical about the power boost monetary policies and wants to maintain large budget deficits to reduce unemployment, hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits -- investment weakened, sluggish growth, loss of confidence, uncontrollable inflation and depreciation rates of change-- can be skillfully manipulated or will be that after the departure of the Bush team of the presidency.
In Europe, the European Central Bank believe that the danger of inflation, uncontrolled following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the cost of unemployment, which is still too high.
In the developing countries, the capital controls to prevent financial crises is perceived as an obstacle to the attraction of the capital needed to industrialisation, and as a potential source of corruption since the financial flows are somehow in the hands of nephew by Alliance of the deputy minister of finance.
Flexible exchange rates designed to allow markets to indicate the loss of confidence in the currency are exporters in a competitive situation difficult compared to the producers of foreign countries whose prices are beaten by exchange rates somewhat predictable.
Even the substitution of imports, today much criticised, were taken in by developing countries for good (and bad) reasons: the closure of protectionism of the Markets in developed countries in the Great Depression would have disastrous consequences on the economies of developing countries.
The ghosts of past our economy back because the lessons of this are still contracting.
Politicians and policymakers at their economic approach as "the single doctrine."
But what they do, in fact, is to manage the most important issues of the moment at the expense of the disappearance of institutions and policies put in place by their predecessors to control the problems that they received as the most urgent.
The visitors a night of Ebeneezer Scrooge were able to convince him that it was wrong and to open their eyes on his mistakes.
Hope that economists today will also learn from their ghosts.

Justification for humanitarian intervention
I have visited the former Soviet republics in Central Asia in 1998 to take part in talks on democratic development, which took place (or should have taken place) in these countries newly independent.
My hosts were former communist leaders who took the role of democratically elected presidents more or less.
Each of them spoke without constraints of institutions, democratic procedures and respect the law.
But human rights were a matter entirely.
I have presented in each country a list of political prisoners, asking what was their fate.
In one country, the president has immediately decided to release a man accused of organizing a coup.
But even this seeming proved to be morally ambiguous.
The president had not taken a political decision: he had given a favour.
I had received a gift, in itself, just another demonstration of the arbitrary exercise of power, and not a show of respect for moral principles.
In one country, I spoke with an Islamic fundamentalist opposition leader, who was launched in a long civil war against the government.
This man fancied himself president of 'committee of national reconciliation. "
Armed guards to the teeth in nearby, although it strongly supported the concept of democracy.
Indeed, he regarded this as the most likely way to power because the vast majority of people thought exactly like him.
Democracy, insinuait-il more worrying, would allow him to "eliminate" (he has not really address the true intent of this term) the people opposed to his ideas.
In the private democracies of Democrats, there is even more complicated to discuss human rights that procedural formalities, because these rights are not considered "rights" in the legal sense, but simply as the conscience or as gifts in exchange for another valuable asset.
This distinction is particularly important because it draws attention to the limited effectiveness of official legal standards as a means of promoting human rights.
The gap between human rights and the behaviour of leaders has led to change the largest ever occurred in the conduct of international affairs of our time: the advent of "humanitarian intervention."
This change was originally produced outside the established international institutions and the UN system by taking out of a French group Doctors Without Borders who believed that human rights were a more important than national sovereignty.
Doctors Without Borders has introduced the concept of the 'right to speech "in the humanitarian disasters around the restrictions of international law.
The international system was quickly adopted (and transformed), and several humanitarian interventions
The NATO intervention in Kosovo is a precedent that the Secretary of State Colin Powell has used to justify the war with Iraq.
But, so convincing that is causing a humanitarian intervention, military, such actions must be taken under the auspices of the UN Charter.
After all, the promotion of human rights has been the guiding principle of the establishment of the UN.
His task in this area has been declared in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and in the Helsinki accords in 1975, which lent to human rights legal supremacy on the sovereignty of individual states.
But there is a contradiction between the universality and the supremacy of human rights and principles of sovereignty and no interference in internal affairs of member, who are also part of the documents of the UN.
One method to win this conflict is to introduce in the UN charter a new chapter dedicated to human rights and to reshape the Chapter 4, which is the use of force in international relations.
The principle of sovereignty must also be redefined itself.
The world needs a system of granting legal agreements bilateral and multilateral institutions control and surveillance appropriate) to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons.
The legal restrictions on humanitarian intervention is necessary because dictators is used too often to justify a criminal assault.
Adolf Hitler drew up its strategy when it has dismantled Czechoslovakia, supposedly to defend the Sudeten Germans, and later when it invaded my homeland, Poland.
As has again shown in the 1990s, when he was trying to defend the innocent Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, justify the military intervention based solely on the moral principles is too free rein to describe these principles and abuse.
This is why the debate on reforming the Security Council should focus not on the modification of its composition, but on its mission.
The council must be made explicit responsible for "security man" and its protection, in addition to his current role of safeguarding of more traditional notions of international security.
The principle of not intervening in the affairs of a state has never been absolute and globalisation with this challenge with a radical.
The term "international relations" requires a next Westphalian commitments of sovereign nations, who has replaced the next medieval communities defined by the personal allegiance to a king.
But the Westphalian system is now in decline, and the meaning of the state borders.
In the wider context and uncertain, the need to regulate the humanitarian intervention military threat.

What does America?
When the leaders of the richest nations of the world will gather at Evian, France, a question unanswered will dominate the scene: What does America in the world?
It may be useful at this point to highlight the principles and the ideas that underpin American foreign policy.
First, inconsistency is not a vice.
Indeed, foreign policy, inconsistency is often a virtue.
I am not principles, but of politics.
The United States do not meet a 'one size for all "towards the world.
What happened in Iraq should not be surinterprété as a model of American policy towards the countries which use of weapons of mass destruction, that support terrorism or refuse the freedom to their citizens.
In Iraq, the United States have used the strength of last resort against a country with a history of attacks, and after a strong international consensus has developed on the actions that were to take Iraq.
Different policies, adapted to the realities of local, regional and international, will be implemented to address the challenges posed by North Korea, Iran, Syria, and many other countries.
The American military forces are an essential part of the bulk of actions taken by the United States internationally.
But the defence policy is one of the components of foreign policy.
All the threats against the national interests of America cannot be solved by military force.
As the saying goes, the people who have a hammer, all the problems are in form of nail.
The success in foreign policy, as in carpentry, must rely on the appropriate tools to the task.
The partnership with other countries to play a crucial role at this stage.
Despite all American power, there is little that the US can do in the world that they could not have more success with the active involvement of others (governments, international organisations and non-governmental organisations).
The partnership made the discovery of solutions to problems which are opposed to the national interests and the share the burden.
America is based on partnerships in the world war against terrorism. Foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement; the trading partners provide the security of shipping containers to the private financial institutions are to trace the transfer of funds that support the terrorist networks.
Beyond the partnerships, the international institutions are valuable assistance, provided that they be streamlined, have mandates realistic and that their members are committed to standards and common goals.
These institutions can and often move US national interests.
Indeed, it would be difficult to achieve the critical dimensions of American foreign policy (trade nonproliferation until the policies on the environment) without these interests.
The World Trade Organisation is a typical example.
It provides a forum for negotiating new free trade agreements, is seeking remedies against protectionist policies and discriminatory and solve conflicts with trading partners.
But the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to the current realities.
NATO, for example, moving from an alliance of cold war focused solely on Europe to an organisation tailored to meet the challenges of current safety wherever they arise, as in Afghanistan and perhaps in Iraq.
Multilateralism is more successful when it is based on real convergence of interests and values.
The UN and other structures can sometimes be best placed to deal with those of US foreign policy goals.
When the UN and other organisations have been reluctant or fail to rise against threats sinister, America reserves the right to act in less all-embracing alliances and coalitions flexible
This flexibility is an asset of primary importance because of the nature of the challenges that are appearing on the horizon.
We ignore the member who go to the dogs at our peril because the anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can even offer a haven for terrorists, criminals and drug traffickers.
One of our most pressing tasks at the moment is to avoid the implosion of weak states.
Another focuses on helping countries that have engulfed in violence to help them slowly to recover.
One of the impetus for the international commitment of America (and one of the main sources of its global power) is its willingness to make the world best.
Any American foreign policy must involve interests and values for the American public still insists that the national targets Americans are linked to the ideals.
The attraction of American leadership abroad is partly based on the attractiveness of political institutions, society and culture in America, and his enthusiasm to defend human rights and democracy.
Meanwhile, our efforts to promote democracy around the world serving American interests with the objective recognition of the fact that democracies resolving their differences peacefully.
The world today is not irreconcilable conflict between the main concentrations of the global power: Europe, Russia, China, Japan and the United States.
This line of interest and agreement on the rules of the international order offers a promising basis for the management of the common challenges we face.
Our first goal must be to create a world in which governments, organizations and people accept arrangements that will enable them to achieve their shared interests and that reflected the universal values.
We all have an interest to live in a world in which the force is used as a last resort, where terrorism is seen as unacceptable, weapons of mass destruction spread and are not used, free trade is becoming the norm, people goûtent fundamental freedoms, the Democratic values triumph and the law replaces firearms.
Create a world so integrated may sound optimistic, even idealistic, but rarely naive.

The road to the double hélice the structure of DNA.
Fifty years earlier, on 25 April 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the scientific journal
The second major breakthrough came a few months later, when Max Perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules as the myoglobine and the terms of haemoglobin levels.
Since then, the structural analysis by radiographic protein molecules enabled us to understand the biological chemical reactions.
Both discoveries (the structure of DNA and protein structure) turning the day in the laboratory Cavendish of the University of Cambridge.
So why these two memorial stones of the revolution of biology and medicine that have dominated science in the second half of the 20
The major breakthroughs in 1953, were based on physics experiments such as it was at Cambridge since the end of the 19th century.
That legacy has shaped the intellectual environment in which was formed the team père-fils composed of William and Lawrence Bragg and in which Lawrence Bragg, first as a student then as a student researcher, developed in 1912 the ideas that lead to structural analysis by radiographic.
Although Max von Laue, Walter Friedrich and Paul knipping have discovered the diffraction of X-rays of the cristaux was Lawrence Bragg who discovered a way to exploit scientifically this discovery.
The comment by the "Bragg plans," the leaves of atoms capable of diffracter of X-rays to specific ways determined by the separation between the sheets, led to the Bragg to calculate the exact arrangement of atoms of sodium and chloride in a ball of salt.
William Bragg earned a degree in mathematics at Cambridge in 1884 and became a professor of physics at adélaïde in Australia.
In 1909, it revint in England to occupy a chair in Leeds, while continuing his work on the nature of X-rays.
He became director of the Royal Institution in London in 1923, where he drew some young scholars in interest for X-rays.
Among them were two new graduates in Cambridge, William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal, who intéressèrent the problem of the protein structure, Astbury following a request to Bragg to provide X-ray patterns of wool and silk.
Bernal revint to Cambridge as professor of cristallographie structural in 1927 and was promoted as the assistant director of research in cristallographie in 1923, a sous-département of Cavendish Laboratory.
Bernal is intéressa first to the atomic structure of cristaux, metals and minerals, then of hormones and stérols, and some amino acids, the components of the protein.
Meanwhile, Astbury 'set up in Leeds in 1928, where he began to work on the amino acids and proteins.
In describing his fruitless attempts to obtain patterns of diffraction radiographique well ordered from the cristaux the pepsine protein, he wondered if Bernal could help secure the cristaux other proteins.
A friend of Bernal, Glenn Millikan, come to visit a laboratory in Uppsala, Sweden, where researchers had managed to obtain cristaux of pepsine large, recorded some of these cristaux liqueur, still in their mother, to Cambridge.
Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (Hodgkin after his marriage) obtinrent patterns of cristaux lean, just as Astbury, with results also disappointing.
But when Bernal observa the cristaux under a microscope, it notat when the significant amount of water contained in the network of cristaux is évaporait, the order of cristaux it was overturned.
They held the experience to the X-rays, but with the ball surrounded by his mother and sealed in a fortified capillaire glass, earning patterns, including several comments crystalline.
The results of the first moment of definition in cristallographie protein were published in the form letter in the magazine
Max Perutz, having achieved a degree in chemistry in Vienna, joined Cambridge in 1935 to work as a student graduate with Bernal.
The next year, it was excellent cristaux came to terms of haemoglobin levels, and soon the better standards of diffraction X-ray to date.
But the pattern of diffraction seen (the intensity and the positions of individual) is only half the required data to see the structure of the subject of diffraction.
In terms of mathematics, this plan gives the magnitude, but not the stages (i.e., the stages of a movement oscillatoire) without which it is impossible to determine the atomic positions.
With more simple composed of a lower number of atoms, chemistry, could provide important information about the atomic provisions and a solution could be found by trial and error.
But the proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this solution works.
And, despite the huge amount of good data, the solution remained woefully out of reach.
But the faith in the achievement of detailed information on the structure protein from X-ray patterns remained, but only if the information could be discovered.
It was obvious where the chemical had failed, the physical, and his first laboratory, shows the way, a path by Watson and Crick in the epic breakthrough that we celebrate this month.

Separate rooms
The macroeconomic policies, the financial globalisation and development of the institutions of the labour market have exacerbated the inequalities in recent years, not only at the level of income and wealth, but also in terms of access to education, health, welfare, both in terms of political participation and influence.
Even in countries where rapid economic growth, while a set of factors, exacerbated by demographic changes, has led to the transmission of gaps in knowledge, social responsibilities and opportunities of a generation to another.
The United Nations with the report on the social situation in the world, 2005: the crisis of inequality, little country, rich or poor, have been immune to the global trend of the rise in inequality and its impact on education, health and well be social.
There is of course no relationship to simple cause and effect between poverty and inequality in the violence.
But the inequalities and a sense of deprivation contributes to resentment and social instability, and threaten the security.
Excluded and did the future prospects, the young, in particular are often experience a certain anomie and hide in anti-social behaviour and violent.
Not that there is of simple explanation about the causes of poverty.
It is clear, however, that poverty has different conditions and complex, and that his improvement requires a multifaceted approach.
It is difficult to imagine how, for example, "referring poverty in the dustbin of history" (Make Poverty History) does not generate enough to work, educational opportunities and health for all.
It is certain that the world has witnessed some progress in several areas in recent decades.
Access to education for girls has improved and some differences due to the gap between the sexes have been reduced.
In spite of AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has increased almost everywhere in the world thanks to improving public health systems.
However, overall, the gap inequalities remains strong and in some cases it is expanding.
The most important determinant of income inequality today is the lack of wealth, with the increased concentration of ownership of assets in recent years as chief responsible for greater inequality of income in most countries.
Meanwhile, unemployment is increasing, the gap of qualifications and productivity is increasing, as well as the "dé-formalisation" and "dé-méthodologie" that hit the job markets have exacerbated the inequality of income in the world, the number of "working poor" and the impact of the "growth in the number of unemployed" have increased.
No more than the stabilisation programmes and structural adjustment, imposed since the 1980s, really does not have fulfilled their promises of economic growth higher.
The growth almost everywhere in the world over the past twenty-five years has been weaker than in the 25 years, despite the massive growth in Asia, India and some other countries.
Such differences in growth suggests that inequalities in the whole world may not have increased unequivocally.
But the inequalities nationally has escalated in most countries in recent years, largely because of economic liberalization, both nationally and internationally.
Indeed, in many parts of the world, this kind of economic reform has undermined the growth rate and the role the initiator of governments, increasing by general inequalities.
The rare exceptions are usually due to the interventions measured or persistent of some governments.
But there are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has produced a greater inequality in most developed and developing countries with rising unemployment, greater income disparities, the reduction of social protection and environmental degradation.
The liberalisation of the international financial sector, for example, has undermined the use of grants to develop more inclusive and better targeted to promote economic activities.
Furthermore, contrary to the promises of its supporters, financial liberalisation has resulted in net capital movements from those who had the least to those who had the more long-term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity.
Meanwhile, negotiations on the liberalization of trade appeared to ignore the historical trends.
The conditions of international trade in developing countries has got worse: the price of commodities have declined compared to the manufactured products, as the price of tropical agricultural products at the prices of agricultural products from countries tempered, and the prices of generic products, fell as a result of production, protected by the laws on intellectual property.
The trade liberalisation of manufactured products led to a result and a strong increase in unemployment in most parts of the world as the case of textiles this year.
And, while the liberalisation of agricultural trade could improve the income to the export of some poor countries, the main beneficiaries will be different than the richest agricultural exporters.
The countries that import products currently subsidised will suffer.
"The disengagement from the État" which is a large part of the world developed recently has usually meant the reduction in the role of the État, particularly in its ability to manage and support the development, and its social intervention in the areas of public education, health, housing and public services.
The economic liberalisation put in place in many countries in the past 25 years was, from the beginning, a policy questionable and its consequences have become completely obvious.
If the world focuses not on economic policies to address the negative impact of economic inequalities on reducing the growth and poverty, poor and privileged people will continue to live in separate rooms.

It should not follow the Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve of États-unis faces a dilemma, because it must continue to raise rates compared to an economy devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
The inability of the Reserve to raise rates sooner and thereby giving a lesson in the European Central Bank: after a prolonged period of stability to unusually low interest rates, wait too long to raise rates to more normal levels and appropriate includes dangerous consequences.
The reserve Tim time to start the process of normalisation of rates and it is paying the price.
The ECB should not do the same mistake, even if you consider that these two central banks operate under different backgrounds and with the constraints.
The signs of impending inflation abound in the euro area.
Money supply growth is well above target levels for some time, indicating a condition of excess liquidity.
Headline inflation in September, to 2.6%, is superior to the target of 2% of the ECB, as is the latest forecasts for inflation in 2006 (updated forecasts come in early December).
"The moderation of wages may be ending," We warned Otmar Issing, the head of the ECB, implying that energy prices soaring may now run through the general price level (also called on the side effects).
In these circumstances, there is no good reason to wait to raise rates.
Higher energy prices remain at their high levels of today, the greater the likelihood that anticipation of inflation will rise and that the side effects are matérialiseront.
Further procrastination on the normalisation of interest rates from the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation.
It would be catastrophic for Europe and the economic recovery since the ECB would have no choice but to slam the brakes.
No one wants this.
Better to an increase on the basis of 50 points now, allowing the economic recovery to continue in curbing inflation, an increase three or four times higher than that figure later.
The old adage "better than cure," particularly applies in the case of monetary policy.
Judging by the outcome of the meeting last month the ECB governing council, this "prevention" appears close to major step for the euro-zone economy.
Indeed, the pace of warnings of the ECB on the risks of inflation has accelerated in recent months, and what was a "to be vigilant" has become a "are very vigilant" in September, before turning into "vigilance needed about the high risks to price stability" in October.
The governing council takes the risk to find themselves short of adjectives and credibility, if it does not act soon.
The tone of the comments by ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet, during the session of questions and answers that came to the press conference following the meeting in October, was particularly aggressive.
Mr Trichet seemed to appeal to a pre-emption when he said: "We must not let the side effects materialise."
For the first time, the ECB president was willing to admit that the governing council had discussed advantages and disadvantages of an increase in interest rates during their meeting.
However, current interest rates are described as "outstanding" in October, which indicates that the ECB has not yet made the decision to spend.
It is certain that a slowdown in economic activity unexpected or a sharp increase the value of the euro could postpone the inevitable increase in interest rates.
That still seems to have emerged clearly remains that the ECB has used the press conference from October to warn the politicians, unions and the markets that his long period of inactivity on monetary policy is nearing its end.
The process to end is underway.
This new not everyone is happy with.
Politicians, including Jacques Chirac in France, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and Ecofin (the finance ministers of the États members of the European Union), continue to call for fixed rates, and even the lowest rate ever.
But it is easy for politicians to act responsibly when it comes to monetary policy.
They are not being singled out when prices go up, nor were they to repel the genius of inflation in the bottle.
By pushing constantly at a rate cut more important than what the ECB can offer, politicians are the ECB the scapegoat for the poor economic performance in Europe.
Europe is going badly, they say, not because of their own failure to conduct the required structural reforms, but because the rates are too high.
Meanwhile, the ECB does not need to go as far as the Federal Reserve, which has raised its key interest rates by increment of 25 basis points over 12 consecutive meetings, and other increases are predicted.
For the ECB, a 50 basis point increase could be enough at this stage, and rates could be put on hold for some time.
The Fed waited too long to start the process of normalisation, and has been more aggressive in lowering rates in the downward phase of the cycle of interest rates, has had to be more aggressive in raising them in the phase of the rise.
This is not the kind of volatile monetary policy Europe wants or needs.

The West against the world?
The bombings in Madrid have led to the gates of Europe the scourge of terrorism.
On March 11, is now the European version of the September 11 American.
However, America and Europe often seem not to see the world with the same view: the answer to Spain to terrorist attacks, a threat that affects all democracies, was to elect a government promising to end the American-led policy in Iraq.
Should we understand that Europe and America have visions considerably different?
The division apparent on foreign policy is partly due to a misunderstanding about the nature of "Europe".
The European project is the answer to a realistic to globalisation and its challenges.
It was launched to create "solidarity", to promote political stability and strengthen democracy and the social model of Europe.
Having achieved this, Europe should now make a positive contribution to the developments of the world.
It is not of nostalgia for a former glory.
An unprecedented solidarity is now Europe, form, for example in the collective grief and the reappearance of compassion towards Spain; we must build on this vast potential to create a sense of solidarity in the world.
The United States, also victims of a horrific attack, feel drawn to the world, without going to promote a similar pattern of cooperation.
In defending their values and their safety, Americans are fighting to defend the world, particularly the Western world, new threats dark.
The idealism messianic which issued the Europe of Nazism and has protected the Western Europe of communism is now headed to other enemies.
All the attention being focused on transatlantic relations strained, it is easy to forget that our concerns are often.
On issues such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons, Iran, Afghanistan (country in which we entraînons together the future army) and Africa (where the French initiatives and American support have recently to stabilize the Ivory Coast and the Congo), Europe and America, to speak with one voice.
But on certain issues, such as the war in Iraq, Europeans are not ready to follow America to the dark.
The world, and Europe in particular have the fascination and admiration for the United States.
But today, we must remove any sense of fascination and gratitude and realise that further European integration is in the interests of America, which supported him for 50 years.
In the world today, there is enough to do for two to bring stability and security, and to promote shared values.
In particular, "the engine" Franco-German Europe should not be regarded as a potential rival for the United States.
France and Germany are not an axis aspiring to become a kind of leadership alternative to us.
The two countries are rather a laboratory necessary to the internal workings of the EU.
Anyone who thinks that we produce a rival in America has not treated properly.
Indeed, France and Germany are not naturally.
Many of the points between them: the expansion of the EU, agriculture and the national market.
So this is not the
This is all that I do not believe in the imminence of a break.
The majority of Americans are still in Europe, a partner with largely the same goals in the world.
The majority of Europeans see in America, a friend.
We are all allies of the US; our growth strategy and our contribution to global stability depends on the unique nature of our relations with America.
This is why the US should encourage the development of a European security and defence policy, which is simply the share the burden that America has imposed on Europe for decades.
We must forge the European military capability more important to establish a mechanism that allows us to put together effectively when terrorism or other disasters hit one of our democracies, as has happened.
But we also need to create a capacity for independent European military planning for the EU might need to conduct its own operations, perhaps because NATO is reluctant to this.
We, the French, are opposed to the institution of a "two-tier".
But we want a structured cooperation (i.e., some European countries can lead to the establishment of defence capacity) because we are not prepared to leave the more cautious and more hesitant to repeat the Balkan tragedy of the 1990s, when the Europeans could not act and that the Americans wanted (during a time).
The creation of such capacity would be the EU a transatlantic partner more effective.
It is difficult for Europeans to understand why the plans for a European integration closer are seen as anti-American.
The only way to remove these fears is to establish a dialogue more closely and more often.
On the defence and security issues, the doctrine of security of the EU offers a great opportunity to consolidate our common concerns: terrorism and nonproliferation, but also the need to ensure a sustainable development in all regions of the world.
Europe and America must pursue their goals of cooperation, while ensuring that this will never become an alliance of 'the West against the rest of the world ".
Some Western countries have tried to create a "clash of civilisations" based on our troubled times.
Our task is to find a way to give us all to stand up against a country in particular.

India is ready to convert fully its currency?
It is highly likely that the political courage shown by India in its quest for peace with Pakistan in order to end their clash twilight of half a century to the conquest of Kashmir is matched by economic initiatives equally bold.
Indeed, India is progressing slowly towards a truly courageous reform: the international full convertibility of the rupee.
The gold will affect not only economic development in India, but will give a lesson to China to review the gold in the coming years.
Since 1991, India has swung between the devaluation of the rupee and the full convertibility, the Reserve Bank of India (BIS) making a number of foreign exchange controls.
The Indians residents can now have an account in currencies and invest in the actions of foreign companies, while the Indians not residents can return of the legacy / capital of succession.
Indian companies operating on foreign exchanges can acquire property in foreign countries and companies residents are entitled to pay in advance of external commercial debt up to 100 million dollars.
The limits placed on the accounts in exchange for exporters are removed and banks can invest in the capital and money markets overseas.
India is ready for a full convertibility?
The government has always late in the national economic reforms.
The structural reforms and privatization stalled, undermining investor confidence.
But this inability to address the structural problems may expose the economy to external shocks in the long term.
It would be premature for India to open up its capital account immediately.
The stability of the exchange rates is the anchor when the process of major reform of a country has begun.
However, it remains unlikely convertibility of the capital account has a significant impact on the growth rate of one country.
With the gold of the capital account, the exchange rate of the rupee will be determined more by capital flows through the gaps of inflation, given that the inflation rate of India is more or less to the average of 3% of the OECD.
Since India is always a deficit, the rupee could be subjected to pressure following a negative shock.
Although the monetary growth stands at more than twice the rate of real GDP growth, the risk of inflation would probably be low because of a substantial excess capacity.
In the 1990s, despite an increase in output, have been a significant deflation means that the potential yield of India is growing.
The steps towards the full convertibility of the capital account have continued to match the massive growth of currency reserves of India.
Indeed, the availability in foreign exchange of India considerably over the last decade.
Following a surplus capital account and a gap of interest rates of 3-4%, the currency reserves have reached 70,3 billions of dollars in late 2002, enough to cover about 15 months of imports, only $4 billion in 1990.
Following the balance of payments crisis in 1991, the exchange rate of the rupee has been devalued by 20%.
Exporters could exchange 30% of their income to market conditions.
This method has subsequently been replaced by a double the exchange rates, which made the rupee partially convertible (60% of revenues derived from exports could be converted at market exchange and the rest, according to a fixed rate of the RBI, used by the government to finance imports of goods such as oil, cooking oil, fertilisers and lifesaving drugs).
The double the exchange rates has acted as a tax on exports, but it did not survive long, yielding to a unified change in terms of trade.
The full convertibility of the current account has followed in August 1994.
The political debate is then turned to the gold of the capital account, greatly encouraged by the IMF and World Bank.
In May 1997, the Committee on tarapore capital account convertibility has developed a process of liberalisation in three stages in 1999-2000, with an emphasis on fiscal consolidation, a rate of inflation target and a solid financial system.
The crisis cambiaire East Asia was then put the actions in expectations and raised serious questions about the date of the resumption of actions and the need to pursue the gold.
The sudden merger apparently healthy economies said bluntly that the full convertibility should not be strong liquidity outside.
After all, the liberalisation of the capital account could lead to instability in the rate of change and even the country whose availability in currencies are important, could not prevent a run on their reserves.
India must learn the lesson: in case of shock national or outside, the full convertibility could prove a costly and ephemeral.
The key question is whether a full convertibility would encourage the revenue and net capital outflow of funds.
The risk of greater instability in the rupee is compounded by serious problems, including a deficit equal to 6% of GDP and the impasse with Pakistan.
The movement of capital in the short term might happen if one of these two risks empirait, could make even more unstable, the overall efficiency.
So it is vital for India increases the amount of long-term capital, that the capital account to be closed or opened.
In this context, it is remarkable that China, whose capital account is closed, and has reserves totalling $286 billion, or four times those of India, China's economy is that the double that of India.
The full convertibility nor is the solution to draw direct investment abroad (FDI) more important.
China has drawn of FDI to 52,7 billions of dollars in 2002, namely the return of capital the world's most important.
India needs of FDI more important to absorb excess capacity of its economy.
This situation highlights the importance of a successful management of the capital account (control of revenue and the movement of capital) to India after a first step towards a full convertibility.
But on the short term, the full convertibility of the capital account is not in the interests of India.

The theme of the great man
In this era of globalisation, it is large, impersonal forces that are supposed to determine the course of events.
The globalisation of markets, trade stands, militant Islam, the awakening of China: these are things that historians and military strategists usually describe as the main forces that shape our destiny.
Yet for most, we do not see things as well.
Most people will always instinctively "big men" to historical figures, the men (and women) who seem to shape events through their political vision, their personal charm and the strength of their moral views.
By the strength of their conviction and their personalities, such figures, do we believe, can make progress, while providing a glimmer of hope in a universe that posted and impersonal.
This desire to find men or women providentiels in these times of globalisation has just three factors.
Initially, it is the complexity and the vulnerability of our world.
Then, is a paradox, it is critical to our increasingly driven by politics and politicians.
Finally, it is the result of our culture media obsessed she is to put a "face" on the events.
The problem to get positive changes in a national or international, which seems to defy the power of the leaders' normal ', then we turn to new Alexander to untangle the Gordian knot ’ and transcend the complexity of the strength of will and dynamism.
The structural reforms in Europe, for example, are considered impossible to implement unless they were imposed by a reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher.
In the Middle East, everyone awaits the arrival of a new Anwar Sadat in the Arab world.
The disillusionment with the politics and politicians is also an important element of our aspirations for a certain leader.
In France, for example, the celebration, a little too flattering to the tenth anniversary of the death of François Mitterrand mainly reflects the general disillusion caused to his successor, Jacques Chirac.
The indirect criticism of the present is often a key element of an idealized vision of the past.
Less demand for a politician ‘ normal ’, we are looking for a hero.
The world has become a world stage, the role the media in the diet of this appetite for leaders providentiels is essential.
The public calls for quick responses to the complex problems, if they remain unresolved, could endanger the planet.
He needs figures with which it can identify, that it can immediately recognize and, above all, in which he can trust.
The emergence of a "global civil society" embryonic exacerbates the requirement of universal figures and charisma, representatives of any hope of accountability, with some populist overtones.
In a world in search of leaders providentiels, the case of Ariel Sharon is a symbolic and ironic, because this man universal remains one of the most controversial figures in recent decades.
It has become a man almost révéré in his country and Western public opinion usually see its political defeat represents a blow that could be fatal for any hope of progress in the region, even if there is still loathed in many parts of the Arab and Muslim world.
The transformation of Sharon, the traitor become heroes in the area a few years, is a source of fascination for its people, the region and the world, especially as its basic premise will remain open to discussions with no end in tomorrow's historians and politicians who would claim his true heirs today.
Sharon has really been convinced by the demographers as "Greater Israel" that once seemed to be his aspiration first meant the end of the État Jew or its strategy of disengagement focused on "Gaza before it ’ signifiait-elle truly ‘ Gaza only"?
For those who support either of these interpretations, Sharon will be allocated to the benefit of doubt.
That there has been able to compare the attack which has suffered Sharon, in terms of political consequences, to the assassination of Yitzak Rabin demonstrates just how much you combine his personality, with the hope and security.
"The Bulldozer" has become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last asset of Western diplomacy for Americans and, surprisingly, for the Europeans as well.
It only seemed to embody the Association of a reassuring and vision to collect a majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement.
In fact, one wonders if the world has not made of Mr Sharon is a man because he wanted to believe in any force that there was still a possibility of hope in the Middle East.
Était-ce a futile illusion or a prediction that satisfies?
We will ever.
What is certain is that the vacuum created by the departure of Mr Sharon of political life is particularly striking in light of images of the chaos that emerges from Gaza since Israel's withdrawal and the collapse in our view of the Palestinian Authority.
No more than the emergence of a new personality Provident will easily.
It is not all exceptional periods which create their Bonaparte, which is probably better, because the exceptional leaders can give the illusion that all the problems have their solution, which is far from being true.
The natural history in the most optimistic is the Speaker "on the periphery", but the fast pace of technological change, we have to wait for an identical in human affairs.
Many of us believe that such a bet, impossible to be fulfilled by a man alone, with all the hopes and the dangers, that it represents.

The fall of the U.N.
The reign of terror of Saddam Hussein is taking its end.
His government ba' athiste goes down, however, is not alone.
Ironically, the United Nations sombreront with him.
It is possible as the UN does not disappear completely.
The areas dedicated to "good works" (i.e., bureaucracies to maintain peace in the low risk or those who fight against AIDS and malaria or to defend the rights of children) will continue to loom.
The mill to growing on the East River in New York will continue to moaning.
The reluctance of the Security Council to authorize the use of force to enforce its own resolutions on the possession by Iraq weapons of mass destruction rang the bell of the fantasy of several decades that the UN as the basis of world order.
While we reject the remnants of the war to liberate Iraq, it is important to preserve, through the international law applied by the international institutions, the wreckage of the liberal intellectual concept to better understand them.
While the Iraqis free describe the nightmare of Saddam's rule, which lasted a quarter century, we must not forget what are those who supported this war and those who did not, those who said that the moral authority of the international community was chiselled into pleas to obtain additional delays for the UN inspectors and those who demonstrated against the "regime change."
In the spirit of reconciliation after the war that diplomats still want to promote, we should not resign ourselves to the old-fashioned timid notion that the world order asks us to back in front of rogue states who terrorise their citizens and threaten ours.
Decent, thoughtful and full of principles, the millions of individuals who have demonstrated against the resolution to ask for auditors to Iraq were catalysés by the idea that only the UN Security Council had the authority to justify the use of force.
A coalition of voluntary liberal democracies prepared to send their soldiers to stop the evil is not enough.
Never mind that these troops will apply the requirements of the UN.
If a country or a coalition of countries other than the UN Security Council made use of force, even as a last resort, "anarchy" and not the international law, the sets, destroying any hope of world order.
This is believed the demonstrators.
But this idea is dangerously wrong and leads inexorably to justify morally (and even to justify decisions politico-military existential) countries like Syria, Cameroon and Angola, Russia, China and France.
If a policy is right when the Security Council approves it, how can it be wrong, simply because the communist China, Russia, France or a multitude of dictatorships secondary refuse their approval?
Those who opposed the actions of the coalition in Iraq are generally believed that "order" must take precedence over "anarchy".
But is it true?
The UN Security Council to represent the most responsible for ensuring the next and save us from anarchy?
History suggests otherwise.
The UN is the ashes of a war that the League of Nations has proved unable to prevent.
The league was simply not ready to face Italy in abyssinie, and even less, if it had survived this debacle, to fight against Nazi Germany.
In the euphoria that followed the victory in the second world war, hope to make collective security was put into the hands of the UN Security Council for ineffective.
During the Cold War, the Security Council turned out to completely paralysed.
The decision to defend South Korea against the attacks against it in 1950 was taken by the council only because Stalin had ordered his diplomats to boycott the sessions of the UN, which meant that no Soviet ambassador was present to exercise its right of veto.
This was a mistake that the Soviets would be more.
In 1967 and 1973, the UN retirement of the Middle East, leaving Israel defend itself by its own resources.
The Soviet empire was put in the soil and Eastern Europe is released, not by the UN but by the mother of all the coalitions, NATO.
Faced with multiple attacks of Milosevic, the UN failed to put an end to the Balkan wars or even to protect its victims.
You will recall of Sarajevo?
Srebrenica and the massacre of thousands of Muslims under the false protection of the UN?
It took the country of good will form a coalition to save the Bosnia from extinction.
Once the war, peace was agreed in Dayton, Ohio, and not the UN.
The rescue of the Muslims of Kosovo was not due to the UN: their cause has never received the approval of the Security Council.
This century is now a challenge to the hopes of a new world order on new plans.
We will win or not contiendrons terror fanatic, if we bring the war in the territories that the trigger.
We will have to use force against the member who harbor terrorists, as we have done to destroy the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
The states most dangerous are those who possess weapons of mass destruction, the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons that can kill, not hundreds or thousands of individuals, but hundreds of thousands.
Iraq was part of them, but there are others.
The hope to convince them to withdraw their support or asylum they attach to the terrorists is based on safety and efficiency they face.
The chronic inability of the Security Council to implement its own resolutions regarding Iraq, is clear: it is simply not able to fulfil its mission.
So we are only with the coalitions formed by the country of goodwill.
Far from the run as a threat to a new world order, we should recognise that they are, by default, the best hope in this order and the real alternative to the mess created by the abject failure of the United Nations.

Neoliberalism, and then?

Experience suggests that a programme of growth must be rooted in two strategies: an investment strategy designed to revive growth in the short term and a strategy for institutions, designed to give a resilient economy facing adversity economic shocks.
The key to an investment strategy is to look the business premises in the local economy.
To encourage foreign investment or cling to the full liberalisation and then wait until the situation is improving is not viable.
An effective strategy to achieve two objectives: to encourage investment in areas not traditional and prune the projects or investments that do not arrive.
For that, governments must use both the carrot and stick.
Find out what a country product (or could produce) easily is the main challenge of all economic development.
The policy of the carrot is necessary because it is hard to gain socially if we discover, for example, cut flowers, the soccer balls or computer programs can be produced cheaply. Also because this knowledge can direct investments in other entrepreneurs.
The businessman who made the first "discovery" can only capture a small part of the social value aware that generates, and quickly, it is followed on this path by others.
Consequently, entrepreneurship of this type (find out what can be produced) is usually under-represented because of lack of incentives to trade.
It must also use the stick to ensure that these incentives do not manipulate investments or pointless little.
The introduction of such a strategy can vary from country to another, according to the administrative capacity, the system of incentives that prevails, the flexibility of the tax system, the degree of sophistication of the financial sector and the underlying political economy.
The funding programmes limited in time, the funding of public companies and the financing of exports account for some ways to approach to this, but there are many others.
There is no way, which worked everywhere.
The governments that do not possess the skills required to exercise their role as director of private sector are right to the disaster and have little chance of improving the allocation of resources.
It can succeed, but economic growth requires more than the temporary being resuscitated investment and entrepreneurship.
It also requires efforts to build four types of institutions needed to maintain the advances of growth and the strengthening of the resistance to economic shocks.
The institutions to build the market (right of ownership and contract law.)
The institutions of market regulation (outsourcing, economies of scale, professional information).
The institutions to stabilise the market (monetary and fiscal management.)
The institutions of legitimacy for the market (social security and insurance).
Building and solidify these institutions, however, takes time.
Have an initial period of growth to try and innovate on these fronts could prove highly paid.
The key here is in need of institutional arrangements that are specific to each country.
Find out what works in any country implies a certain experiments.
After all the institutions are not plants can be replanted in any soil under any climate.
The reforms that operate in an environment can be weak or lacking in others.
Such a special help to understand why some countries succeed (China, India, South Korea and Taiwan, among others) by combining elements of unorthodox policies altogether.
It also explains why large institutional differences persist among the industrialised countries of North America, Western Europe and Japan in areas such as the role of public sector, the legislative system, corporate governance, the financial markets, the labour markets and social protection.
While the economic analysis can help make choices institutional public voting and the collective choice also have an important role to play.
In fact it considers the democracies public participation as méta-institutions which will make a choice in the "menu" institutional arrangements of each area.
Imagine such a strategy for growth is both more difficult and easier than the establishment of neoliberal policies standardised.
More difficult because the constraints that it needed to growth are often specific to each country and adapt well to revenue standard.
Easier, however, because once these constraints made it objectivées, changes in relatively simple can bring huge economic and pave the way to a virtual circle of growth and institutional reforms.
Adopt this approach does not mean giving up an economic thought standard.
Neo-liberalism represents for the economies neoclassical what astrologie represents for astronomy.
In both cases, it must have a faith rooted in moving from one another.
Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose the classical economics, but only to his bad employment.

The other central Europe
A spectre lingers in the central Europe, while its countries prepare to join the European Union.
This promising development is compromised by an electoral nationalism fevered that seeks to win votes by promising to reopen old wounds and settle old scores.
The most striking example comes from Hungary, where the Prime Minister Viktor Orban has demanded the repeal of the decrees adopted in 1945 by the president (Edvard Benes decrees that confisquaient goods populations of German and Hungarian deported from Czechoslovakia in this period and that their enlevaient their citizenship) in a campaign for re-election, which has not led to the wire.
But Orban not only to see an electoral advantage in evoking memories of old ghosts.
Orban has argued that the removal of ‘ Benes decrees "should be a condition of the integration of the Czech Republic (and the slovéquie) in the European Union.
The ill will inspired by the actions of Orban has suspended a large part of regional cooperation in place during the last decade.
Instead, a new threat to national populism is emerging in the plain that stretches from Bavaria and the Danube.
The chain reaction arising from the awakening of nationalism changes atop the political landscape.
Since the election which brought to power the coalition parties of Wolfgang Schüssel and Jorg Haider in Vienna, Austria with the neighbouring Czech Republic have deteriorated on two points: the requirement that the Czechs are closing the Temelin plant on the Austrian border and revoking the Benes Decrees under which the Sudeten Germans were deported from the Czech Republic and moved en masse in Bavaria but also in Austria.
Once the issue of the nuclear plant resolved, the populist pressure has been tapped in one way, the proposal to repeal the Benes decrees.
The Czech prime minister Milos Zeman quickly demonstrated that it could also play a nationalist card demagoguery.
He described the Sudeten Germans as the "fifth column" Hitler and suggested that Israel could resolve the Palestinian problem using the Czech method of 1945: namely, the deportation.
Edmund Stoiber, the head of government in Bavaria, the candidate of the conservative CDU / CSU for German Chancellor against the current Chancellor Schroeder, and a staunch defender of Sudeten Germans, has demanded that Gerhard Schroeder, cancel a planned visit to Prague in response to the explosive reaction to Zeman.
In order to defuse an election battle with his rival, Schroeder is made.
The fact that Orban has backed the demands of Stoiber was felt as a gift of heaven by the Slovak nationalist Vladimir Meciar in its attempt to become prime minister, because it allowed him to say that his opponents national appeared willing to yield to pressure from the European Union and to Slovakia to compensate the Hungarians expelled by? in 1945.
Meciar has skyrocketed, denouncing the "threat Hungarian, dropping a stroke four years of hard work with the current government of Slovakia to include representatives of ethnic Hungarian minority in the government of Slovakia.
The issues relating to the legal system of post-war Europe go well beyond the former Czechoslovakia.
Erika Steinbach, president of the Association of deported (eastern) and a member of the CDU to Stoiber, argues that the issue of the deportation of German affects the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Slovenians, covering a large part of eastern Europe and Central Europe.
In the 1930s the bête noire of some countries of Central Europe was "the Treaty of Versailles."
It seems today that statements made in 1945 Potsdam and entérinaient the mass expulsion of the German people are the new enemy.
The concern now is that this type of rhetoric can lead to a round of populist victories.
The concern has been damaged when the party Fidesz Viktor Orban lost the recent parliamentary elections in Hungary, but other politicians to be the demagogues resentments national - Vaclav Klaus in Prague, Edmund Stoiber in Germany, Vladimir Meciar Slovakia - still consider nationalism as a vote-winner, despite the defeat of Orban.
Given that they are linked to the sceptics who oppose the European Union such as Berlusconi in Italy and the coalition schüssel-haider in Austria, the true nature of the European political risk must be unpleasant.
Since its creation, the European Union has sought to move beyond the old disputes and, through the cooperation, to build a better future.
Today, some politicians want to take advantage of the desire of Eastern Europe to use of historical issues in their political advantage.
Such a situation brings two fatal consequences: first, there is no more advantageous to return some parts of public opinion of candidate countries against the European Union to allow the populist local portraying the Union as an agent of spread of the German power.
A European Union must represent a way to balance the asymmetric relationship that exists between the countries of Eastern Europe and Germany.
It is possible that she is perceived as an indication of this asymmetry.
The second concern is that while NATO and the European Union is widening, these debates unpleasant might contaminate relations within the international bodies.
This fear may be one reason why President Bush has refused to meet recently Prime Minister Orban, and it is frequently question if Orban spoke as he is now before the entry of Hungary in NATO, the candidacy of his country would have been rejected.
What could disrupt this process?
After 1945, Western Europe has engaged in discussions painful on the history, which contributed to Franco-German reconciliation.
The notions of "collective guilt" have been dismissed as having no basis in a unified Europe and unifiante.
President Vaclav Havel is boldly stated during his first trip to Germany in January 1990, but his comments were interpreted wrong for weakness.
The approach of the expansion of the European Union, the mission of Europe should not be contaminated by supporters of the idea that politicians of the old ‘ other ’ central Europe prefer to indulge in the past rather than thinking responsibly to build a peaceful and prosperous Europe.

Memory and oversight of Zhao Ziyang
So the former Chinese leader and Communist Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang has finally died.
The political choices that he had épousés during term are dead for a long time: the May 19, 1989, when he appeared on the Tiananmen Square just before dawn to beg, tears in the eyes, and apologize to the demonstrators.
"I am truly sorry," he said the spectators.
"I arrived too late."
After that, it has more embodied a fantasy history that a real person.
When his appearance as strange and unexpected on the place was broadcast on the Chinese central television station in the morning after at one of these days of media coverage without censure across China, the public was surprised by this time the transience of official concern, and all too human.
After all, party leaders have rarely their personal feelings in public, even less when it comes to undermine the party line so shamelessly Zhao did.
Such a individualism is either leninism proscriptions or the traditional Chinese behavior for the senior official.
While the crackdown that followed those weeks grisantes freedom of expression and assembly had reached its height apocalyptic during the night of 3 to 4 June, Zhao was plagued by snapped up by the hole in memory of the party where so many other leaders had finished for the socialist "liberation" of China.
The shadow of the democratic world, there was virtually no head of État to protest in defence of Zhao, asking only account for her incarceration illegal and immoral.
Instead, the lives of Zhao was held in abeyance, under house arrest if conveniently forgotten as a kind of fame in cryogénie, frozen, without any hope of resurrection.
Zhao was not murdered, but simply allowed to live in an old house pékinoise with his family.
He was allowed to emerge from time to time, but under right guard as an animal of wealth, to go to the bathroom or play alone in golf, one of the demonstrations of the "bourgeois liberalization" that its efforts of economic reform had to come into China, once sealed shut down.
The Chinese use long since the death of leaders robbed as an opportunity to show their feelings, which can no longer speak through a political process.
During the winter of 1976, when the leader Zhou Enlai (seen as a liberal in the hierarchy Maoists) dead, tens of thousands of people spontaneously invaded the Tiananmen Square, offering the party when a great fear.
It was, of course, the death of former party leader, Hu Yaobang, a liberal of the calibre of Zhao, who launched the protests of 1989.
It is not certain that fans of Zhao is expressed in the same way.
The events of 1989 are very sensitive and Tiananmen Square is so guarded that it is hard to imagine that it may soon be produce any demonstration.
Meanwhile, China seems if hung in the affairs of our days that it is hard to imagine the crowds marching to a cause which adds nothing to their line of total.
It is as if the Communist Party had returned to Marx and replaced the religion with the benefits in the role of the new "opium masses."
Few people outside the poorer classes of workers without jobs and farmers dispossessed appear to have the taste of the protest.
However, Zhao embodied a chapter in Chinese history in which to stand as a reformer meant not only the economy but also all aspects of daily life.
Before becoming leader and party leader, he made the experience of many areas such as the collectivisation of agriculture or the separation of the party of the business world, until the laws guaranteeing the rights of journalists and greater openness to the external world for ordinary people.
It was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than the Maoist dress when a visit abroad and the first to participate in press conferences.
Although Zhao was not a visionary, nor a Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa, and not even anti-communist, its programme in the mid-1980s was addressed to the world economic, political, cultural, media and social and it led to one of the Times the richest and most open on the intellectual level of Chinese history.
It was a tragic paradox that the political movement had peacefully swept across China in 1989 to stop the process of reform and an evolutionary which Zhao had dedicated his life.
The party's leadership was so assagie by the trauma of 4 June that over the years, it was difficult to determine if the reform would survive.
Then, in 1992, Deng Xiaoping set in motion a marchéisations society the fastest and most comprehensive in history, catalyst for the dramatic rise of China turned into an economic superpower.
The death of Zhao Ziyang reminds us of not only that he was treated unfairly, but also how Chinese reforms have been uneven.
For the "miracle" Chinese really becomes a miracle, party leaders ought to study the legacy of a man that they are now eager to throw into oblivion.

The real risks of deficits
The deficits are back, and they want revenge.
The budget deficit in the US government now stands at $455 billion, or 4.1% of GDP.
Two years earlier, the US had predicted a budget surplus for many years.
Although slightly less affected than the US, other rich countries are sinking in the budget deficit.
The European Commission estimates that the deficit in the French government will reach 3.7% of GDP this year, compared to 3.4% in Germany; these figures go well beyond the ceiling of the deficit (3% of GDP) set by the stability and growth of the euro zone.
In the deficit, a country is increasing its national debt and imposes a burden on future generations.
Of course politicians prefer to hide the way out the movements of wealth between the generations.
They are in priority to resolve the immediate problems and now the benefits promised.
The accountants who calculate the deficits of the governments are trying to prevent politicians to fool us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding what will be the costs of future.
But these accounting we offer no method of determining when deficits are justifiable and when they are not.
The deficits are not only political problems, but also issues of fairness between the generations and risk-sharing Inter generations.
No generation should not be obliged to accept the economic risks unnecessary imposed by another generation.
The possibility that deficits are properly future generations depends on how are designed the system of taxation and spending a government.
Supporters of a deficit of the paint often as a necessary evil to rebuild an economy where confidence crumbles.
Inspired by John Maynard Keynes, they say that deficits restaureront continued confidence before that occurs in a recession or depression.
But it amounts to administer the Prozac to a patient before it becomes suicidal.
Such arguments, although they are entirely legitimate at certain times, have limits.
The public deficits of Japan have created a national debt amounting to 140% of annual GDP without producing a resurgence.
Indeed, the current budget deficits reflect the problems in the long term, which do not correspond to what is in the Keynesian theory.
The debates on deficits must be redefined in terms of problems Inter generations important over the long term.
The problems are fine because they depend on the actions of governments to come.
In the past, some governments, when they were faced with huge national debts, "dégonflaient" effectively.
They have removed the burden on the next generation that is returned to investors who have not withdrawn from the bond market in the first signs of rising prices or who have delayed the purchase of their homes, while inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgage-backed securities.
The governments might decide to act in this direction, particularly if the national debt believe more.
The resurgence of a massive inflation may seem unthinkable in the current environment, but do not forget that even an annual inflation rate of 6% of relatively modest decreases the real value of debt to a nation in a little more than 6 ½ years.
It is possible that a public opposition continues to a gradual increase in inflation does not stand up long.
Some politicians can once again to anchor the idea that inflation, is challenging, is a blessing for the economy.
But in addition to deficits officially measured the current governments, there is also certain obligations that are caused by demographic change (falling birth rate) and with the prospect of sums for social security benefits in the future.
The scope of these bonds is monumental.
In a 2003 report, the administrators of the US social security administration trust funds believe that maintaining the solvency of Social Security system for 75 years will cost $3.5 trillion, roughly the amount of debt current total of the US government (3.9 trillion).
The administrators of the US Medicare trust funds (which provides medical services to pensioners) believe their floating bonds are now 5.9 trillion, more than half of the national debt official of America.
The possibility of a budget shortfall in Social Security and health is far worse in Europe and Japan because of demographic statistics much more difficult.
Moreover, unlike the official national debt obligations in terms of social services are not linked to the currency.
They are rather the promise of a certain level of life (including the value of medical services), adjusted for inflation.
No government can ‘ down ’.
But that does not mean that pensions and other social obligations to be completely reformed.
This means that the problem is political.
Pensioners are among the most powerful lobby groups in a democracy and politicians are reluctant to confront them on an issue if essential.
We have yet to face firmly to the problems Inter generations that lie at the heart of current economic dilemmas.
Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a "generational" accounting ensures that the economic risk is systematically divided between the generations.
This means that the bodies of pensions and tax must be designed to take more account of the changing circumstances facing the different generations, rather than making promises of business, which will certainly not be held anyway, some recovery in the future.
For example, when the demographic trends or economic hardship incessant impose charges on the workers at the level of social benefits, the benefits due to pensioners should automatically be modified by increasing the retirement age and / or by the adjustment of profits.
These adjustments will probably in the decades following, but only after a long gap and with several injustices.
We need a system just from the outset to manage the risks which cover several generations of rational way.
These problems can be resolved today, when the economic downturn in most of the advanced countries leads the majority of politicians to focus on the results on the short term?
Hard times, as the Great Depression, have allowed us to introduce changes ".
Under effective leadership (which seems sadly lacking), the more temperate today could lead a public discussion about the methods the most appropriate to share the risks Inter generations.

Say no to Bush
It did three years ago that US President has a unilateral programme, refusing all evidence from contradict his positions and ignores the fundamental American principles and historic.
Take the example of global warming.
In this area, Bush is conspicuous by its absence without permission (AWOL in American military jargon).
Now, it calls into question the science.
(You know, of course, that the academic performance of Bush never struck anyone).
The position of Bush is bad: it puts us in embarrassment.
In fact, when Bush asked the National Academy of Sciences us to examine the issue, the verdict was spectacular: the greenhouse gases pose a serious threat (that is the only verdict that they could produce).
But the American car manufacturers love their cars that consume a lot of petrol and the friends of Bush for the oil industry will accept no interference in their destruction of the Earth's atmosphere.
So we changed the environmental policies.
In Iraq, Bush has once again went a one-way, explaining that it had evidence of ties to Saddam with Al Qaeda and that he possessed weapons of mass destruction.
Even before the American invasion, there was overwhelming evidence proving that Bush was lying.
The technology for detecting had clearly shown that Iraq had no weapon, as the leader of the United Nations inspectors, Hans Blix, pointed out.
It is possible that Bush has read these reports, but they exceeded its intellectual capacities for understanding.
It is also possible that he was not believed what he read.
Nevertheless, American politics was not based on scientific evidence.
Since the end of the cold war, America is the only global superpower.
However, it has failed to exert the kind of power to create a new world order based on principles such as equity.
Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this failure, but they do not vote at the US elections.
Even so, the world is not without appeal.
The rest of the world should simply oppose Bush and his
America has not won the hearts and minds of Iraqis, but instead has lost, just as it has lost the hearts and minds of many peoples.
The États-unis want to retain control of the occupation, but also want others to take the bullets that today are decimating American troops.
The United Nations forces do not have to bear the consequences of the inability to manage the occupation and therefore the calls for financial aid that the États-unis should remain unanswered.
What support the American programme can draw when we see that President Bush has provided hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts to the richest people in the world?
There is not so long, the Republican Congress held the sum of $1 billion that it should the United Nations and threatened not to pay what he was only on condition that the United nations meet in a package of measures.
The lack of willingness to America to finance a weak hand peace contrasts strongly with the fantastic that Congress promised quick in the war effort.
Supporters of a moderate approach say that if the United Nations does not mean it will be their death. By participating in the Iraqi occupation, it will restore the confidence of États-unis so that the next incidence of this sort, America will turn more quickly in the United Nations.
It is absurd.
The occupants of the White House now firmly believe in the
I am usually is economics, not policy.
However, at a time of globalization in this new world, economic interdependence is stronger, and requires action, regulations and the institutions more collective, as well as a rule of law.
The economic globalization, however, has exceeded the global political and decision-making processes are far from democratic and transparent.
In many cases, we can establish that the failures of globalisation goes back to the same spirit behind the failure of the Iraqi occupation: the pluralist institutions should not serve the interests of one country but for all countries.
During the recent summit of World Trade Organization (WTO) - which took place in Cancun, developing countries have indicated to America and Europe, that this system could not continue.
In this case, Europe is just as guilty as America.
Europe has no difficulty to see the dangers of unilateralism of US stocks, since the withdrawal of Kyoto until his refusal to participate in the International Criminal Court.
But Europe should also reflect on its own practices, including its policies on trade, especially when the EU is systematically destroying the regime of international trade rigged the developing countries, despite promises to restore the balance with talks ongoing.
There, Europe is behaving like America, which has long since passed the rhetoric of free trade, while its actions, not long ago the principles.
Forgotten the American rhetoric on justice and fairness, in trade negotiations, the États-unis ignore the call of the world's poorest countries to end the cotton subsidies that have so devastating for them.
If we must do a world more politically safe and more economically stable and prosperous, globalisation will have to stand at the level of economic globalization.
The principles of democracy, social justice, social solidarity and the rule of law should be extended beyond national borders.
Europe and the rest of the world will have to do their homework: these principles themselves and push each other, and America, in the right direction.

The real price of the Iraq war
In life, the most important things, like life itself, has no price.
But that does not mean that the issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), as the defence, should not be screened for economic analysis of the cold and rigorous.
Shortly before the Iraq war, when Larry Lindsey, the economist of the Bush administration, has suggested that the costs could be between 100 and 200 billion dollars, other officials have quickly raised objections.
For example, the director of Budget and Management, Mitch Daniels, thought about him, this figure to $60 billion.
It is today that the estimates of Lindsey were grossly underestimated.
Concerned that the Bush administration can be fooled everyone on the cost of the Iraq war, as it has already done on weapons of mass destruction and its links with Al Qaeda, I agree with Linda Bilmes, of the budget expert at Harvard, to address the problem.
Even we who are opposed to war, have been appalled by what we have discovered: Our estimates of low to moderate, vary slightly less of a trillion dollars to more than 2 trillion.
Our analysis begins with the $500 billion, which speaks openly about the Congressional Budget Office, which is ten times higher than what had announced the administration over the cost of war.
His estimate is wrong at this point because the figures do not even understand all the costs for the government.
And the budgetary costs are only a fraction of the costs of the whole economy.
The Bush administration has, for example, done everything she could to hide the large number of veterans who have seriously injured: 16 thousand for the moment, which more or less than 20% suffering serious injuries to the brain and the head.
Not surprising that its figure of $500 billion ignores the failures and the costs of health for the lives that the government will have to pay over the coming years.
The administration does not confront the problems of military recruitment and retention of troops.
The result is the payment of bonuses to those who commit to new, more benefits and costs of recruitment higher: an increase of 20% between 2003 and 2005.
In addition, war is using the equipment, which will replace part.
The budgetary costs (without taking into account the interests) stood at $652 billion for our estimates the more modest and 799 billion dollars for our estimates moderate.
We can assume that as the government did not cut other expenses, or increased taxes, these costs were financed by debt, and the cost to the interests of this debt would add to 98 other billions of dollars (estimate) to 385 billion dollars (moderate) to the budgetary costs.
Of course, the heavy burden of injuries and deaths is borne by the soldiers and their families.
But the army pays benefits of disability are well below the value of lost income.
Similarly, the sums paid for soldiers killed only amount to 500,000 dollars, which is well below the estimates standards of the economic cost of a death on a life, which are sometimes under the name of statistical value of a life (6.1 to 6.5 million dollars).
But the costs do not stop there.
The Bush administration once proclaimed that the war in Iraq would be good for the economy, and a spokesman has even suggested that it was the best way to ensure the low oil prices.
As is often the case, things were very different: the oil companies are the big winners, and the American and global economies have lost.
But extremely modest, we believe the effect on the economy if only 5 or $10 increase are attributed to the war.
In the same time, money earmarked for the war could be spent on something else.
We believe that if part of this money was invested in roads, schools and in research, the US economy would have been more stimulated short-term and its growth would have been better long term.
There is a number of other costs, some potentially important, which are very difficult to quantify.
For example, Americans pay each year, $300 billion for the "option value '(potential value) of their state of military preparation, which allows them to be prepared to fight where necessary.
The fact that Americans are ready to pay it suggests that the potential value is superior to costs.
But there is little doubt that it has been greatly diminished and will remain for several years.
In short, even our estimate "moderate" can significantly underestimated the cost of American engagement in Iraq.
And our estimate does not include any costs involved in the huge losses and valuables in Iraq.
We are not trying to explain that the American people has been deliberately misled about the costs of war, or that the gross underestimation of the Bush administration must be put on the account of incompetence, as it is strongly in the case of weapons of mass destruction.
We are not in the process of trying to judge if there was more profitable to make war.
Recent evidence that the number of deaths and injuries would have been considerably reduced if we had done better physical protection to soldiers show how the economies in the short term can lead to long-term costs.
It is undeniable that when the programming of a war is a matter of choice, as was the case here, an inadequate preparation is even less justifiable.
But such considerations appear to be out of reach the calculations of the Bush administration.
The analysis made of the costs and benefits of major projects have been routine, the Defense Department and other departments for nearly a half-century.
The war in Iraq was a huge "project" and yet it appears today that the analysis of its profits was very wrong and that of its costs virtually nonexistent.
One cannot help wondering: y-avait-il other ways to spend a fraction of 1 to 2 trillion of the war in projects that would have better heightened security increased prosperity and promoted democracy?

The freedom it is not enough?
Democracies have need of values?
This seems absurd to view photographs of American soldiers torturing their and humiliating Iraqi prisoners.
The fact is that the progress of democracy have gone hand-in-hand with an erosion of common values and the preponderance of individual autonomy.
It requires the agnosticisme moral and a plurality of references, as neither devoted and compulsory.
Democracy is cultivating certainly values, but they are generally more liberal - in other words individual rights are not on the collective.
For all the Democrats today, the more complete autonomy of the individual remains, as was the Thomas Jefferson, "clear".
However, human rights, civil and political rights are sufficient to make the strength and the survival of democracies?
Modern democracies are transparent enough to muster the energy - including the sacrifice for granted - needed to defeat their enemies?
For a long time, these issues have not presented any emergency, in part because the core values of democracy were less abstract than they appear now.
These values have fuelled the fight against totalitarianism Nazi and Soviet, fascism, and the military dictatorship. In their name, minorities have been recognizing the rights to the equality and dignity, Decolonization was conducted.
The Democratic values are perhaps partisan in defence of human rights, but it gives them a universality that justified the struggle against oppression wherever it occurs.
However, in the more advanced countries, the promises of material prosperity made possible thanks to the freedom has replaced long overdue attention to democratic values and their defence as cement.
Westerners are not rushing to copy the freedom fighters who gave birth to their society, despite the commemorations, the scene of memory and the persistence of oppression.
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 against the US has changed all this - not only international relations but also the balance between the rights and obligations that we see for a long time for granted.
In fact, the collapse of the twin towers, which was a surprising event in its terms, its symbolism and its scale, nothing has changed.
In itself, it does not reveal that the urgency of a fundamental reassessment long overdue.
That is really our Western model of democratic development?
Some systems of democratic values not to cause more, because they are based on community solidarity, religion or the nation, because the companies closed cause less exhaust, doubt and the distance, criticism or frivolous that open societies.
Beyond the basic freedoms and our economic and social system, we have a society that is specific to defend?
Our civilisation would prefer to companies that accept the selfishness compared to his family and his group, which tolerates few reserves under the "Bachelor" in terms of mores, who consider the blasphemy, criticism of power and even civil disobedience are of fundamental freedoms.
Better still apply companies like ours with problems such as drugs, prostitution, alcoholism, such acts of vandalism, a mullah regime or troops, because these social problems can be dissipated, if not totally destroyed, without changing their foundations.
What is not true of totalitarian regimes or fundamentalists who must be destroyed to create a free societies.
But that can respond to all kinds of fundamentalists who see the most determined fighters are on their side, if our civilization is to be protected?
Can you say something other than the individual freedoms?
Two temptations contrary to our principles must be exposed.
The first is the return to the values say 'traditional' own companies fearful: It not only would mean the withdrawal and the closure but sometimes hatred.
The second temptation is a modern variant of the gunboat diplomacy, which focuses on physical strength without regard for the projection of a credibility and legitimacy.
When the enemy we attack, we certainly need to respond immediately without too much to ask questions.
If the enemy we face, it is better to assert its legitimacy, thus gaining credibility, internal and external first then.
We must not that there is too large a gap between the statement of principles and the reality of our behaviour.
The values can no longer, either, as before, born of the sky, nature, the reason or a law of history.
Our values must take shape in and by the Democratic debate, and our defence must be three areas that you cannot separate.
We have increasingly need to update our social pact.
France has tried to do with the debate that she has begun, and reached by a law on secularism, a company important even if it could be better and better to do the link between the principles, the social realities and anthropological and major policies.
Such a debate should also apply to school, its rules, its goals and content that it should convey.
Note, however, that in many countries, political parties are finding it difficult to engage in such discussions.
The second major line of such an action of re-creation of values is what I call the constitution social and fiscal Society, which it will add the environmental rules.
The so-called "community", the issues related to the gap fortunes, the legitimacy of inequality, the definition of Justice, the redistribution, etc. will come with a force in the political debate.
This debate has not taken place in the United States, despite the fickleness of the beginning of the Clinton era; he has had an answer in the UK and Germany with the third way of Blair and the variant that has given Schröder.
In France, it has stagnated because of the strength of conflicts of distribution, too strong division of the left and the lack of vision of social and economic right.
Are the values of new world order: of course, a prerequisite for such values is an example and not of values "red" linked to the crisis management or disputes.
We must also take care that short-term interests do not harm targets more fundamental long-term.
The fight in defence of democracy cannot be selective.
A certain vision desirable for the future of the world must appeal to shared the views of justice and fairness.
We must all be freedom fighters.

The last hope for Venezuela in the elections.
Venezuela is paralysed in a dangerous impasse.
President Hugo Chávez is clinging to power despite the failure of his government marked by a serious deterioration in economic and political polarisation dangerous.
The opposition, dented by a coup d État missed in April 2002, is now seeking to force Mr Chávez to resign by the organisation of a general strike very expensive.
Each part justifies his intransigence with arguments biased.
Its supporters glorify Mr Chávez as a champion of poor besieged by an elite selfish and comploteuse.
His opponents are the most ferocious Mr Chávez as an autocrat, a Cuban revolution at the ready to destroy democracy.
These two points of view are questionable.
The government Chávez was not helpful to the poorer classes of Venezuela.
Instead, its belligerent rhetoric and governance irrational have scared investors, causing an economic downturn and rising unemployment and poverty.
Today Mr Chávez no longer enjoys the support of the majority of poor.
The opposition is formed the bulk of civil society of Venezuela: the business world, but also the unions, professional associations and NGOs.
And the polarization in place in Venezuela does not offer the "poor" to "oligarchs" but a populist civil society.
The opinion of the opposition, that share the right wing of the Bush administration, is also unconvincing.
Rather than to start a revolution, Mr Chávez did hymn-sheet an overheated rhetoric.
While his qualities of Democrat are dubious, it has never
But the insistence of Mr Chávez about the sanctity of the Constitution is hypocritical.
Four years earlier, Mr Chávez is separate from the old constitution using a plebiscite to create a new, tailor-made for him.
Today he invokes the charter for rejecting calls for a plebiscite on the continuation of its mandate.
The paradox here is that Mr Chávez gave the example as to what could be the solution to the impasse today.
Since Mr Chávez used the means paraconstitutionnels to promote its desire for change in 1999, that the international community is not confined to the constitution in force to resolve this crisis plaguing the nation.
In fact, the Latin American members of the group of nations "friends" who are trying to play the mediators in this conflict can take inspiration from an interesting experience for such a solution.
After all, such confrontations are not extraordinary presidential systems for the rigid in Latin America.
When the heads of government, elected for fixed terms do not enjoy any political support, they cannot be robbed by a censure motion as it exists in the parliamentary systems.
Presidential systems can be long conflicts that pose a threat to democracy, as is the case in Venezuela.
However, during the last decade, Latin American politicians have given more flexibility from the presidential systems in innovative in the dismissal of Presidents without popular support.
One of the discredited predecessor Mr Chávez was removed from office following accusations little serious crime commission, the parliament of the Équateur declared a disaster "hit" of mental incapacity, Peru, a president autocrat who was forced into exile after months of international pressure and local.
When politicians are interpreting the law with a dose of creativity in these circumstances, they usually do to ensure the survival of fragile democracies in crisis.
While these tactics are contained and do not become ammunition easier for the opposition, they act as a safety valve for the presidential systems.
An international agreement can also serve as a safeguard against frivolous such mechanisms.
Hope that the group of nations friends can help to create innovative solutions in the case of Venezuela.
To be accepted by both parties, such a solution can only respond to the wishes of both parties.
The opposition would prefer a vote "all or nothing" about the pursuit of Mr Chávez, a vote that it will be likely, but that Mr Chávez would probably never.
Mr Chávez insists on the referendum mechanism for availability under its constitution, what the opposition can tolerate: Get rid it of the president would require many more votes than those raised by Mr Chávez in the last elections.
And the increase of abstention makes it quasi-impossible.
None of the two proposals is politically possible.
Only a democratic solution to the conflict that would not predict the outcome of the consultation is likely to be adopted.
This mechanism, it is holding elections, the faster this summer is the most realistic).
Each side will have to work hard to win the victory.
The opposition, tense, will have to go beyond the rejection of Mr Chávez; it will have to draft a plan for rebuilding the country and unite to support a candidate attractive.
President Chávez will have to clarify the content and meaning of his "Bolivarian revolution."
As Mr Chávez is a clever politician and the opposition remains divided, it will have chances to win, which should make him accept this solution.
The pressures of the group of nations friends could lead to each party to accept this last chance to avoid a crash.
The elections can be legitimised by a constitutional amendment to reduce the presidential term, as proposed by Jimmy Carter in his recent efforts to mediate.
Since it is thought to defuse a crisis of exceptional, it would not create a precedent that would encourage frivolous attacks against the democratically elected governments in Latin America.
The organisation of elections in Venezuela today would save democracy but do not undermine.

The dangerous links to Syria
All eyes are trained in Syria since the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
The Lebanese opposition groups, as supporters of Hariri, openly accusing the regime of Syrian President Bashir Assad, to be responsible for this killing.
The Bush administration, without formally accuse Syria, is not far from doing the same thing, and has recalled its ambassador in Damascus.
It said the États-unis very angry with Syria and its refusal to withdraw its troops from Lebanon as required under a UN resolution.
The growing opposition against the Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is one of four similar problems which Syria must face and she has treated inappropriately.
The three other problems are the actions of Syria, Iraq, its relations with the États-unis and the need for domestic reforms.
While the corrosive immobility is one of the characteristics of the Syrian regime, these challenges are threatening to reinforce each other and marginalize Syria even more than it already is internationally.
In Lebanon, the Syrians have been underestimating the intentions of the Bush administration.
In September, the États-unis, with the support of France, have supported the resolution 1559 UN Security Council demanding the withdrawal of Syrian troops and disarming the militias, and Hezbollah.
It happened after the extension unconstitutional mandate of the Lebanese president, Émile Lahoud, despite warnings from French and American, forced Mr Assad in September.
Until now, however, Syrian officials say privately that they do not believe that the États-unis are serious about the withdrawal.
The Syrian leaders continue to reject requests from Lebanon to end the Syrian military presence in place for 28 years.
These requirements have become louder since the death of Mr Hariri, when tens of thousands of supporters of former prime minister have called for the departure of Syria, when they didn't take position so far on Syria.
Indeed, a broad opposition front multi-community has formed in Beirut to demand the departure of Syria.
However, rather than meet the requirements of the front and create healthy bilateral relations between countries on an equal footing, Syria has sought to divide the opposition to reassert its control.
The Hariri assassination further complicates the situation and Syria must prepare for a strong reaction from France and the États-unis.
In Iraq, since the fall of Baghdad on 9 April 2003, Damascus has shown a misplaced nostalgia for the old system.
Despite the tough opposition that separated the parties baasistes Syria and Iraq, they consolaient both thanks to their membership in a confederation of despots.
For the Syrians, a democratic Iraq and friendly to the États-unis has always been worse than a Saddam Hussein, an enemy that they knew well, and with whom they have done exchanges profitable, when Iraq was the international economic sanctions.
The support of the exiles baasistes Iraqis blamed on Syria threatens to hurt relations with the new Iraq.
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the regime of Mr Assad to drive the Iraqi funds sent to the insurgents and has recently informed the Syrians to the discovery of a photograph showing a senior Syrian espionage in the company of an Islamist fighter, photographs found on the body to Fallujah.
Following the elections, a legitimate power is emerging in Iraq and the Syrians should show foresight in getting rid of their friends supporting Saddam.
The Bush administration's growing impatience with the Syrian involvement in the Iraqi rebellion is one of the main reasons the deterioration of relations between the États-unis and Syria.
Indeed, disdain for Washington to Syria.
This is why the denials of Syria's destructive role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously and that is why Mr Assad has no American support for the resumption of negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights.
There are signs that the Syrians are unable to measure the US intentions on other issues.
Mr Assad, for example, still does not understand, apparently, how the Bush administration with his regime to terrorism.
Syrian officials believe that the secular Baath party to guarantee the unwavering support of États-unis against the resurgent Islamist.
They do not understand that American officials believe Syria as complicit in the activities of the Islamic terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories in Iraq and Lebanon.
At home, the regime of Mr Assad has also found some difficulties.
The political and economic reforms will argue that small, when they argue.
One of the main elements of discussion in Syria is the rebirth of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system which offers little encouragement, except in cases of the major characters of the regime.
The opposition from France to the Syrian presence in Lebanon was partly the result of his disenchantment with the reformist ambitions of Mr Assad and the European Union has expressed similar reservations.
Mr Assad between now in phase of consolidation, which leaves little room for reforms.
Indeed, its new Interior Minister Ghazi Kanaan, the hardliner belonging to the old school, led a crackdown against the reformers and the Kurds during the past year.
The reshuffle last November, which brought to power Kanaan and other was regarded as a reflection of the preferences of Mr Assad.
In the coming months, several rounds of retirement should allow the president to put its pawns in positions of responsibility.
The consolidation, however, is no reform.
Mr Assad will have to show that his authority strengthened can lead to a true transformation.
Until now, the president has taken a hard line toward Iraq, Lebanon and the internal affairs.
Is it really is a reformer, it has not convinced great world.
Syria may have to pay dearly for this ambiguity.

The House racially divided Europe
The extreme right is characterised by his racism and its use of the immigration issue as the difference.
Northern League in Italy, Vlaams Blok Holland, supporters of the National Front of Le Pen in France, are all examples of parties or movements trained on the subject during the aversion to immigrants and the promotion of policies simplistic to monitor them.
While individuals such as Jorg Haidar and Jean-Marie Le Pen can go and (never too early), the issue of race will never be the European policy in the near future.
An ageing population and the borders of increasingly open imply a fragmentation of race growing in European countries.
The main parties of the centre left and centre right have faced the prospect in the sand, hoping against all expectations that the problem would disappear.
This is not the case, as clearly demonstrates the history of race in America.
The race relations in the United States grabbed for decades - and have always - as in politics, to the point that the racial divisions are as important as income, if not more, as a key determinants of preferences and political posturing.
The first step to address the issue of racial politics is to understand the causes and consequences of the racial animosity, even if it means the discovery of unpleasant truths.
This is precisely the purpose in large part by research teams in economics, sociology, psychology and in political science in the United States.
This research shows that representatives of various races are far less confidence with each other; whites are less inclined to support social welfare spending, according to them, the minorities; communities more fragmented racialement have governments less effective, of corruption and influence more important, crime rates higher and less productive public assets per dollar.
This does not mean eliminating the disparity and create communities racialement homogenous, but it is necessary to acknowledge the reality of these problems in order to begin to develop a strong public policies on race relations.
Of course, Americans are contesting the methods to use.
Some argue in favour of action plans that offer to minorities affirmatifs preferences in the allocation of employment, admission to university and the public contracts.
These policies are seen as a way to provide compensation for past injustices and, more important, creating the role models and overcome the remaining discrimination and probably unintentional.
Others are protesting against affirmative action and support a policy that will not be concerned about race, with free market policies and values pro family, is enough to create jobs for minorities and to help not to separate the black families.
This is crucial in any policy as one of the most important causes of poverty in the US is the spread of parents (see single mother) in the black community.
Whatever the right answer the question is the determination of the measures on the race is a dominant issue in American politics.
Of course, minorities have moved towards greater integration and economic success.
In the 1950s, blacks are not allowed to sit in the front of buses, two of the main players in American foreign policy are black.
We cannot deny that the American right-wing politicians continue to deploy the 'race card "as a tool tactics.
Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, the former assistant of Nixon and Reagan, who has been independent presidential candidate in the last election.
It has recently published a book to success, entitled "The death of the West: how dying people and immigrant invasion imperil our country and civilization."
But for every pound like this, there are 10 others who pose a serious analysis of the issue of race in America.
The analysis and the political debate on race relations have a considerable delay in Europe.
At most, the question is carefully considered in terms of immigration quotas and restrictions on borders, not in terms of opportunity and social problems created by an increasingly mixed racialement.
Of course, an immigration policy clear is required to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants.
But it is not enough: the controls of borders Mexico does not mean the end of American policy on the domestic problems of race.
Europe is rich and its rapidly aging population: Europeans, reinforced by generous social welfare programmes, are not prepared to accept "dirty", say, in agriculture and industry leather.
This makes it inevitable increased immigration.
The Europeans, however, are quick to criticise the US for the failures of their policy towards minorities and for any manifestation of racism in the Atlantic.
The reading of the European press is often a complex of superiority to the US on the racial issues: they (Americans) have problems with racism; we are immune to him, except the neo-Nazi skinheads mad and their counterparts.
What happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, demonstrates that the racial problem in Europe is more profound and, as the United States, is about the sad truth that the race relations are inherently difficult and that confidence and a cooperative behaviour do not travel well on the racial lines.
If the mainstream parties in Europe have not taken more seriously to understand the racial tensions that exist in their country and putting the "race" at the centre of their priorities, individuals such as Le Pen try always to try to fill the gap with their message of hate.
To combat the French exception
The attention of Europe today is a tour and with regard to enlargement and the Constitution under negotiation between the États states.
However, the result of several spats Gallic with the European Commission will not be less important to determine the fate of the new enlarged Europe.
France has decided unilaterally to ignore the stability and growth in leaving to run its public deficit beyond the limit of 3% of GDP.
The French love to talk about the severity of their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is no longer and confusion because its entry.
France became part of the main criticisms of Ireland when, in 2000, the Irish government undercut his budget surplus, which was at 4%, a mere 0.5%.
Other countries have not complied with the stability pact, but France is the first country to do so with a small smile satisfied openly contemptuous.
None of this should not surprise.
France does apply to the European regulations typically very well anchored to consider its own culture as an exception.
Thus, France opposed systematically veto any reform of the European Union's common agricultural policy.
As everyone knows, the cap is a fine gift offered to the rich European farmers (particularly farmers French) who do not deserve it, at the expense of farmers in developing countries and European consumers.
France is also trying to go back to the old policies of bailing out the private companies in deficit and collapsed in a stream of public money.
The European commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, cannot lose this battle: it needs the support of those who have faith in markets and equal treatment for all.
The story is simple.
The French government plans to bail out Alstom, a company that has developed high-technology products, including the TGV, the French high-speed train, but who recently is bankrupt.
The French government claims that he never abandon its rescue plan for Alstom, a plan that has all the usual dirigisme: maintaining employment, protection of investors, etc.
Moreover, since Alstom is a high-tech company, the French government plays the map of research and development, arguing that investment in R &amp; D is beneficial to growth.
Save Alstom's business is clearly a mistake.
The company is formed of different units, some benefit, others in bankruptcy, it clearly needs to dismantle it.
The profitable units, such as the TGV, will easily buyer, the loss-making units should be closed.
The taxpayers' money in France will be better spent in the cost temporary retraining of workers rather than to keep alive a company that is not profitable.
It is important for the European Commission does not allow France to carve out of the laws on measure for itself in the policies on competition, as it seems to be doing with budget deficits.
The commission should condemn the public financing of private companies in France as it condemns the subsidies in any other European État member.
The commission has already achieved some success there, especially in forcing Germany to cancel the government guarantees of state-owned banks.
Alstom, in particular and France in general should not make an exception and must meet the same standards.
If the Commission does not act, the European Union will even more in a playground for the French officials.
France has already taken the lead in the European Union foreign policy with its foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, and looks more and more to a foreign minister for Europe.
Meanwhile, France ignores the basic rules of common economic policy and government support for private companies.
The European Commission it will lose the credibility that it has to end up looking like a Parisian district of lesser importance?
On the issue of Alstom would have serious repercussions in Europe and not just for the policies on competition.

The war for oil
For decades, both Republicans than Democrats are pursuing the same objectives: to keep oil to the stability of the price of oil, reduce soft domestic consumption, reduce the dependence on imports and diversify the sources of supply.
Despite appearances, these goals are always the same today, under the Bush administration.
Many observers believe that with the invasion of Iraq, Bush has chosen a different path.
A significant increase in production in Iraq would probably dependence on oil from the USA.
The price of oil will no doubt with the emergence of a new source of supply, where a reliance on us, particularly in relation to the Middle East.
It is a paradox that the US more control of Iraqi oil under the program "food against oil" of the UN before the war (it was the UN and not Saddam Hussein that set the level of Iraqi exports) that they cannot do so in the context of a future Iraqi state Democratic.
If the Bush administration sought the sources of supply tanker stable, secure, diversified and cheap, it was enough to lift the embargo imposed on Libya, Iran, Iraq and Sudan and leave the oil.
But the interests of America for the Iraqi oil is not dictated by the economy or the energy policy.
The Bush administration has acknowledged that Iraqi oil is primarily a geopolitical asset.
Who controls the Iraqi oil, Iraq.
Saddam had its power to the fact he controlled the second world reserve of oil.
He knew perfectly well what it should to the black gold.
Facing the possibility of the invasion and the defeat, it has threatened to set fire to Iraqi oil fields.
The destruction and looting of Iraq's oil and gas pipelines shows that almost everyone understood that control the oil is controlling the country.
In the run-up to the invasion by the United States, securing the oil fields was a priority.
The aim was not an increase in supply or lower prices on the American market, but the overthrow of Saddam and his replacement by a new government.
Iraq's future is linked to oil production of the country.
But given the vagaries of the oil market, especially in a situation as volatile, we do not see how the Bush administration will be able to achieve its goals in the coming years.
The problem is simple.
The US should use the oil revenues to ease the financial burden to the Iraqi regime based on American taxpayers.
In the long term, reconstruction plan depends on the ability of Iraq to export volumes of oil.
If Iraq does not produce oil, President Bush cannot keep the promises made to the Iraqi people, the American people and the international community.
Before the invasion, Iraq had a production capacity of three million barrels of oil per day.
But it can return to this level of production in the time allotted to establish an Iraqi government.
An increase of production requires the development of oil installations, which requires large investments, a government in place and political stability.
Nobody, not even the Bush administration, expects that these conditions are met shortly.
The political stability is the precondition to increase production capacity.
The experience of Iran, Kuwait, Russia and even Iraq, shows that it takes around three years of political stability before production capacity can significantly increase and sustainable.
It will take several years in Iraq to develop a new constitution, establish a democratic government to negotiate the distribution of oil revenues between the different regions, regulate investment and making the economy attractive to foreign investors.
It will take time to negotiate with the multinational oil companies and neighbouring countries the achievement of the feasibility studies and technical studies, and reconstruction, the restoration and the exploration of its oil fields.
Also, even a period of 3 years seems optimistic, because it means that during this time the occupation, Iraqis are setting up their own government and an end to political instability.
But the reality may be different.
The serious tensions can persist for years.
And it would not be surprising that the Iraqi oil production is suddenly stop, even with a democratic government.
History shows that the strikes and social unrest that could disrupt oil production are more easily in a democratic framework that under a dictatorship.
If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production within a few years, this will be a thorn in the foot, both for the foreign policy for the Energy Policy of the USA.
How can they be able to finance long-term reconstruction of Iraq?
Who pays for maintaining a fragile democracy in Iraq?
The US to maintain their occupation without providing the Iraqi people, medical care and other basic services?
These are difficult issues, and we cannot answer before a Democratic regime does not control and secure Iraq's oil output.

Leave the killers defend human rights
If it was not so sad, it would be the macabre joke of the Millennium: Libya was elected to lead the United Nations Commission on Human Rights!
When Caligula has appointed his horse in the Senate, the horse, at least, had no blood on its hooves.
Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the presidency changes every year in a region in the world to another.
This year, it was at the tour of Africa to appoint the president and has appointed Libya.
Only the US and Canada have voted against.
To their shame infinite, European countries abstained.
This speaks volumes about the moral bankruptcy of the United Nations that this decision comes at a time so difficult for this organization.
President Bush has defied the United Nations to demonstrate their serious about their own binding decisions on Iraq: Otherwise, they can suffer the same fate shameless that the League of Nations, which proved impotent in the 1930s when she faced the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.
The election of Libya to preside over a United Nations body responsible for upholding human rights currently contributes nothing to support the legitimacy and the moral authority of the global body.
Remember that Libya is a totalitarian tyranny, its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines a behavior sometimes changing to extremists in supporting the dictators of the world.
It leads one of the most oppressive regimes around the world, in which is no pretence of election and where the opposing views are instantly suppressed.
Under his reign, Libya has supported terrorist organizations worldwide, the IRA so many of the Palestinian extremist groups.
It still faces the United Nations sanctions for the role it played in the attack on a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, ten years ago.
Over the last decade, the position of the United Nations as a symbol of the ideals of a global community Pacific has regularly been undermined.
They have proved quite incapable of stopping the war in the Balkans; and in at least one case, Srebrenica, the Dutch forces to the United Nations peacekeeping remained there and have seen the worst massacre of post-war Europe while the Bosnian Serbs massacraient around 6,000 Muslims.
A commission of inquiry by the Netherlands has admitted later that the Dutch battalion of the United Nations was in fact complicit in this war crime.
In Rwanda, when the genocide began, the UN representative in charge of peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of the United Nations forces of the country, leaving the field open to the genocide in the bloodiest since the second world war.
The name of the United Nations representative is Kofi Annan.
It is a past depressing and sad that the United Nations are trying, probably in vain, buying into appearing in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and the international legitimacy.
But at a time when the UN inspections in Iraq are sending the Salvation Army to remove a bunch of gangsters, it may be that the election of Libya as head of the Commission on Human Rights is a historic date, the final collapse of an organisation which had raised a huge hope.
The organizations do not usually die, and certainly, there is too much because of state not to ensure that the United Nations will continue to stand.
But they will not be just a shadow of what they should, and could be.
The United Nations today to give the hypocrisy a bad reputation.

Supporters of the authority are
Last Thursday, the judges of the court of central Jakarta in Indonesia was sentenced to one year in prison.
I am guilty, as editor of Tempo weekly newsmagazine, according to the court, defamation against Tomy Winata, a business tycoon, to have implied his possible involvement in a fire in the market of textiles of Southeast Asia in Jakarta and of instigating the riots in spreading lies.
My case and other similar cases présagent-ils once more the end of a short democratic experiment in Indonesia?
"The riots" that I have incited has occurred in March last year when almost 200 thugs mantle of Winata attacked the offices of pace, threatening to incendier building, hounding the personnel and injuring a journalist.
To try to resolve the situation peacefully, I was sure to go to negotiate the Bureau of central Jakarta police and découvris, horrified, that the leaders of the gang had taken the power to the police station.
I was struck with fists and feet while the police left.
Fortunately, many journalists came to our rescue with magnétophones and cameras to record the events.
The spread of these images and set off the public outcry forced parliament to open a public inquiry.
The leaders of the national police and police in Jakarta were called and, because of strong pressure from public opinion, the leaders of this clique were charged.
However, Winata himself échappa to the police investigation simply declaring publicly that his supporters agirent without informing him without his agreement.
It was itself a complaint against Ahmad Taufik, the author of the article, Teuku Iskandar Ali, the publisher, and myself.
The hearings of the trial which durèrent a year marked by a series of developments suspects, all in favour of Winata.
First, the case brought by the police and the prosecutor contained documents so blatantly false that the police inculpa two officers.
But the court rejected the request to suspend the hearings until the clarification of the legality of the issue of the prosecutor.
The case against the officers involved seems to lead nowhere.
Instead, one of them has been promoted to head the new anti-terror unit of Jakarta, has created (and is funded by the US).
The other has said, was referred back to school for police to receive specialist training.
Then, after six months of hearings, the lead judge panel of three judges was suddenly promoted to head a municipal court at a time of Jakarta.
One of my lawyers noted that in 35 years of practice in court, he had never seen a lead judge be replaced in the case.
In fact, despite its promotion, the judge continued to preside over another case in the same building.
A judge who in the past had ruled against pace during the civil case brought by Winata came to replace it.
Finally, Winata during his testimony, presented false testimony by denying he was interviewed by pace.
A recording of the telephone conversation was broadcast during the hearings, the journalist who made the maintenance and the two authors who assistèrent témoignèrent under oath, the telephone company came official documents attesting to the phone call as evidence of its existence and experts attestèrent that the voice of the recording was one of Tomy Winata.
But the judges rejected the request of tempo demanding the arrest of Winata for it to be tried for false testimony and we conseillèrent of complaint to police, something that we have made.
The judges have rejected the request to defer the decision of the court until the case of false testimony of Mr Winata is judged.
View all of these defects, my conviction and prison sentence, are hardly surprising.
But I am very hopeful of winning in the end when the call of pace will be brought before the bodies.
The higher courts Indonesians are kinder to the ethics and the director of the Supreme Court is a staunch defender of democracy and freedom of expression. The case of jumping could become a decisive step for our democracy, as the famous Supreme Court decision in the United States in the New York Times against Sullivan.
Having met the threshold of tolerance in the accusations against libel, this decision has led to the American press to demand accountability to the leaders of public affairs.
No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of speech and press freedom have tested the indicators of democratic development and that the punishment of journalists is one of the first symptoms of authoritarianism.
Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950s, before the muzzling the press by President Sukarno, helped the military junta in 1956.
Criticism has been stifled, the consolidation of power without against power was easy, and in July 1959, Sukarno could announce the start of the "enlightened" democracy.
During the first few years following the collapse of Sukarno in 1966, all the advantages of real democracy, including freedom of press, were restored (except for the communists).
However, President Suharto's regime has launched in the muzzling the press in the early 1970s by suspending various newspapers and jailing journalists.
The press muzzled, other political rights were quickly violated and the Indonesian democracy was plagued by once more.
Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the first Muslim community Democratic history.
The free, fair and peaceful elections were held by twice for the election of parliament and the direct election of President, including the last presidential election, proving the co-existence between Islam and democracy.
The enemies of democracy is based, however, ever.
Islamic extremist groups have launched in bomb attacks without distinction, while the groups said the authoritarian tendencies have made a breakthrough in the circles of the President Megawati.
But Mrs Megawati has just lost the recent presidential elections.
Susilo, the newly elected president, it will continue to persecute journalists?
My conviction, and the trials and sentences of other journalists, it will mark the beginning of the end of the third Indonesian democracy so hard won?
The answer lies in the support that the activists Indonesian Democrats can generate domestically and internationally.
Indonesia, losing over potential in the hope of all the democracy activists in the Muslim world, would be a terrible defeat.

The moral of the death penalty
Often accused États-unis their refusal to abolish the death penalty.
Many people claim today that the abolition of capital punishment is a necessary condition for a civilised system of criminal law.
The Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker is not.
European governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty -- the European Union banned completely, and some Europeans believe that its use to États-unis is barbaric.
In fact, many European intellectuals think that capital punishment, and any death in general, deterring criminals do not.
But while the Europeans, with crime rates far below those of États-unis during the last century, have long afford some 'soft' most crimes, we have seen their crime rate increased sharply over the past twenty years.
Instead, the American rates have fallen in part thanks to increased use of retribution.
The death penalty.
I am for the implementation of some people accused of murder because, and for that reason alone, I think that prevents other murders.
If I was not convinced I would be opposed to capital punishment for revenge and other possible motives should not be built at a public policy.
Empirical research serious on the death penalty in the États-unis began with a study of Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in the American Economic Review.
Some studies have sometimes found a deterrent effect of lower, others much more powerful.
However, the information available are quite limited, it should not be based its conclusions solely on the econometric evidence.
Évidemment, public policy in terms of punishment can hope for perfect evidence.
But even with the limited quantitative evidence available, the good reasons to believe the deterrent power of the death penalty are sufficient.
Most people, and the killers in particular, fear of death, especially when it follows quickly and almost inexorably connected to a murder.
As the David Hume's suicide, "no man has never rejected the lives that it was worth living.
This is our natural horror of death..., "even Schopenhauer believed that" when the horrors of life to reach the point where they are beyond the horrors of death, a man puts an end to his life.
But the terrors which were the death against considerable resistance... "
Opponents of the death penalty claim often État has no right, morally, to take the lives of anyone, even as the murderer in the most reprehensible.
But it is a conclusion quite wrong to think that capital punishment is a deterrent.
To see why assume that for every murderer executed, (instead of, say, be sentenced to life in prison) the number of murders is reduced to three, which is a figure much lower than Ehrlich and other estimates of the effect of deterrence.
This means that for every murderer not yet implemented, three innocent victims will die.
In fact, the government 'would' indirectly many lives if it did not use the death penalty.
Save three innocent lives for each person executed seems a very attractive, and even two lives saved by implementing cost / benefit ratio is a persuasive in favour of the death penalty.
We must agree, however, that the argument in favour of capital punishment is less clear-cut when the number of lives saved each execution.
But even if one life was saved in each execution, the market can still be desirable if life saved is much better than life removed, which is usually the case.
Many are protesting at the idea to compare the quality of life saved and one which is suppressed.
But I do not see how to avoid such a comparison.
Take the case of a criminal career wheel and killing a victim who led a life right and left several children and a partner behind it.
There he can save the life of an innocent victim in performing a criminal.
It seems clear that saved the lives of such a victim must carry more weight than take the lives of the criminal.
Évidemment, all the cases are not so clear, but a comparison of the qualities of individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy.
This is why the death penalty should be used for the murders and not for the less serious crimes.
When it comes to choose between taking the lives and, for example, reduce flights on private property, the theory of the more lenient punishment is much more powerful.
Although serious assaults, including some rape appalling, are sometimes the murders in their seriousness, and may call the death penalty, I am not for its use in such cases.
One of the main arguments to book the death penalty in the murders is the "deterrence marginal."
If the attacks were punished by the death penalty, it would push the attackers to kill their victims not to be discovered (which is a major reason for the severity of punishment is proportional to the seriousness of crimes).
One of the complications may be, however, that a murderer will fight with more determination to avoid being caught, which could cause more deaths.
But, although the marginal deterrence is important, I believe that the resistance of murderers to their capture, sometimes at the expense of their own lives, is really an indirect evidence that criminals are afraid of death.
Of course, the risk of executing innocent people that worries me.
My support for the death penalty faiblirait much if the rate of executions of innocent people were also important that the claim.
However, I believe that the appeal process to États-unis provide protection, not against wrongful convictions against unfair executions, which means that there was little or no cases of people executed it is proved that they were innocent.
And this situation has been immensely strengthened by the development of identification by DNA.
I say again that the debate surrounding the death penalty is a debate on the power of deterrence (which can be reduced by calls for too long).
I can understand that some remain skeptical before the existing evidence, although I think they are wrong about this and the sense of the problem.
It is very disturbing to take somebody's life, even a murderer, but sometimes acts of extremely unpleasant are necessary to prevent behaviour worse with the deaths of innocent victims.

The people against Putin
I have contributed to the choice of Vladimir Putin to follow the first democratically elected president, Boris Yeltsin.
Étant given that structures such as the KGB and the Mafia run today Russia and handle the judicial system, it is accepted that Yeltsin himself wanted to choose his successor to avoid prosecution.
But we who have chosen Putin, were charged with finding a successor to continue reforms initiated by Yeltsin, and not someone who would protect him and his family.
Yeltsin was afraid of anything, and not thought to its own survival, but the survival of the democratic principles that he had introduced in Russia.
This idea is now threatened by the successor to that we have chosen.
I do not seek to deny responsibility for my support for Putin.
We were not intimate friends, but he and I have worked together in critical situations, and I never doubted her sincerity.
Putin is in his beliefs.
The problem is that his convictions, including the belief that Russia can prosper if it is led by a single source of power, are incorrect.
And this error of Russia to his downfall.
Évidemment, nobody can take a post to high responsibilities without committing misunderstandings, even of fundamental errors, and this is especially true when times are confused.
Yeltsin was not the exception, but he acknowledged mistakes.
When he withdrew the 31 December 1999, he said sorry to have triggered the war in Chechnya.
Putin, however, seems incapable of recognizing and admit mistakes, and still a long after its failure is apparent in the eyes of the world.
One of the errors of Yeltsin was his failure to put the moral priorities at the head of his reform programme.
Russia should repent of Stalinism and system of gulags.
The entire nation, without exception, should repent, as the Germans have done since 1945.
This failure, because it has allowed the unconditional faith of Putin in the central authority leads to a new capture of the État by the security services.
Indeed, a direct result of repentance national should have been the ban of the Communist Party and the disqualification of all political post of those who worked for the KGB.
Even if such Tris policies are not simple in post-communist societies, where victims and staff were so many, and the border between the two sometimes so blurred, a viable solution could be found, as in the Czech Republic.
The choice to do nothing has left the Russian security structures unscathed and able to make their return on the political scene, what they achieved today.
The resurrection of political structures of the KGB under Putin, and their efforts to silence the despised, have again changed Russia in a country of defectors.
It is impossible to silence the politicians and the independent media without stifling the independent sources of funding, which explains that the Kremlin of Putin has focused his attacks on the so-called "oligarchs".
The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his trial have been orchestrated for this reason.
By the independent financial sources, the security services who dominate the Kremlin might destroy the lives independent policy in Russia.
Without any basis for independent thinking, this is a climate of fear that unfolds.
But the fear is not only offensive, it does not allow to govern.
Yeltsin had intuitively understand that fear and decision making top-down centralised and could not be the right way of running a modern country, and he therefore keen to reform the relationship between citizens and the État.
Putin is still not a centralised political system is also unable to understand and correct mistakes today as it was in the Soviet era.
Without a solid education, Putin is, quite frankly, making Russia to the same disintegration that accompanied the break-up of the Soviet État.
The people are beginning to see it.
He notes that the desire for Putin to create a modern État strong and effective cannot be achieved, as a modern État is governed not happening, but by citizens informed that force their leaders to recognize and correct their mistakes.
Putin, too, seems to accuse the impotence of his regime.
This is one of the reasons that have made Russia if aggressive with its neighbours, Ukraine and Georgia, and that the push to maintain a military presence in places like Transdneistria, the secessionist region of Moldova.
To get in the neighbouring regions of Russia, the Kremlin believes it can persuade the Russians of his omnipotence.
Étant given that the debates in Russia are châtrés and that the Kremlin is able to rig the elections, regime change is the only solution that there is to preserve the idea of democracy.
It is pointless to cling to the illusions.
Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and say that if the regime fails to uphold the constitution, they have the right of the force by all means.
Today, the question of power in Russia can no longer decide to vote.
As in Ukraine, Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan, it will decide in the streets.

Saddle and spend (SVP.)
Excessive taxation can blunt the encouragement and hamper growth.
But a poor can also produce the same effects.
The governments with a small tax revenue may not provide essential public goods.
Worse, a tax revenue in poor countries is often flaws inherent to the tax recovery (rather than tax rates low), which also encourage the lack of productivity.
India illustrates the importance of a tax system well designed.
In Bangalore, high-tech companies have built the campus of world-class extant grasslands in perfect condition and communication networks of high-speed data.
Outside the campus, however, are spreading sewage and garbage not charged and roads in a state of decay.
While the technology companies téraoctets instantly transmit the data to the distant continents, the local transport advance at a rate almost medieval.
Therefore, companies in Bangalore exploit their own bus services, outsourcing with private providers for drinking water, and install generators to protect themselves against the power failures.
The state cannot compensate for this disaster because it is bankrupt.
The debt of the government of India exceeds 70% of GDP so that more than half of its tax revenues are spent on interest payments.
But the debt is not the fact of excessive expenses in the past.
The government of India account for around 15% of GDP, against an average of about 40% of GDP of the OECD.
The financial difficulties in India have to cause a tax system ill-conceived and badly managed.
The rates and the rules for income taxes for individuals and companies appear to be reasonable given the international standards.
However, the government of India collects taxes on income, which represent only about 3.7% of GDP, roughly half those of South Korea and other Asian tigers.
Agriculture in India is about a quarter of GDP, but even the rich farmers do not pay taxes.
The export businesses in the software industry and in other industries benefit from a temporary tax exemption on their profits, although their employees to pay taxes on their personal income.
Despite reasonable rates, tax fraud is commonplace.
Fraud is because the government has not invested in the staff or in the systems to discover the taxpayers intractable, which are rarely in prison and who can often be out of paying bribes when they are caught.
More subtly, flight taxes "direct" on income and profits reflects the disorder inherent in the tax system "indirect" from the production and consumption.
The excise duty account for more than 60% of indirect taxes from India, which are to turn the same proportion of its tax revenue.
The excise duty has been set at 16% of the value of the production of a company.
Then follow different cuts, and surtaxes exemptions.
For example, a "level of law to conditions in favour of 8% is taken from groups like the food, Spirits, the son of cotton and computers.
A 'excise duty special "another 8% is taken from products that include separate bundles in polyester, cars, climatiseurs and tyres.
A "further excise duty" (not to confuse with the "excise duty special") is taken from "products of particular importance".
The relief of excise duties are numerous and complex, including the companies with total annual income of less than 10 million rupees and businesses located in some areas rough or backward.
In general, exemptions fall into 70 major categories, themselves sous-divisées in 259 entries, 52, conditions and 7 lists, each containing many elements.
Exemptions for abuse.
For a certain amount, officials at the bottom of the hierarchy, which have shown a discretion exemplary in the implementation of the conditions, can be encouraged to give interpretations.
The products with high rates (for example, the granite polite) are sold as products taxed at lower rates (for example, like granite unpolished).
Fraud in excise duty is more contagious than tax fraud on the profits and revenues.
If a business fraud excise duty and that the tax rate is high compared with profit margins before tax in the industry, its competitors must also go just to survive.
While the fraud rises, the governments take rights' extra 'or' special 'that lead to greater fraud.
Perceptions of direct taxes also suffer.
The bribe paid the tax man excise duties for a classification, the difference between the value of the granite polite and unpolished, and the omission of registration of the real incomes are creating the funds' black 'which cannot be declared on the forms of statement of income.
In addition to weaken the state's capacity to provide public goods, the key to escape the indirect taxes discourage businesses also adopting technologies more productive, which requires technologies involving a large-scale deployment.
But as indirect taxes can be more easily circumvented by several small units instead of one big unit, it is impossible to achieve economies of scale.
It is important to note that in the software industry, where all the units are exempted from indirect taxes, Indian companies to operate on a scale effective.
India could follow the example of China, where the rationalisation of indirect taxes in 1994 has prepared the ground for a big boom?
Or the governments of the coalition in a vigorous democracy are incapable of such a reform?
Last year, the government led by the BJP India has passed a law allowing significant reductions in the budget deficit.
Then he appointed a working group to make the necessary changes to the policies of public spending and tax policies.
In July, the working group has proposed to increase taxes (rather than cut spending) by removing the majority of exemptions indirect taxes, among other things.
The new Congress-led government of India also seems to promote these proposals.
If Congress and the opposition parties are, they will help to support economic growth and to dispel the idea that democracies cannot take the necessary measures to encourage the development.

What is the problem with Turkey?
On 16 December, Orhan Pamuk, a famous authors Turks, will face a court in Istanbul. It should respond to accusations of "insult to the national identity" to be voted in favour of an open discussion on the genocide by the Turks to 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.
Pamuk has three years in prison.
Turkey's efforts to impose fines and jail terms to those who go beyond the official framework convince me that I had reason to oppose the opening of negotiations on the country's accession to the European Union.
In December 1999, the European Council has granted to Turkey candidate status, which meant that Turkey will enter the Union for a future date has not yet set.
Then the council asked the European Commission to decide until October 2004 if Turkey met the criteria required for membership, which include democracy, rule of law and respecting the rights of ethnic minorities.
This decision was one of the last taken by Romano Prodi's commission, which I was a member.
Among its 30 members, 29 have said that Turkey was sufficiently to the criteria to be able to continue.
I was the only dissident.
The report of the Commission on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, then in charge of EU enlargement, who was my decision.
The report stated that in 2003, approximately 21 870 Turks have sought asylum in the EU, including 2 127 have been accepted.
In other words, the EU governments themselves have acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted over 2,000 of its own citizens.
Meanwhile, the commission published a progress report on Turkey, considering that the reforms were continuing, although at a slower pace, under the guidance moderately Islamic government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The report but state serious doubts: human rights violations, including torture, continued, the military influence retained too big; freedom of expression was not universally seen; minorities non-Islamic religious and cultural were victims of discrimination and violence against women are facing a sufficiently strong opposition.
The situation has not changed much since the discussions on the accession began in October.
Beyond the persecution of Pamuk is currently the victim, behaviour unacceptable abound.
In March 2005, the police violently intervened in a demonstration marking International Women's Day.
In May, the largest teaching union has been banned for supporting the education of 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their own language.
It is undeniable that intolerance is to the heights of the Turkish government.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul has recently cancelled sharply a press conference in Copenhagen when he saw a Kurdish journalist in the public that Danes have refused to leave.
Such actions, such attitudes are largely my disagreement in October 2004.
But even if these problems were corrected, Turkey should not be permitted in the EU, because this is not a European country.
Christianity, the féodalité, the Renaissance, the lights, democracy and industrialisation have made us Europeans that we are, but they have not been Turks what they are.
So I am not sure that reforms in Turkey, implemented because of the European Commission, would be prosecuted after membership.
I suspect that there would be of re-offending.
In addition, Turkey's accession would lead to that of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
These first three countries are certainly more European than Turkey.
Leaving aside the three Caucasus republics but with the États following Yugoslavia, that would give an EU some 35 states.
What kind of union even?
The EU is not merely a club with friends.
It is founded on freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.
The commission, as guardian of the Union treaties, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it sometimes has to persuade and, if necessary to force, États-membres to change their laws.
The policies on alcohol in Sweden, the loi-volkswagen in Germany and discrimination against the funds of foreign investment in France are examples of cases that have made the commission unpopular.
But they were necessary.
À when I left the commission, I had to myself a stack of 1,500 findings of irregularities in this style.
In short, joining the EU means accepting incisive measures which deeply affect the internal affairs of a État.
It is impossible with members also different.
The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy calls "Imperial surextension."
It would dilute a way unacceptable.
This is why the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkey's membership will lead to the end of the EU, and this is why the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said: "Turkey's accession would be more than the EU could bear."
But the biggest reason to oppose Turkey's membership is a matter of democracy: the majority of the population of the EU wants to simply not.

The crisis in Bolivia, failure of Latin America.
Bolivia is not a typical of Latin America.
And if this was the turmoil of Haitian, this would be the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere: it is even less stable Haiti as its history and his two cents to État since its independence.
In a region in the past indigenous strong, but at present fragmented and isolated, Bolivia is, perhaps, with Guatemala, the only Latin American countries where the indigenous peoples, represent the majority population.
Its topography and its distribution ethnic generate autonomous and even separatist forces that threaten the national unity in a much more provocative than anywhere else.
And it is, of course, Paraguay, the only country in the whole subcontinent denied access to the sea.
It would be imprudent to extrapolate the crisis in Bolivia to the rest of Latin America.
The extension would be far too simplistic: the institutions are much stronger, poverty, and particularly poverty, has been reduced and the struggles of ownership of natural resources have generally been settled.
Even in countries such as Venezuela, which has huge reserves of oil and has a nationalist government in mind traditional, the status quo had enabled the preservation of foreign investments during the almost eight years of government of President Hugo Chavez.
Even if the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, since the Chiapas until the "Araucania" of the Amazon until Ayacucho, they have never posed any real threat to national integrity in any country in Latin America.
Thus, Bolivia is not a crisis an omen, nor the eternal ‘ domino theory, "which Lyndon Jonhson and Che guevarra believed both in the case of Bolivia, is valid or even partially reasonable.
However, the current crisis in Bolivia, shows the finger at the "democratic deficit" afflicting Latin America.
The elected leaders are set in failure for a reason or another in Bolivia, Équateur and Haiti.
Democracy is faulty or absent in Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua, and is under threat, pure reason or another in Venezuela and Colombia.
None of these cases like the other and they are all different degrees of risk, destruction and reconciliation.
Is: what can be done against this, which contrasts strongly with the encouraging signs that prevailed until recent years.
At the last meeting of the Organization of American États held in very Lauderdale in Florida, the delegation of États-unis has set a good idea provided by others and were simply cast because of his support.
The story began two years earlier when Dante Caputo, former foreign minister from Argentina, and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) were responsible for preparing a report on democracy in Latin America.
Their findings showed an early-warning system of democracy in the region would help to generate some actions before any loss of control, such as Bolivia today.
Mr Caputo and the team of UNDP had convinced Chile's President Ricardo Lagos, take care of the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues.
He has done without the initiative goes too far.
In fact, the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America, published in 2004, referred to death.
The États-unis and the new secretary general of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, have been relaunched at the meeting of the OAS in Florida, but it was killed by fears of reasonable Latin Americans believe that there is action against Venezuela, combined with fears anachronistic Latin Americans on the violation of the sacred to no intervention.
Despite the fact that the continent to agree on the principle, the idea of an early-warning system should be studied.
Today, the American community has probably little possibility of intervention on the situation in Bolivia, and yet it is dangerous for everyone.
Evo Morales, the opposition leader and growers of coca leaves, is perhaps an honest Democratic leader, a rather unwise, but its supporters are all released an authoritarian?
Hugo Chavez is perhaps not Mr Morales and other dissidents Bolivians, but Venezuela and Cuba are not tempted to meddle in the affairs of this country where Che guevarra died at the head of the guerrilla almost 40 years earlier?
The business community of Santa Cruz in Bolivia may not give due to its threat of secession, but préfèreront-ils share of oil and natural gas reserves of their region with the indigenous peoples of the Highland rather than with the Brazilian of Sào Paulo?
Before the events are extreme, it may be right that the OAS (and not the États-unis) should not interfere.
The region continues to need that participation in term time, message and the Democratic platform, separate from the American intervention and traditional indifference than usual in Latin America.

The decline in France?
The French are notoriously susceptible, not to say on the defensive about the scale of France abroad.
The French state spends a large sum to the spread of the French language and culture, but the French are painfully aware that the global position in their country is not what it was.
In this context, not surprisingly, in the last presidential elections, the publication of a European Commission report saying that the economic status of France among European countries had passed the 3
The OECD and Eurostat, the European body to meet these data, believed to have put an end to this aspect of the debate by demonstrating that France, Germany, Italy and Britain were all levels of life at roughly the same per capita.
But the controversy to a larger scale has not gone away.
The allegations concern on the French "decline" have reappeared with the protest marches held this year against pension reform, the growing differences on fiscal policy with the European Commission and the bickering with America on the war in Iraq.
The book not romancé successful in France at the moment is a polemic written by Nicolas Baverez, France, which falls.
The book of Baverez is full of quotes from de Gaulle and Napoleon.
According to the author, the latest achievements of France back to the 1970s, with the train, the TGV, and Airbus.
It has severe Mitterrand and Chirac combined with a "talent to win the elections and to make France a loser."
The success of the book is itself a sign of "unease".
But what kind?
The evidence of degeneracy made by Baverez are not so convincing that he wants to believe.
For example, he cites the depletion of industrial jobs as proof the more dramatic declines in France.
But the result is a common to all advanced countries.
Indeed, France has in fact better than most of its rich competitors neighbours and, unlike Germany, the UK or US, it has maintained the same market share in the industrial sector that it owned in the early 1970s.
Also, according to a more precise competitiveness and foreign investment, France has excellent results in these areas.
After a recent report published by the Council of Economic Analysis, the direct investments in France rose to 60 billion in 2001, almost twice as much as Germany.
The French competitive cost has also improved (20%) in the past three decades, productivity higher counterbalancing the rapid growth in wages.
But the heart of the economic problems in the long term of France lies precisely in fear of losing the industrial jobs.
France is an industrial power strong in traditional sectors such as automotive and aerospace, but it has been delayed in innovative markets on which the smaller businesses say the new technologies.
France, for example, spends only $30 billion per year in research and development of advanced technologies, against 51 billion dollars for Germany, 98 billion dollars in Japan and 265 billion dollars for the United States.
In short, the analysis of Baverez hand in the wrong direction.
France has taken several major reforms over the past two decades: economic liberalisation and financial, the elimination of price controls and exchange rate, the end restrictions on credit, European liberalisation, reducing inflationary and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and globalisation forced companies in the country.
The French malaise certainly was not caused by these reforms.
The problem of France has just what it has failed to recognise the new world that she is already part.
The French capitalism is dead and France does not accept his disappearance.
France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, felt obliged to apologise after having said on television that "the state is not all-powerful."
There are several reasons for this schizophrenia, French, but most of them is the political game the past 20 years.
Until 1981, France was clearly divided between right and left.
Since that period, the administrations Mitterrand and Chirac have taken their ideological side in order to implement the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and globalisation.
A "shock therapy" to the SRM. Thatcher two decades ago could forge a new political consciousness.
But the move slowly and consensual reforms of the French to live in a world and think in another.
This is largely the political upheaval that exploded in the last presidential campaign, when the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen has reached the second round of presidential elections in the outgoing Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
The rise of the extreme left, which has brought 10% of votes in this presidential campaign, also of this political failure.
France needs a political revolution more than an economic revolution, if it wants to come to accept the reality, including the fact that the French "decline" is a fear created by the French people.

The value of European values
European leaders have included the constitutional issues that had ended in December following a dispute on voting rights.
These debates are naturally lead to compromise, this will be soon.
Still need to understand clearly what the goals are supposed to the constitution.
Two fundamental principles have led to European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.
These two principles are at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology and the law.
For years, they have is an integral part of the legal and institutional structure of the European Union, in the treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which the quote in the preamble) and in the recent draft constitution.
In short, they are included in the history and ideals of the EU.
But what is the real significance of these two principles?
Take the solidarity, which lends itself to two interpretations at least: solidarity static, which is solely for the distribution of income and wealth, and the wider concept of solidarity dynamics, which is on the production of income and wealth.
In the history of post-war European integration, solidarity momentum has strongly indicated during the first period, the European Coal and Steel, both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction) in the treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.
This does not mean that solidarity dynamic was subsequently removed: the European monetary union, for example, expresses perfectly.
And, although some countries were not immediately benefited from the euro, they have nevertheless accepted because they were convinced that it would have positive effects on the long term.
In other words, solidarity dynamic means to promote policies that encourage investment, innovation, economic growth and employment.
However, as reported GDP growth in the EU solidarity momentum has been damaged during the last decade.
The gap between research and development, is particularly worrying.
The implementation of the so-called Lisbon strategy, the EU adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the world's most competitive economy, is threatened by the growing importance attached to the solidarity static, reflected in the high costs of social aid and high taxes needed to finance it.
The primacy of solidarity static is due to an ageing population who, together with a sluggish growth, has led to the fiscal imbalances.
One of the greatest challenges posed to become the EU is to treat the predominance of solidarity static, which is geared towards the elderly, at the expense of solidarity dynamics, which encourages young people.
After all, the union cannot allow the current consumption continues to prevail on the investment needed in the future prosperity.
The subsidiary is similar to the concept of solidarity in what his interpretation is twofold: the vertical and horizontal subsidiarity.
Subsidiarity vertically on the distribution of power between the different levels of government and sovereignty, the EU member states, regions and municipalities.
The most well known of this principle is federalism.
The European treaties clearly express the subsidiarity.
But this is enough to cover the canvas institutional and constitutional emerging from the Union?
The horizontal subsidiarity is the responsibility and freedom of human beings and on the social and economic powers.
It includes relations between the state, society and the market.
But the company and the market have their own rights and their own sovereign states that are not granted by the state.
Occurs when the next problem: how to ensure the autonomy of each Kingdom?
One example of subsidiarity across the European market which has created a new type of economic freedom and increased competition between companies by eliminating the protection that national governments offering.
The horizontal subsidiarity means that in society and in the economic sphere, the state cannot violate freedom and individual responsibility, which must be met at the highest possible level.
It also means that a 'higher power' to support each time that the freedom and individual responsibility, not enough to achieve the goals needed to human dignity.
This support, however, must be allowed in ways that promotes the natural potential of individuals, society and the market.
But this is possible if the role of the horizontal subsidiarity is clear, this was not the case in the EU treaties, the charter of fundamental human rights or the work of the European Convention.
In short, solidarity is today a redistribution rather than a growth (the current generation expressed solidarity with future generations) whereas the subsidiary is the distribution of political power rather than a cautious of the borders between the state, civil society and the market.
At the moment, these two values are set to encourage the state.
Indeed, the emphasis on growth oriented towards the market has often been identified with the values semi-étrangères of America.
But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and they must be uprooted again.
The EU must restore its economic vitality in pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity more balanced in favour of the market and society, which would reduce the socio-economic impact of the state.
The public institutions must produce public assets (such as defence, justice and fiscal and monetary policy), the company must offer services (such as culture, education and helping the needy) and the market must produce goods (related to profits, growth and employment).
In the 21st century Europe must review the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if it wants to achieve the goal of integration: freedom and prosperity needed to overcome differences and the political divisions that led to the tragedies in the 20th century.
This is the spirit in which must be drawn up the European Constitution.

The politics of values
The debate on the American elections has not wavered.
How can President George W. Bush was able to reach three million votes of more than Senator John Kerry, and offer a Republican majority in both houses of Congress?
There is little on the answers, but two are recurring themes in many explanations.
One of these issues in his personality.
In our time full of uncertainty and threatening, people have put their trust in a president they knew rather than in a candidate who has not yet delivered.
The second is that of values.
The people voted for a set of values rather than specific policies.
Indeed, some (say) agree with the policies of Mr Kerry but have yet made their votes for Mr Bush because they felt "comfortable" with her overall attitude.
It is clear that the États-unis are now deeply divided in electoral terms.
One of États ark blue (Democrat), North and West stretches around a huge red zone (Republican) at the centre and the South.
Beyond the geographical division, the divisions recur at local level.
The gerrymandering, this practice of retraçage borders to promote a political party at the expense of another, is no longer needed.
Voters tend to be moved into areas where the majority of people share their values, whether Republican or Democrat.
What are these values, exactly?
These are the values that deal, what we said, ‘ God, guns and gay. "
Religion plays a role, especially with the truths of the Bible in the history of creation.
The possession of a weapon is the ultimate test of individualism and the use of weapons in times of war is not obscene.
Gay and other practices "modern" are rejected, because among selfcentred.
As the scientist Andrew Hacker said recently, "the candidacy of Mr Bush has been built to form a majority in giving to 60 million voters the chance to feel good about themselves."
This is an American phenomenon, or there are other trends elsewhere?
One answer to that as an American phenomenon, the politics of values may well get a majority today but is not in any case.
Europe and other parts of the world is divided in the same way.
Personality will no doubt, and under the obvious political differences are also questions of values that have not been brought to light.
However, differences traditional policies based on the disagreement on core values are still lower in the elections.
The Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, another leader facing an election in his country, plays the map of the personality and talk about policies, but is primarily a set of values of middle class.
When he speaks of "modernisation" or "into the 21st century," he manages to suggest a strange but attractive for change and stability.
This leaves the conservative opposition without any effective response.
Even the issues of tax cuts and asylum stricter fail to fly on the strings of the melody of values that the Republican party has managed to make the États-unis.
The situation is the same in Germany, where the influence of the politics of values is even less.
The debate in Germany, is still in its most political debate.
When the opposition is the government to negotiate the welfare reform or, more recently, to combat unemployment, the underlying challenge is not in terms of values, but instead of competence.
However, under the traditional battles of the political debate English or German, or elsewhere in Europe, the clash of values.
The parties are fighting for those who can "feel comfortable in their own place ’, but they perhaps do not understand very well that this is only partly a matter of policy.
Religion will never be an important factor in European politics: opinion polls show that the religious practice remains a few main differences between Americans and Europeans.
The weapons also occupy a place in the minds of Europe: it is their absence that Europeans see as important.
Europe is also without doubt a pacifist values.
And the question of political correctness (the "gay") also plays a role less so far in Europe.
Above all, Europe itself is dividing the Europeans, as the 'national issue "is present in all États Europeans.
It is a question of values, inspired by fear.
People want to know where they stand and, in the wake, will turn against the États-unis and towards Europe or against Europe and to their own countries.
In all ways, we are leaving the kingdom of policies and politics, and are entering the area marécageux symbols and myths.
What, in any case, is the main danger democracies face, because the political values is a dangerous development.
It brought the fundamental divisions of a society whose greatest achievement of democracy was precisely to banish fundamentalism of political life.
An informed public debate must be a discussion on the policies contained in a community values.
So it is essential to insist on this important goal of the policy of freedom.

The advent of interest
One swallow does not the spring and a single month of growth of employment and price rises in the US does not mean that the Federal Reserve does not fear more unease and deflation.
But the time will come when the global interest rates will begin to increase as central bankers are preparing to resist the tide of rising inflation.
When that time will come, whether this autumn, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007, America and the global economy will face of financial vulnerabilities reflecting the success of the last three years of monetary stimulus in arresting the decline in production, and by curbing unemployment.
The short-term interest rates are surprisingly low: only 2% in the euro zone, just 1% in the United States and zero in Japan.
The monetary expansion, which has proved a success, but only after bringing interest rates at levels below historical and have convinced investors that borrowing costs would remain at their current levels for long.
The stimulus has mainly been to increase prices of assets: everything that produced a benefit, a dividend or rent becomes much more attractive, and much more valuable in financial terms, when interest rates are very low and should remain.
This explains the huge differentiation between the current price of real estate in the United States, the ordinary shares in New York, London and Frankfurt, and the obligations on the long term anywhere in the world and what should be, conventionally, their core values.
What happens when central banks begin to raise interest rates?
In 1994, raising interest rates on the short term has led to higher rates on the long term (and lower prices of obligations on the long term) of at least twice the size of the standard models this year.
Interest rates of peripheral economies have also increased the rate of the major advanced industrial countries.
The first danger for 2005 and for the coming years, when the global interest rates will increase, as it is likely, is another wave of financial crises of the emerging markets.
For countries like Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, the record of the 1990s shows that the differences in interest rates can grow and capital flows to reverse a remarkably quickly, whatever the level of friendliness with which the representatives of the IMF and analyses by the big banks are the policies of a country.
The differences in interest rates in emerging markets are currently abnormally low.
The international currency markets, capital inflows in the US apart, are not yet at the levels associated with an "irrational exuberance, but it was likely to happen before interest rates begin to rise.
This is alarming because if there is a lesson of the 1990s, is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows.
The second danger comes from higher values of the active in the main advanced industrial countries.
The way of thinking dominant within the Federal Reserve, which I fully support, argues that the information technology revolution continues, that potential output in the US is always very quickly and that the output gap is relatively high.
This means that interest rates will certainly remain low for a relatively long period.
In addition, confidence in the Federal Reserve is great, and the last vestiges of the premium of the risk of inflation in the 1970s there is no interest rates.
Therefore, even after that production levels are returned to their potential level, interest rates remain low, according to the standards of the 1980s and 1990s.
This is obviously good news for those who hold assets such as bonds on the long term, stock and property.
Indeed, the rising prices of active on the long term was precisely what had hoped the lower interest rates: make the bondholders, and particularly property owners, richer does, after all, a boost to spending.
But the bad news is that even if interest rates are supposed to remain low for some time, they will not be as low indefinitely.
The key is that when interest rates rise, the values of assets are falling.
It is during these periods, especially when the values of assets fall quickly and significantly, we discover the full extent of our central bankers in their main task: to reduce the volatility in financial and economic stability.
It is also during these periods that we discover how individuals who hold bonds in the long term, the property or shares have not because they believe current prices are reasonable compared to basic prices, but because their prices have risen in recent years.
It is a crucial issue for policymakers policies for people who have bought the assets on the long term because the price seemed to increase indefinitely are also those who sell as soon as the trend seems to be reversed.
Specifically, the trade deficit the US heralds a mass instability if asset prices in the long term should drop dramatically.
The challenges that will arise in the decision-making of economic policies of the world over the coming years diffèreront of those they have faced since the collapse of the illusion of the Nasdaq.
The associated risks to inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by a production to fall and the threat of deflation.
But, as we have learned during the 1990s, that does not mean that the challenges ahead will be easier to resolve.

The futures opposed to America.
I recently discovered an interesting: American economists who are involved in international finance and the macroeconomists Americans who are concerned the domestic economy have very different perspectives -- in fact, opposed -- on the possible consequences of the huge US deficit.
Economists of International Finance, consider that a financial crisis is possible, followed by a painful and prolonged the recession may États-unis.
The macroeconomists dealing with the domestic economy instead see the next fall in value of the dollar not as a crisis but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.
The macroeconomists who examined the domestic economy are generally the situation as follows: at a time in the future, the foreign central banks will be less inclined to pursue their massive purchases of securities in dollars to support the greenback.
When they will put an end to their programmes to buy dollars to large scale, the value of the dollar will fall, and it will fall sharply.
And, at this point of view, if the value of the dollar declines, the American exports will become much more attractive to foreign markets and the employment market in America will resume, labor being redirected to the new export industries in the boom.
The situation will be comparable to that of Britain when it abandoned its index of exchange rates and left the pound depreciate against the German mark, or what came to États-unis at the end of the 1980s when the dollar is déprécia compared to the book, the mark and -- especially -- compared to the Japanese yen.
Economists of international finance describe a future more gloomy.
They see the end of programmes to buy dollars to large scale by central banks will not only to the dollar decline but also to a soaring rate of American interests in the long term, which will depress household consumption, and will regulate investment spending after a short time.
Certainly, economists of international finance is also a belief that American exports will benefit from the falling dollar but the differences in demand is such that the surge in exports will be only one or two years after the decline in consumption and investment spending.
Eight to ten million people will have to move the services sector and construction sector import and export of goods, which means that structural unemployment will rise.
In addition, perhaps to a financial panic: the large financial institutions with obligations in the short-term and long-term assets will have difficulties to bear a strong rise in long-term interest rates denominated in dollars.
The cause of inequality can lead to a certain tension and a bankruptcy just as easily as those caused crises in Mexico and Asia in the 1990s or Argentina this decade of active in local currency and the dollar bonds that held the banks.
When the economists in international finance put forward this scenario, the macroeconomists specialising in the domestic economy their claim that it resembles a case of incompetence on monetary policy.
Why the Federal Reserve should it allow the rise in long-term interest rates when the foreign central banks will end their programmes to buy dollars?
Then, should not intervene and take over by buying US Treasury bond in the long term, maintaining and long-term interest rates at a satisfactory level to encourage full employment?
Economists of international finance are generally that the Federal Reserve was not the ability to do so.
Forced to choose between full employment and price stability, according to them, the Federal Reserve chooses the stability of prices, because its institutional memory of the 1970s and soaring inflation remains very powerful.
So, since the fall in value of the dollar pushed import and works as a negative shock on the supply side in the economic sector, the Federal Reserve will increase and not cut its interest rates and therefore sell rather than buying government bonds.
Economists serious that I have great respect for are to take a stand on opposite sides of this debate.
I am not enough to give reason to one or other, but I know no doubt which side I hope to see wrong.

The worst performers of Europe
The États-unis, states with fiscal policies are misguided are penalised.
Their obligations to sell on the cheap compared to other states managed.
The service the debt higher than they should pay point to a degree of disciplinary action against the temptation to spend today and pay later.
Of course, market discipline is not perfect: the bond market will "see" the future liabilities implicit (such as payments promised pensions).
However, the application of this fiscal discipline, coupled with internal budget process of every state has prevented the occurrence of fiscal crisis of the États-unis since the Great Depression.
Consider the case of Europe.
Before the advent of the euro, many États of southern Europe were fiscal crises, producing waves of high inflation.
But with the introduction of the single currency, the way to resolve a fiscal crisis by inflation has been closed since the European Central Bank (ECB) oversees monetary policy.
However, even if the nations can no longer rely on inflation to address the imbalance of their finances, the single currency allows them to use the ability of debt which belongs to other members of the European Union to extend their spending boom and push their political responsibility during periods of leave the good time rolled.
It is to avoid the possibility that the EU has created the stability and growth pact: the budget deficit of governments must not exceed 3% of GDP.
Last week, the German government, once the European country, the most prudent and disciplined in the fiscal, broke the rules of the pact for the fifth consecutive year, without really (many) of excuses.
The finance minister Peer Steinbrueck has indicated that he expected the European Commission applies sanctions against Germany: the credibility of the pact would be, he says, put in jeopardy if no action was done.
Thus, Germany would not block the sanctions this time, as has been the case two years ago.
But Steinbrueck has also made clear he did that to a purely symbolic sanctions in response to the budget deficit from 3.4% of GDP, and no penalties that would have a true cost to the government or its economy.
The growth and stability pact is not, or not, to work as planned at the start.
What about market discipline?
The will of the German government to increase its debt and increase its deficits is limited by the fact that the market recognizes and penalizes nations who leave their fiscal position erode?
In a word, no.
Interest rates on sovereign debt in the twelve governments of the euro zone are very similar.
The market is not thought that countries have different potential to create export financing the flow of funds needed to repay debts, or differents deficit / GDP ratios current or planned.
Willem Buiter, the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert, from London University, estimates that it is the acceptance of the ECB to all the deficit in the eurozone as a guarantee that has undermined the will of the market to become the controller of fiscal restraint.
As part of German marginal debt is used as collateral for a short-term loan, or as a centrepiece of an operation of pension fought to acquire liquidity, its value is more likely to be determined by the terms under which the ECB accepts it as a guarantee that its fundamental.
The treatment by the ECB of any debt that is as important as a source of liquidity reserve false now any differential analysis of sovereign risk in the long term.
It is dangerous in the long term.
It is necessary to have both a market discipline and a sound fiscal management for a reasonable chance of price stability over the long term.
Omettez today to sanction by the market behaviour can become casse-cou or to activate the levers that give a voice to future generations, and you leave yourself open to suffer serious consequences -- maybe not today or tomorrow, but one day, and for the rest of your life.
À as time passes, the arrival of the single currency, and how the euro has been put in place are increasingly uneasy.
The policy of the euro area in general is too deflationary.
The transfers to render the current currency anathema to the regions that are slowing down or are already in recession when the ECB would apply a more stringent policy are not facts.
The institutional foundations of a fiscal policy stable over the long term are being eroded.
Now, Buiter and Sibert convince us that the ECB gives the market less opportunity to reward the most economical and penalising the spenders than it should.
The land does not yet, and it doesn't happen before a moment.
But the soil under the euro could well become ice if things do not change.

Milosevic and Saddam Hussein even trial, even farce.
The trial for war criminals were once the serious business.
Remember the photographs of Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess, sinister, on the dock at Nuremberg.
Some of the Nazi leaders have even been hanged after the trial relatively short, but fair.
Nowadays, the trial of the leaders of the atrocities of the world have become farcical.
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his friends are a series of the Baath uninterrupted embarrassing moments.
The defendants are trying a singerie after another and Hussein shows of all forms of contempt as possible. The only thing that it has not yet done, is to show its fesses the judge.
It is difficult to expect an outcome that could seem legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or the world.
Meanwhile, Slobodan Milosevic's trial has changed in funeral after four boring years of accounts and $200 million spent unnecessarily.
In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government have stalled for nearly ten years to know how to get the senior Khmer Rouge survivors before the courts.
The mass killers who took power in the twentieth century were sentenced to be killed in the popular revolts or judged for their crimes -- at least, if not die during their term.
Who can feel proud that the last Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania, was shot with his wife without even the appearance of a fair trial?
The formal trappings of a real court are always better than an instant justice, even if the final result is also the death.
Today there are two different plausible to proceed with a dictator deposed.
A nation can send its former leaders in the courts, as the Argentinians in the 1980s with the generals responsible for the loss of more than 5,000 of their fellow citizens.
At international level, the model of Nuremberg remains valid for an example for other trial, although under the conditions admit that the victorious powers sometimes ask for certain crimes, as the "crimes against humanity," which are not properly defined at the moment when they are committed.
There was a time when we could see the benefits of trial in both national and international.
The trial on national territory allowed the local community to give vent to her grief as part of close to the procedure.
As the judges and irreconcilable, fellow of the defendants could also bring greater sensitivity to the estimate of guilt because they could assess the harsh conditions under which a dictator deposed takes decisions.
The trial of the generals in Argentina has been a ritual successful as part of the painful transition from the military junta to democracy, but this experiment ended in a larmoyante called into question.
Even after their condemnation, the generals have been strong enough to demand a denunciation of their trial followed an amnesty for the next president.
Argentine politics is still enchevêtrée in the legal consequences of these trials for 20 years ago.
At international level, the decision of the UN Security Council to establish the international criminal tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICC) has also been welcomed with great confidence.
The ICC has taken several decisions at the foundation under the direction of Antonio Cassese.
But the judges had the misfortune to realise their dream the more expensive: Judge spells disaster in chief, Slobodan Milosevic.
We cannot get a clear idea of how the Serbs would have seen him in a local trial.
Many would have been dependent on the political party that would have controlled the court.
At international level, fears were not about an excess of politics, but in an excess of law.
The Milosevic trial had to be more fair, it should be the emblem of the justice of the UN.
And he was allowed to defend himself -- serious error in terms of length and efficiency of the trial.
There was no limits the number of people that the charge was called to testify on the same dreadful story of the aggression and brutality.
It will take many months to determine the problem and why this scandal to a trial of four years ago.
My hunch is that officials have good intentions of the court were too influenced by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, model sold in schools of law as an alternative desirable to the fairness.
During the trial South Africans, the most important issue was not the future of the defendant but the past victims.
Each victim was encouraged to tell his story and the defendant was listening.
In the case of massacres in the twentieth century, such narrations can last for decades.
To encourage victims to speak and then give the defendant the right to hog the floor and block the trial in praising its merits of political leader are the ingredients for a lengthy session.
One of the lessons learned of the Milosevic trial and Hussein is that it should not judge of men or women to make them lose their appeal, charismatic.
They will the trial, particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves, and use the courtroom to justify their journey.
The tyrants should not be judged as having been clearly routed.
Irony of history, the fact that the Nuremberg tribunal has been driven by representatives of the winners and powerful was an advantage.
They were a constant reminder to Goering, Hess and their henchmen that allies where the Nazis were fatally vanquished.
Punish the perpetrators, rather than train how history is written, has always been the clear goal of the trial.
The tragedy of the Milosevic trial and Hussein is that the points on the 'I' of history are still missing and that the story itself is on trial.
The consistent hesitation officials gave birth to proceedings, both national and international, which have facilitated the fantasies of justification, and return.
In the case of Saddam Hussein, the fantasy could still happen.

The dividing line of the Iraqi economy
All those who study Iraq as a nation divided between the communities of Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.
But there is another split equally important, a division that contributes to the insurgency continues that the sectarian conflict and the opposition to the military occupation led by the Americans, the growing gap between rich and poor in Iraq.
When Iraq was released, the people, especially the poor people, were taken to hope that a charismatic leader of the save of the harsh realities of daily life.
Élevés in fear, they had no idea about how democracy could apply to their society and how the groups in defence of human rights and other organisations in civil rights could help shape their future.
Iraq has quickly found a new line of shares.
On one side were those who understood how to operate in a democracy, come to power and realise the ambitions.
They have learned to speak the language of democracy, to win at the same time money and influence, and to ensure the independent organisations to defend their rights and privileges.
The other side, however, there is a vast population of Iraqis without power, especially women widows, divorced or abandoned without anyone to bear them, they and their children.
For them, democracy and human rights do not mean much.
They are uncultivated, poor and sick.
Victims of an education system which collapsed more than ten years ago, they are trained to find employment in the Iraqi economy withering away.
Under the yoke of Saddam, no effort was made to raise living standards for the poor.
I have visited the big slums Iraqis and families living in homes barely covered a roof, infested with insects everywhere, with open sewers for running through their doors.
Day and night, they live in the black.
No need for nothing less than food, housing, decent and prospects for jobs, these families face the death, terrifiées by the cries of their hungry children.
When I met women who live in these homes, they were being bombarded with questions: democracy allait-elle give them food and houses?
Democracy empêcherait-elle men to beat their wives?
The democratic citizenship to place their children?
Their donnerait-elle the right to divorce spouses who would have abandoned?
À all these questions, I replied 'yes'.
Yes, democracy, you will pay the right to live in a decent home, the right to learn and work, and it will grant citizenship to children and equality between men and women.
But you must work hard and make every effort to demand their rights.
What they replied: "Saddam has learned to be unemployed, silent and fearful for 35 years.
What can we now? "
In these areas indigent where most Iraqis, people are prey to the temptations bitter.
Many are not the scope of political leaders and government.
They fall easily into violence, theft and sabotage.
The poverty that leads some to accept money in exchange for terrorist acts, rendered collusion by the promise of heroism wrong that they could not use during the long reign of Saddam.
Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of violent history of wars and atrocities in Iraq, which has destroyed the sensitivity of the people against the murder.
Although the living conditions in Iraq today lead many young men to violence, I am convinced that it is simply to provide jobs and decent housing for the save.
The jobs, in particular, would help young people to build new lives in jobs.
It should not use posts to disguise the army of unemployed.
We must give people jobs that allow them to contribute positively to the reconstruction of the country.
By nature, each individual is trying to prove useful for his own society.
But the culture that Saddam Hussein has created has convinced the Iraqis that the political connections are the only way of acquiring authority, money and knowledge.
Beyond such sentiments will take time and will require a flourishing economy, which means that the new Iraqi government must have limited powers to facilitate the growth of private sector while encouraging the widespread understanding of democracy and human rights.
Religious groups are ready to participate in this process.
We can also restore the technocrats, who served under Saddam, so that they have a chance to serve their country.
Last point, not least, we must provide loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life.
The government must above all to make every effort to convince the Iraqi people of the value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the Constitution in achieving their aspirations for a better life.
It will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people believe that violate the law is an act of heroism.
We have yet, we, the Iraqis, learned that the power should not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and that the establishment of justice needs to fight corruption in all forms.
If the Constitution must work as a guarantee of democracy, freedom and security, Iraqis who must learn to do their this fight.

The Islamic identity
When you dirigiez your gaze at the moment, Islam is used (and) as a political force.
Some Muslims use them as incentives to work; many Muslims in the West (and in other countries perceive it as a "containment" and "other" exclusion exacting.
As a Turk, I feel these two sides of the debate.
The reason why Islam is like a religion of the "other" to western eyes is that the West has been a systematic deinstitutionalisation religion.
This is not the religion that has disappeared from the modern Western life, of course, but rather claims that the religious institutions can issue on the behaviour of the individual.
Religion in the modern world is more than ever, a personal experience and spiritual.
However, a process of de-institutionalisation of religious experience is also happening within Islam.
The politicization of Islam supersedes the authority of the religious classes of Islam, the ulema.
As in the West, the Islamic religious experience becomes more personal.
The interpretation of religious texts by Muslims, including political activists and intellectuals and women, is a consequence.
Also the knowledge of religious outreach, the lessons of the Koran being bullied and out of context to support political objectives.
Who decides to what is legitimate and what is illegal in Islam?
Who has the authority to interpret the religious texts?
That may issue a fatwa or declaring "jihad"?
Nowadays, activism and terrorism, or rather, a source of legitimacy.
It is and the uninitiated, decide what does or does not mean Islam, without the authority of faith schools and specialist training.
Indeed, Islam today is essentially interpreted by politicians and cultural movements, and not by religious institutions.
This deinstitutionalisation brought Islam to move the status of national and local social ties to the creator of imaginary links between all Muslims worldwide who feel oppressed or displaced.
Islam can Unite members who were deeply divided: the Sufi Muslim scholars and Muslims canonisés of origin Shariat; the Shiite Muslims and Sunni; conservative Saudi Arabia and Iran's revolutionary.
Islam is dynamic, its believers from rural areas for cities, including the Western cities.
Many see this as negative and stress that these individuals are socially adrift and falling in the alienation and, for some, terrorism.
But the social mobility is also a prerequisite for creating a modern outlook.
Of course, migration is a sense of distance among Muslims, if not a complete break, with their social groups.
Their religious experience is new, private institutions theological, community or public.
The religious experience becomes a form of social imagination in which they rebuild a sense of belonging to Islam in an environment in both new and strange.
This is not the distance with modern life, but the proximity of this life that triggers a return to the religious identity.
Indeed, the vast majority of radicalism is evident in groups that, by their experience of mobility and the trip, are familiar with the secular West of political thought and urban life.
Confused by a stranger, these people cling to Islam, which is their only support.
But for that support functions, Islam should be free of his attitude, traditionally obséquieuse passive and submissive to modernity.
By wearing a veil or a beard, claiming the right to obtain places of prayer at work or school and requiring special food, Muslims identify openly as Muslims.
They inform the world that they are more zealous and more meticulous in their religious observance that individuals bordering on their religiosity to privacy.
For example, non-Muslims see generally veils such as a sign of the administration and the inferiority of Muslim women.
Shame, however, it is changed to Muslims, a sign of their positive affirmation of an Islamic identity.
The young Muslim women in Europe illustrate the extent this transformation.
The girls who take the headscarves in schools in France and Germany are closer, in many ways (namely, the youth culture, the awareness of fashion and the language), of their comrades of class as their mothers uneducated who are forced to stay at home.
By adopting the headscarf for the European public sphere, these girls are unwittingly the symbol and the role of Muslim women.
This trend goes far beyond simple headscarves.
All Muslims in the West have a double sense of cultural capital, a double.
They define themselves by their religiosity, but they have also acquired knowledge secular universal.
The fact that they have the cultural capital, they can move relatively freely between the different activities and spaces (homes, schools, homes for young and space for leisure district).
Being a Muslim and be Islamist are two different things.
We are witnessing today to change a Muslim identity for an Islamic identity.
The view religious Muslims from the Kingdom individual private in the public.
The question that remains for everyone is whether this quest for identity can be satisfied with scarves and with a broad public acceptance of religious practice Islamist or if a positive affirmation of Islam requires a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.

A new era for the Islamic science?
For several hundred years, while the science and mathematics undergoing a period of great ingenuity, a region of the world differed from others.
The masters of these disciplines were celebrated, the medicine was fast and people are interrogeaient on the workings of nature.
It is no surprise that this region has been globally respected.
The other half the known world, scientists were punished, even killed.
The mathematics, regarded as irréligieuses and foreign, were outlawed, and were later subjugated to religion.
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous area was the Middle East Islamic, while an ignorant remained poor.
The two regions were governed religiously (historians disagree on the role and the nature of religions in this context), but science is épanouissait that in one of them.
Today, obviously, the roles of the Islamic Middle East and West are reversed.
Since the Second World War, the États-unis are the leaders of global indiscutés in science.
Throughout this period, the brightest students have been lured out of their home countries by the prospect of best career opportunities and research.
Until recently, more than half of students graduating from the higher in math, science and engineering to États-unis were born abroad.
Many of these young talents remained after receiving their diplomas, and both the industrial world that the government have benefited.
Meanwhile, Islamic culture walked into a historical period in which the science was comparable to the influence of the West, and running away from for this reason.
Even in countries where the oil revenue could fuel a significant proportion of research, the Arab leaders were not encouraged such investments, and the result is that their companies have not done well so they could.
Recently, a desire for greater respect policy has led the Islamic nations to invest in technology, which is most visible in the Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But while such weapons have a political clout, the science on which they build is banal and old.
The respect of visions well thought out, rather than those born of discoveries, is far more significant.
Imagine the effect that would have a Pakistani Institute at the head of global research into cancer.
And the political rhetoric changerait-elle if researchers to Oman, find a way to eliminate AIDS?
This opportunity is not looking at the moment.
But there is another, which is not confined to the Islamic societies.
The États-unis have committed serious stumbles recently.
"issues of faith" have substituted for science in government, from the presidency.
Leading researchers have seen their reports modified by members of staff policy when the facts contradicted the official version.
Encouraged by an administration influenced by religion, the school systems are turning their teaching science to the "values."
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, the entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, which hinders the flow of young talent to American universities.
Large organisations scientists have protested to no avail.
Meanwhile, tax laws have been revised to make investors more rich in the short term, discouraging long-term investment in research.
A demi-billion dollars was spent in the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the funding of any fundamental research of a thousand years.
Even if the États-unis avoid a dark age of fundamentalism, they are clearly losing their world domination in terms of research.
Japan has recognized the link between political weight and science in the 1980s.
The main industrial Japanese, Akio Morita, CEO of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shinzo Ishihara, made a series of speeches that have been compiled and released in 1986, under the Japan that can say no (Japan who can say no).
They have outlined a national strategy in which the global influence the result of the power of science.
The main idea is that military power could be made obsolete if "food chain" of military technology was controlled by other nations.
The title of the book refers to the project of Japan "say no to the American military influence once that Japan will master the main military technologies.
Build a knowledge-based economy thanks to the oil wealth is entirely possible.
Texas, for example, as most of the États south of États-unis, was once economically poor and on the decline.
Even with oil revenues, the flow of dollars in the economy, not in itself enough to boost prosperity as one might think.
Texas has therefore decided to spend the oil money to a funding for education.
Today, this budget is roughly equal to that of Harvard University, and it extends to 15 universities.
It was a staggering: the aerospace industry has almost disappeared from California, but it blows up in Texas.
The research centres and the telecommunications companies have rushed in Texas, until the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.
Although the industry in a crisis in the États-unis, Texas has one of the most solid industrial economies of the world.
There is no reason that the same results cannot be achieved in the Middle East.
But first, the Islamic world needs to rediscover and re-engage with its proud heritage.

The Iranian debate on Iraq
No country in the East is following the events of the postwar Iraq as closely as Iran.
Geographic proximity, intense and violent war with Iraq from Saddam Hussein, religious and emotional connections with the Shia in Iraq, some concern about the États-unis and their policy in the region: this is the son that unite Iran in its western neighbor.
Given the tension without end with America, Iran is particularly concerned by the possibility of an American presence continues in its neighbour, and by the dominant role in America in the construction of the future from post-Saddam Iraq.
Foreign observers can find it hard to follow the internal discussions Iranians, yet they exist, they are intense, even if they are not always visible to the international audience in general.
You can find three general approaches in the debate in Iran is constantly evolving in post-Saddam Iraq --.
The Iranian pragmatists argue that Iran will inevitably have to cooperate with the États-unis in post-Saddam Iraq -- even if only to ensure that the rights of the Shiite population of Iraq are respected.
For this reason, Iran should win the assurance that the new Iraqi leader will not be hostile, and will seek to win the bilateral friendship.
Other key considerations for the pragmatists relate to the preservation of Iraq's territorial integrity and the repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.
They are moderates who believe that the Iranian government should insist the États-unis to secure the extradition of members of the Organization of moudjahidins Khalq (MKO) based in Iraq and the dismantling of the organisation.
In exchange, the Iranian government should offer its support to ensure peace, stability and security in Iraq.
In sum, the pragmatists would limit the relationship between Iran, focusing on a programme which greatly reflects the concerns of Iran.
In general, the conservative forces of Iran support this approach.
Another approach is proposing a more active role and cooperative for Iran in Iraq's reconstruction.
Defenders of this position argue that Iran is well placed to facilitate the reconstruction, because of its infrastructure well-established personal and institutional ties with Iraq.
Finally, we believe, the États-unis and the international community will recognise the value of the cooperation of Iran.
The Iranian cooperation should be rewarded by the dismantling of the infrastructure of the MKO in Iraq, perhaps in exchange for a promise to tackle the activities of al Qaeda and to expel members of Al Qaeda in Iran.
Above all, Iran should urge Americans to meet its cooperation with the assurance of a guarantee in return that Iran does not become the target of US military actions.
In short, defenders of cooperation are calling for an open market and explicit: the support of Iran to ensure stability during the current phase of transition and its commitment to maintain relations with any permanent government will emerge in Iraq in exchange for improving the position of international and regional Iran.
This position is widely shared in the reform movements in Iran, inside and outside the government, and by the class technical and business approach is more international.
Finally, for Iranian hardliners, the possibility of cooperation with the États-unis is pure fantasy.
They are convinced that America is merely seeking to undermine the Iranian security and endanger its national interests.
According to the Radicals, the États-unis will seek to impose significant changes to Iran's foreign policy.
At worst, they say, America will seek to impose a regime change in Iran.
It militera enthusiastically against the acquisition of knowledge and nuclear energy by Iran and could even try to weaken the military capability of Iran in its entirety.
The Radicals, to see the American invasion of Iraq as a reflection of America's willingness to encircle Iran.
In return, they believe that Iran must take an aggressive stance in defending its interests, and form strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and use the Iranian influence in Iraq for preventing the formation of a government pro-American and anti-iranien in Baghdad.
Supporters of the hard line on all sides to support this approach.
The overthrow of Saddam and his regime was more easy to Iraq.
Now the hard left to do: establish peace and security, winning the war against terrorism and convince the Muslim masses that America has no intention to occupy Iraq but siphoning all its oil resources and redesign the Middle East to its image.
Meanwhile, the opposition against the États-unis under the expression of suicide bombings or other forms of terrorism, will probably grow.
Iran is intended to keep its dominant position in the region through his political momentum and its Muslim identity which echoed resonate throughout the Muslim world.
What happens in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the États-unis would do well to find a way to recognise that.
The American threat, or the discussions on another war, feeding the fire of resentment and frustration in Iran, strengthening the movements of the more radical.
If the États-unis want to avoid such effects, they must agree to limit their influence on its own radical, assuming that the American interests in Iraq are better protected through cooperation with Iran.

A way for Iraq
The situation in Iraq came to the point where everybody wants ostensibly the same thing: the departure of coalition forces.
The recent disclosure of a confidential memorandum from the Ministry of Defence of Britain on the withdrawal of troops has stressed that aspiration.
The only question is how the meet.
As the coalition forces will remain, violence will increase.
However, if they go, the escalation of violence will take place anyway, and even more quickly.
The real question is how to succeed in Iraq to organise an army and police who can be trusted to enforce the law and order.
There is a great way to approach this goal.
Despite the courage of many Iraqis who join the ranks of the police or army, this is not surprising that some have incentives to less than pure.
In northern Iraq, to settle old scores and ethnic segregation is introduced in some areas traditionally mixed, as Irbil.
In other regions, Sharia law is imposed.
How Iraq can create body likely to enforce the law with effectiveness and fairness, regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender?
The traditional response is to recruit, train and instil good values. "
But time is short.
We must find other ways.
In the absence of a system of deeply rooted, Iraq needs associations embedded in civil society, which police and army will have to account.
They could take many forms, but the most important is that they are really extensive locally, and that they have the support of the district authorities, the region and the country when they report abuse.
If a local surveillance is put in place, supplemented and recognised nationally, when most members of the military and police will no doubt appropriately, and otherwise, it will be easier to identify and manage them.
Such measures may be overly optimistic, and yet in Afghanistan, a country like Iraq in many ways, many groups are working together.
The cooperation for peace and unity (cpau) provides a model of how to operate.
In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the priority of ordinary people has been to reduce violence.
The cpau worked throughout the country over three years to put in place of the committees of peace in the districts, supported by the advice of peace satellites in the villages.
This initiative, faces a culture in which violence is so deeply rooted as children, at a time, learned the arithmetic accounting for the Soviet soldiers died.
The committees have tried to bring together all the groups in the community, including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, the police, judges and businessmen, in order to devise ways to resolve conflicts without violence.
Even if the committees was not officially a supervisory role to date (that is expected in the future), the fact that the police, army and justice in the places in contact with the rest of the community, allows for a return of information, and contributes to the establishment of trust.
Some results are remarkable.
In one of the workshops, the local military commander has come through a few hours by courtesy, and ended up staying for the whole week.
It is party in apologizing for his violent past and is committed to disarm its private army of 2,000 men.
It makes now regularly visit the offices of the committee.
In Iraq, projects such as the humanitarian links center of Kirkuk are starting to play a role in monitoring by offering to the people to different ethnic groups the opportunity to explain his grievances and to get help to solve its problems.
But too often, even in the case to trial, the judgment is not applied for the victims on the threat.
The US and British forces have already worked to strengthen civil society.
However, we do not hear talk of workshops for emancipation of women, or the success of the organization of local elections on a small scale in the country.
The civil society is a huge challenge, especially when, as in Iraq, it must be done quickly and at large scale.
The military forces are needed, but as well as encouragement to disarmament, which can take the form of prospects for economic opportunities more fruitful than the crime and theft.
Fortunately, such an organisation of civil society is so cheap that important.
The association humanitarian links Center treats all Kirkuk to an annual cost of $75,000.
With 10 million dollars, we could establish a hundred centres of the same kind, and there would still be the currency.
It is now to engage in this direction, without fail support the brave people who is the challenge to demand accountability on power.
À lacking, the Iraqi people may not be secure he desperately needed after years of suffering.

Democracy on the Nile?
The decision surprised the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment allowing holding direct presidential elections and competitive could well be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and in the Arab world.
The West used to a pluralist democracy can be difficult to understand what is potentially significant change this decision will result in a country used to military rule for more than 50 years.
Under the current system, the Egyptian citizens can only be the day of a presidential referendum held every six years to say yes or no on only one name on the presidential elections.
This explains why an individual such as Mubarak has always received more than 90% of votes, albeit in a turnout of indifferent.
The strong men Syrian and Iraqis have done even better with this system, perhaps because they have demanded that the names and addresses of the voters are placed at the bottom of each ballot.
Several people support for a long time that democratization in the Middle East will not move forward until Egypt will not get involved in the process.
Egypt could not really engage on a path to democracy without first amend its constitution, in order to reduce the powers a large-scale operation of its president and limit the length of his term.
Mubarak, after all, already is at its 24ème year as president.
Thus, its announcement of presidential elections competitive is a first major step.
The regime can assume it will be able to use the process to its advantage, but the events could prove more difficult to monitor that once people start to feel a responsibility.
The genius of democracy is out of the bottle.
In any case, Egypt is not alone in this troubled region to embark on the road to democracy.
Turkey on one side of the Middle East and Morocco on the other are already engaged in this process.
The real groundswell seems this time from the proximity of time and positive results of recent elections held in Iraq, Palestine and, to a lesser degree, Saudi Arabia.
The unprecedented demonstrations against the occupation of Lebanon by Syria following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, do not appear to ease.
The opposition groups Egyptians have also held marches more courageous and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks.
The catalyst of their anger has been the arrest and detention of opposition leader, Ayman Nour, sick in late January.
The vagaries of the government has reinvigorated the national movement Kifaya (which means "enough"), which demanded the end of the regime of Mubarak.
Suddenly, popular wisdom that the Egyptians are passive and are afraid to act has not appeared to check.
An alliance of local forces, regional and international unit against the tyranny of permanent exerted on the shores of the Nile.
The recent wave of popular pressure seems to have shaken the regime.
Only a month ago, muybarak disrupted the demands of constitutional reform in the taxing of "futile".
But, whatever the combination of events that led the turnaround, the initiative on the elections must be welcomed.
It is a necessary first step, although it is not enough to overhaul the political system stalled in Egypt.
The Egyptians are wary of symbolic reforms to the country in which the Tunisian President Zine El Abidin bin Ali, who occupies office for a long time, has created a caricature of constitutional amendment which appeared to pave the way presidential elections competitive, but which subsequently led to a show of support with a few "opponents ’ handpicked.
In previous presidential referendums Tunisians, bin Ali picked systematically 99% of votes; he has now reached 96%.
Hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform.
To prove his sincerity, it has ordered the immediate release Ayman Nour and take steps to end emergency rule for 24 years, which prevents the organization of political campaigns.
Mubarak must also approve a limit of two consecutive terms of five years for each president.
Just as necessary, measures to win the confidence of citizens, including open access and the media, which are currently controlled by the state.
I have announced that I had intended to contest the coming presidential election in order to open the debate on these reforms.
But I go home happy in my life of private citizen when I have assured of an election free and open next autumn.
If they are seriously implemented, these steps will turn the legacy of Mubarak.
With the events in Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine, they could very well to unveil a spring Arab freedom, waited for a long time.

Historic elections for the Égypte?
The Égyptiens will travel to the polls on 7 September to elect a president of 10 candidates, including Hosni Mubarak, in power for 24 years.
If little doubt that it will be re-elected at the end of the election, much to follow the steps with passion.
Some 6,000 national election observers have been trained for the occasion, and hundreds of international observers will come in the country this week.
Although all the trappings of a real electoral competition are put in place, it is striking that several signs of authenticity are missing.
Despite the promises of the opposite, the game are far from fair.
Mubarak has a disproportionate number of advantages: the recognition of the name, a virtual monopoly of electronic media are controlled by the État and nothing less than 85% of print media.
A week before the vote, some opposition candidates have not yet had the opportunity to broadcast a television campaign to Egypt.
All the members of the presidential election commission is appointed by President Mubarak, and the new electoral rules have eliminated all competitors.
Since 2000, a Supreme Court decision requires the 8,000 judges Egyptians to supervise the elections and certify the results.
It is a big step towards elections fairer, because the professional judges has remained relatively independent during the last half-century of grip on the executive power.
The Mubarak regime has had to use a variety of subterfuge to neutralise the Union of judges.
One of them was to push the definition of "justice" to include thousands of employees graduates in law, with no experience at the court but loyal to the government. It leaves little room to the real judges, because if they protest in boycotting their observation work, the task will come back again to the police of the infamous Interior Ministry.
And, in the past, the union of judges has done his job, with predictable results.
During the parliamentary elections in 2000, while the ruling party of Mubarak has not received approximately 38% of votes in areas controlled by the real judges, the results have managed to culminate in 86% when the presque-juges were responsible for observation.
This year promises to be very different.
In the spring, judges have held a house for nationwide and found that, unless the government gives them a complete independence and exclusive surveillance of the process of elections, they do not being the presidential poll (or parliamentary) to come.
September 2, they have put their final demand: the regime must allow groups to observe the elections, stop to amend the definition of judges in a legitimate election, and accept that no ballot leaves the presence of a judge legitimate without that its content to be counted, certified and postponed.
For now, it seems that the situation is hopeless, because the head of the presidential election commission announced publicly in the Egyptian television that he refused any comment by the citizens of elections.
Among the interesting developments, on the eve of the election, is a heated public debate on the issue: should boycott the election or go to vote?
Many opposition parties have urged their members not to protest against electoral rules that are highly restrictive Mubarak.
Moreover, the Muslim Brotherhood, regarded as the only opposition group with the weight in Égypte, pushing their supporters to vote according to their conscience but not to support any "governing oppressive and corrupt."
This is an unspoken but clear repudiation of Mubarak, head of État for 24 years.
Some 34 civil society organisations are preparing for thousands of young Égyptiens to monitor the elections despite the objections of government action.
These groups argue that if the regime has no intention of rigging the elections, even the presence of national and international observers should not pose any problems.
The response of the regime is to say that any external oversight is interference in the Egyptian sovereignty and national observers would be an affront to the integrity of judges.
The latter argument is quickly dropped when the judges voted in favour of observers of civil society.
As the Mubarak regime is frightened of the voice of internal and external that the challenge to hold free and fair elections, or that it is simply unable to remove the cheat within the party as it became associated with its operation, the current signs do not bode well on the ballot next Wednesday.
Meanwhile, for the first time the Égyptiens experienced exciting challenge to the tyranny, and take advantage of a whole new area of freedom.

The envy of dollar
The currency can play a vital role not only in commercial transactions, but also in the diplomatic and political wrangling.
When that happens, commercial transactions are becoming more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.
The politicisation of the money during the Depression of the interwar proved to be economically devastating.
But violent wars of the currencies were more recently.
During the 1960s, the international monetary order has become a political tug-of-war.
Every player had theories and explanations significantly different on the situation.
The Europeans, and especially the French, complained that the General Charles de Gaulle once described as "exorbitant privilege" of the American dollar.
The general and its monetary guru Jacques Rueff, argued that the United States used the dollar's status as a reserve currency most of the fixed exchange rate regime Woods to manage the deficits and pay their military adventurism abroad (at that time in Vietnam).
France has responded by calling for a monetary reform that would end the particular role of the dollar and tried to resuscitate the gold standard widely discredited.
The Europeans began a long discussion on the benefits of monetary union, which would allow them to compete with the dollar.
But the American view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.
Other countries could change their exchange rates and could preserve greater competition at the level of exports.
The American government is powerless against the yen undervalued, fueling the belief that the rest of the world used the dollar to attack the manufacture of America.
The Nixon administration has concluded that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in a world currency (monetary expansion so spectacular that other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rates).
The battles have long forgotten seem suddenly present again.
The world has more than a fixed exchange rate regime, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency, a kind of Bretton Woods floating.
For Americans, the role of reserve of the dollar is a potential threat, while for those not Americans, rather, it is another example of search néo-impériale US hegemony.
During this decade, China has taken Japan's place of the 1960s, preventing its exchange rate to climb to push the growth of exports.
It has made it the target of American complaints about unfair competition and efforts to impose an adjustment of exchange rates likely to deter the Americans to buy toys, equipment and clothing.
American manufacturers have estimated that the bra manufactured in China threatened the American way of life.
Meanwhile, Europeans (and especially the French) complains about the huge US deficits and the argument of Charles de Gaulle stating that the rest of the world pays for the wars of America is back in fashion.
Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a larger proportion of their reserves in euros, an echo of the failed attempt of the general to capitulate America by selling dollars against gold.
The 1960s ended by a collapse of the 'system' and a major financial turmoil, accompanied by a wave of inflation, prices for goods.
Everyone was hit and America's role in the world has been shaken.
A collapse similar to the moment should have a slightly different.
The system of floating rate is more stable and the costs of adjustment distributed differently.
The majority of Americans do not suffer much of the sharp drop the dollar as dealers foreigners must make adjustments in prices for the American market.
The Asian economies are developing vigorously and their central banks their rely on the United States.
They should continue the policy not to see their export industries suffered a sudden failure on the American market capital.
The United States will have more time to treat a current-account deficit, which does not turn out viable in the long term.
The regions that are economically dynamic of the world (North America and Asia) are linked by a pact that will ensure the continuity of the centrality of the American dollar.
The Americans will continue to accumulate debts because Asians are encouraging.
The repeal of the pact would be contrary to the interests of both parties.
It is not an American unilateralism because the pact requires a collaboration with Asia.
But for Europeans, who are excluded from the pact, it resembles a unilateralism monetary and economic.
Meanwhile, the supremacy of the euro on the dollar suffered European industrial exporters.
Europe is not able to the relief.
Europe will represent the biggest victim of the new clashes of currencies.
The answers pronostiquées in the 1960s (restoration of the gold standard or invention of a single European currency) does not seem more helpful.
A single currency has failed to provide protection.
The old version of the European reaction (what psychologists call "the envy of the dollar") will become only more vivid.
The European Central Bank will be invited to extend the monetary base, as if imitation of the dollar was the answer to all the problems manufacturers, and structural demographic that invading Europe.
But we should remember that Europe's problems do not come from the manipulation of currencies.
The protests against the new version of the monetary exorbitant privilege of America should be seen for what they are: a way to compensate for a real European impotence.
The envy of the dollar is therefore to disappear and will grow, the value of the international dollar disappearing without clearly harmful effects on people who can and use it.

An outbreak of policy.
The Americans, like the citizens of all the countries of the world, came to accept the fact that the policy plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public representatives.
Few of us are surprised (although some may be disappointed when a federal judge or a senior diplomat is appointed because he has managed a crucial test of loyalty to an important principle in the eyes of the party of president or prime minister.
But the science of the opinion of all, occupies a special place and on this point, the United States are starting to serve as an example of warning for the rest of the world.
The appointments scientists must be based on objective criteria for training, competence and performance.
Obviously, it is legitimate to ask a future secretary of the Health and Human Services (SSH) on his views on abortion.
But it is totally wrong to submit the shortlisted candidates to sit in the scientific advisory committees in tests of the political loyalty.
Similarly, belonging to the bodies at the scientific proposals, a process to scientific progress, will undoubtedly be shedding all the barriers that are unrelated to the professional qualifications.
Unfortunately, scientists in the United States facing more and more often these barriers.
During last autumn, the journal Science has issued several reports on the issue.
One of these reports on the massive replacement of members of the advisory committee of the National Center for Environmental Health, which is part of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CCC), without prior consultation with the director of the centre.
Similar cases have also been observed in the advisory committee on lead poisoning and prevention of CCC, the National Advisory Committee is Human Research Protections and the advisory committee on genetic testing.
The current outbreak of ideology, in which the advisory committees are dissolved then retrained with new members, and where the candidates are subjected to tests of loyalty, seems to be overtaken by some observers.
Representatives of the SSH referred to as a "fairly common practice".
It is not a common practice in America, or at least until today.
In all cases, the fact that the Bush administration to pass tests on the candidates for key posts in order to determine their compatibility with its "values" is not really worrying.
The development of the more alarming is the level of importance of ideological investigations, which can then come in areas previously immune to this kind of manipulation.
Indeed, the most revealing in this epidemic growing political may have affected the reworking of belonging to the section of study of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, which assesses the subsidies to the study of injuries occurred in the workplace.
The advisory committees could be vulnerable to an overhaul of occasional this type in the past.
After all, they have recommended the policies that politicians will take into account.
But the sections of study?
In October 2002, science has published an editorial by David Michaels and several of his colleagues.
Several of them were distinguished former officials who participated in some of the relevant committees and they have made a point of view valuable to the issue, based on their personal experience.
The article was a matter itself, but the consequences that we had were even more interesting.
It has triggered a flock of letters in which scientists pointed to similar experiences.
A candidate for the Muscular Dystrophy research Coordinating Committee of the National Institute of Health reported that an inquiry was carried out on it by a member of the White House.
Having been invited to make his views on the various policies of the Bush administration, which no one she had no link with the committee's work, she had to say whether she supported the president's policy on embryonic stem cells.
Another person to be displayed, a distinguished professor in psychiatry and psychology reported having received a call by the White House on his appointment at the National Council on drug abuse.
His partner has said it had to do an investigation on him to "determine if his views could embarrass the president".
According to Professor, a series of questions is ensuing, the representative of the White House taking a sheet of rating.
Example: "You have two to three; the president is opposed to sharing needles (for drug users intraveineuses) for moral reasons, whatever the result."
Then the conversation took a turn even more alarming.
The representative has asked the candidate if he had voted for Bush and, having received a negative response, he asked: 'Why do you not supported the president? "
This is akin to a dictatorship, and not a democracy.
The aim of the scientific advisory committees is to provide impartial advice and consider the political process.
There is nothing to gain, and much to lose, when a political result wanted is highlighted.
This is why the determination of research projects to support has always been a question to be examined objectively peer, and not by politicians.
In fact, the law that applies here (the law on the federal advisory committees, the federal Advisory Committee Act requires that the committees are independent and "not unduly influenced by the authority to hold the power of appointment".
US Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson and the office staff in the White House should set an example to the world.
They can do very easily: within the law.

Murder in Moscow
It is time to put an end to the myth that the "dictatorship of law" of Vladimir Putin has made post-communist Russia as saying little more law-abiding.
The killing of Anna Politkovskaya, one of the journalists among the best and most courageous in Russia, a woman who dared to put out the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin leads a dictatorship banal showing the ordinary contempt for the law.
It is time for the rest of the world to recognise it, particularly for Europe.
The German Foreign Office is preparing a policy on relations between Russia and Germany, which should ratify the indifference to the lack of respect for law shown by Putin as national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But the indifference of the reconciliation when it encourages Putin to pursue this path in the international arena, as demonstrated by its current campaign to strangle economically Georgia.
The murder of Politkovskaya was a grim sense of déjà vu: as in the days of glory of the KGB in Putin's Russia people disappear.
The murder of Politkovskaya was the third murder apparently policy in three week.
Enver ziganshin, an engineer in chief of BP, Russia, was killed by gunshot in Irkutsk on 30 September.
Andrei Kozlov, deputy governor of the central bank of Russia who led a campaign against financial fraud, was murdered on 14 September.
The fact that the Russian Prosecutor General Yuri tchaïka takes investigating the murder of Politkovskaya in hand, as it did to that of Kozlov, is not a source of hope, as would be the case in a real democracy if such a senior official is involved in an investigation.
In fact, the involvement of the highest levels of government in Russia is virtually an assurance that the murderer will never be found.
The murder of Politkovskaya, a sign particularly sinister when considering the fact that she had to harsh criticism for the Russian president.
In his articles for a few newspapers still independent from Moscow, novaïa by Gazeta, and in his books, "Putin's Russia: life in a Democratic leadership" and "a dirty war: a Russian journalist in Chechnya" Politkovskaya commenting on the abolition of the freedoms that sign the presidency of Vladimir Putin.
As the fate of old businessmen exile Boris berezovski and Vladimir gusinki, and the oil jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the fate of the enemies of Putin can take three forms: the exile, the prison or the grave.
I am not accuse Putin's government has ordered the murder of Politkovskaya.
After all, as an investigative journalist in the campaign, it was rabid lots of other people in addition to Putin, including the current prime minister of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov is not least, she accused of conducting a policy of kidnapping against ransoms.
But even if the associated with Vladimir Putin had nothing to do with the murder by ball of Politkovskaya in a lift of his building in central Moscow, his contempt for the law has created the climate in which the murder took place.
À the image of the murder of Thomas Beckett in Canterbury Cathedral for many centuries ago, the crime was committed with a strong conviction that the King would be satisfied.
Étant given what was Politkovskaya — the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and his policies — the government should ensure that he would come to nothing.
Putin's Russia has already lost 12 prominent journalists, murdered during the last six years.
None of these crimes has been uncovered, which would not be the case if the "dictatorship of law" of Putin was something other than a mere public relations strategy.
The six years since the arrival of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin was marked by deeply conflicting signals.
On one side, the world sees a young leader graduate to commit to modernise Russia, and particularly to bring law enforcement and legal practices on the international standards.
Of the other side, the president is content to watch without saying anything, while his former colleagues of the Russian security services of the FSB (the former KGB) does not protect those being assassinated, and even a number of cases of espionage notorious against journalists, scientists and environmental activists.
Among these "néo-espions" are the journalist Gregori Pasko, an expert on arms control soutiagine Igor, the diplomat moiseïev Valentine, the physicist Valentin Danilov and others.
The supposedly civilising influence that means being a partner, presiding over a G8 summit in St. Petersburg, for example, seems to count for nothing in the cabal of Putin's Kremlin.
Once more, contact with the West gave birth to another Potemkin village; Russia will present a facade of laws and democratic rules, but behind the scene of carton-pâte are the same butes arbitrary making the law.
Globally, the danger is that the lawlessness shown by Putin exports.
Near the borders Russia, a form of diplomacy criminalised is taking root.
Think of how Putin tried to rig the elections in Ukraine, and the allegations without cesses levelled and taken out against the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
Consider the breakaway regions as the Mavericks simply in Moldova and Georgia, which exist only because they have the support of the Kremlin.
Look at as the Kremlin is trying to sing its neighbours, threatening their energy supplies.
All the police know that when we ignore the behaviour of criminals, they only become more adventurous.
It is time that the world recognizes Vladimir Putin for what it is: a man who back Russia in the country of the shadows.
The world must now consider this old saying that tacet consentere videtur: who makes no mention agrees, and ask if it really is wise to make peace to the construction by Putin of a superpower energy when the law does not count.

A pipeline to strengthen the empire of Russia
Gerhard Schröder, there is less a month, was still German Chancellor has agreed to become president of the construction company of a pipeline from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea and Western Europe.
In many countries, Schroeder is easily accused the offence of conflict of interest.
His apparent moral failure is magnified by the fact that at the same time, Russia is threatening to cut gas supplies to Ukraine if it does not give in to demands tariff gas giant Gazprom, the property of État the Kremlin.
The strategic goal of Russia is obvious. Currently, not to distribute supplies to Ukraine also means that much of Europe will not supply, because most of the major pipelines crossing Ukraine.
Bypassing Ukraine, Poland and, of course, the États Baltic states, the new pipeline will increase the influence of the Kremlin which seeks new footholds in the region.
President Vladimir Putin and his government of clones of the former KGB will have to worry about the reactions of Western Europe when they decide how firmly put pressure on the neighbours post-communist Russia.
Europe should really give Putin of such a weapon imperialist?
Worse still, Russia must use the weapon to put the EU to have complete power?
A former German chancellor to take the leadership of the company that will give Russia a way to manipulate the European economy shows the dangerous complacency of Europe against the neo-imperialistic ambitions of Putin.
Of course, the Russian media are aware of the growing dependence of Europe by reports from Russia's energy resources.
They are going up to délecter. The Russian newspaper columnists have written "when we have built and expanded our energy trade with Europe, it should remain silent on the issue of human rights."
Putin is this position more indirect committing to pursue what he calls a "policy of independence."
Thus, wants to simply say that Russia must be "independent" of the concerns of Western democracies on ethics and human rights.
It may be that some European leaders truly believe that maintaining the prosperity of the EU for to be silent about human rights and other sensitive issues that the Kremlin.
Of course we have briefly to speak on the issues "trade," as the expropriation of Yukos. If the Kremlin had to pay our values and our critical to her -- as Chechnya bloodstained -- it seems that Europeans would prefer to hide that to tackle a potential increase in energy prices, or even a blockade, such as Ukraine is currently facing.
While Putin reorganize its court, submitting the Duma to its will, hopes to see Russia become more "European" should be abandoned.
Russia that Putin is building has gradually transformed. It has changed from its hopes of post-Soviet freedom to become a bulwark oil and gas for the new elite of the former KGB.
Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the director of the pipeline consortium led by Gerhard Schröder, is a longstanding friend of Putin.
Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Warnig, the director of Russian arms of the Dresdner Bank, is a ex-officier the Stasi, the former secret police in East Germany, and that he met Putin at the end of the 1980s when Russian president was a KGB spy in the GDR.
The Russians to accept a government formed by former KGB men, for which the lack of compassion and the refusal of dissent are the rule, reflects their depletion in the tumult of 20 years.
Now, the Kremlin believes that what is good for the Russians basis is also for the citizens of the independent nations. No mercy can be attached to the small country weak once Russia retains the means to intimidate them, to isolate and threatened to blockade of energy.
As a former head of État new Lithuania independent, I have often been faced with such threats.
The European Union has signed several agreements with Russia, including a "common area" of freedom and justice.
The Kremlin is very strong to pretend that idealism.
His control of eastern Europe has always been imposed on the basis of "treaty of friendship" and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were missions "brotherly."
But, look at how Putin flies in the area "common": an inhumane treatment of Chechens, imprisonment of the businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, harassment of foreign NGOs and the accused Yuliya Tymoshenko, one of the égéries the Orange Revolution, by the Russian military judges on the burden completely invented.
If the Europeans believe sincerely in their common area of human rights and freedoms, they must acknowledge that these values are not shared by the henchmen calculating Putin.
It is just to see Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
Is it conceivable that the homeland of the "red terror," countless crimes unpunished by the Soviet era and hands yet sales of the blood of Lithuanians to Caucasians can really help to combat the global threat brandished by Iran and North Korea?
It seems more likely that the cold of the Kremlin may exploit every crisis to increase their power of destruction and their influence.
For decades, the region to Europe where I come from was left at the mercy of evil.
This is why I cannot remain silent when Europe wherever indiscriminately in a new appeasement.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have learned in our history, behind every act of diplomacy with Russia is an imperial ambitions.
West Europeans, who have forgotten this history, should heed the warnings.
The dependence on Russia -- even if it takes the face of so-called charismatic "Gerhard Schröder -- can only lead us into a wall.

Iraq: the bullet against of ballot papers
When the Iraq war began in 2003, the Bush administration caressait ambitious projects: the image of Germany and Japan post-1945, a long and peaceful occupation was considered, during which the increase in oil production would ensure a growing prosperity in the democratic structures would be built up piece by piece.
The foundation should be a liberal Constitution or post-modern, with the insurance premium of 25% of seats filled with women.
Iraq currently has no peace, prosperity.
The constitution to be voted on 15 October, includes the 25% rule, but has nothing to liberal.
The disposition-clé (Article 2) stating that no law can contradict the undisputed laws of Islam "violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty, and prevent the legislation to meet international standards.
For example, the age of consent to sex for girls can be high above nine years ago because Muhammad himself had a wife of nine years.
It follows that of the girls of nine years ago are also adults in the criminal law, and below average for the death penalty, for example, conversion to another religion.
The Shia can use this clause to put their ayatollahs above the elected parliament, as in Iran, because they are allowed to determine the "laws," of Islam.
Foreigners and the few liberal Iraqis are concerned above all of this clause, but the Islamic opposition to the constitution, widespread among Sunnis, aims to other provisions: the exclusion of "saddamiste Baath party" of political life and the government, and the Federalist clauses that grant autonomy for Iraq's 18 provinces and allow them to join in regional governments.
The law of exclusion is a personal problem for the Sunni elite, which include thousands of businessmen, liberals, even of artists who, with few exceptions, were all members of the Ba'ath.
In theory, the constitutional ban could not be retroactive.
But in practice, the administrative laws are now being implemented in order to exclude the members of the Baath so-called 'top' in any form of employment, the government, which affects thousands of people.
Sunnis would without doubt the federalist if they were that the Kurds.
They know the alternative is not a return to centralism, but the secession of three provinces of Arbil Dahuk Kurdish majority, and as Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own Ministry of Finance, his army (the pesh merga), and its oil production around Kirkuk, Iraq's second-largest reserve.
The Sunnis reject this same federalism for Shiites because they see them as fellow Arabs, who have always agreed the law Sunni in the past and who will once again, unless they have their own government.
This is what would the new constitution, because the southern provinces - who have the main Iraqi oil supplies in majority Shi'ites could form their own regional government.
In the usual style of the middle east of the Sunni leadership disappointed and angry with the constitution now threaten to use violence.
But the federalism is not the only reason proponents of the Sunni leadership and the Islamists out deadly attacks.
Their opposition is more basic: they do not accept the principle of democratic government by the majority.
À place, they are trying to restore the rule of the Sunni minority.
For the Islamists, all the Shia deserve the death anyway, as apostates.
A Shiite leader Moqtada al-Sadr, has also opposed vehemently to federalism.
His supporters, mostly illiterate, are the poorest and most violent Shia slum in Baghdad and beyond, including the Mahdi militia "fought American troops in 2004, even when the Americans were protecting the Shia, Sunni attacks.
As a young priest derived its authority to his father, Ayatollah died a populist, al-Sadr faces opposition from the ayatollahs Iraqis living, which hold their ignorance and its violence.
Sadr cannot compete with them in terms of religious authority, he chooses to take a party arabe-nationaliste against them, noting that the senior Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Sistani, is not an Arab and Persian.
Similarly, he reminds his supporters that the El Hakim, who run the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri) and their militia "Badr" were involved in exile in Iran, which many fought from the Iranian side during the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war, until the Americans' bring them back. "
Al-Sadr is opposed to federalism because a regional government's Shiite obéirait to its enemies, Sistani and SCIRI, and, he says, would fall under the auspices of Iran.
To highlight his message, Sadr has sent his men to fight the Badr militia, with success in Baghdad, where the Mahdis abound, but not in Najaf, where Sadr is hated after the destruction that it has caused last year until his men were massacred by the Americans.
It was difficult enough to deal with Sadr the gangster. À now, a political calculation simple suggests he may be the main character to decide the outcome of the vote of the Constitution in October.
In order to reject the constitution and trigger new elections for a constitutional assembly, opponents have needed a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.
The Sunnis are likely to prevail in two provinces, but if Sadr ordered his followers of the slums of Baghdad to vote not with the local Sunnis, it will probably fall into the capital in the hands of opponents of the constitution and ensure its defeat.
As a political thug, Sadr is of course to sell.
Last year he was wanted for murder.
Today he seeks a recognition as a man of État, he wants the money, and, at least implicitly, the humiliation of Sistani and SCIRI.
It may well be proposals, and the negotiations may have even begun.
But some Shiites that attack with words and balls have thousands of armed men at their disposal and for them, it deserves that bullets in return.

The end of the secret.
Transparency is not always easy in the new democracies in Eastern Europe. This is what has discovered the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány, when a recording in which he had the lies of his government has triggered riots.
As the post-communist Hungary, Romania has tried to encourage openness and honesty in a society that used to be among the most closed in the world.
But the persistence of a culture of secrecy blew up corruption and abuses of power.
There are, however, a real shift toward greater transparency, recognised by the European Union which gave the go-ahead to Romania for membership in early 2007.
In addition to the implementation of what the EU is today for a "functioning market economy", the essential reforms in the political and legal, I have the burden, will increase the transparency and control of the funding of political parties to the reorganisation of the judicial system.
The judicial reforms are contributing to root out corruption.
Ministers and former ministers, politicians, judges, lawyers and members of the police, customs and other public bodies, and the heads of private companies, have been charged.
Moreover, new forms have been developed for the declaration of assets and financial interests by people in official functions in government, parliament, in public administration and local and in the judicial system.
The new arrangements of statement is the most detailed in Europe and, above all they are made public.
The progress of Romania are confirmed by a report published this month, according to which the people of Eastern Europe now have access to information the government as well as those of the established democracies.
The report transparency and silence, the Open Society Justice Initiative (available on www.justiceinitiative.org), even says that the new democracies are sometimes better than the old: some of the Romanian government bodies are more requests for information than their counterparts French or Spanish.
Specifically, 60% of the demands are met in Romania, against 31% in France and 24% in Spain.
Among the other person, you can quote from Peru and Mexico, two countries that have passed legislation on freedom of information in 2002, shortly after the Romania.
However, it is not always easier access to sensitive information in democracies in transition.
I have worked as a lawyer for the defence of human rights in the Helsinki Romanian, and we have often had to take the courts to demand information, according to the Romanian law in 2001 for freedom of information.
For example, when we have officially obtained access to data on the telephone tapping authorised by the attorney general, it has simply ignored the decision.
We have attacked the civil, and the judge has set a fine for each day of delay in the flow of information.
It is only when the media were interested in the case, the data - a number of interceptions allowed during the previous 10 years, people covered and duration of operations - have been made public.
Romania has finally started to turn its back to a past marked by the omnipresence of the Securitate.
I am now part of the government, and I realise that it is not always obvious to share information with the public.
But sometimes painful reforms are needed.
We would not have completed the economic and political reforms that will enable us to enter the EU without our policies to the examination of the public and without accepting the greater participation of citizens in the decision-making process that inevitably accompanies such an opening.
In fact, access to information has become a sine qua non democracy worldwide.
When the United States have adopted the Freedom of Information Act in 1966, they were the only, with Sweden and Finland.
Today, 65 countries have set up for such legislation.
In Romania, those who fought for the adoption of a law on freedom of information to take full advantage.
According to the study of the Justice Initiative, the people who come to the Romanian government receive without much difficulty information that it would have been unthinkable to communicate a few years.
Thus, the Romanian Ministry of Defence leaked the number of soldiers who died in 2003, and the circumstances (including 13 suicide, two deaths by gunshot, and two died in battle in Afghanistan).
Another example, the court of Bucharest has received a request on the number of judges have been the subject of a disciplinary procedure since the beginning of 2000, and the motives of possible sanctions.
The court has sent this request to the Supreme Council of the judiciary, who has given a complete answer: four pages listing all the judges punished, the grounds and the measures taken.
This process is the result and the engine of the pursuit of reforms.
The leaders have not always been very comfortable with the opening, and the battle continues for the most sensitive documents.
But in the formerly communist countries, the benefits of transparency are undeniable.
Yet the experience of Romania shows that official secrecy is always a threat, no country is immune, and only a constant vigilance can prevent it undermine the foundations of democracy.

Save the trees of life
Nobody can finish his day without having used a sideshow to the forest.
In a far more important than we normally believes, the paper on which is written, the water flowing from the taps, the drugs that we are treating, timber, and our homes and furniture are made all of the forest.
The forests are giving us the fresh air we breathe and are home to endangered species.
They also offer places of entertainment, which is becoming increasingly important in the complexity of our world.
About 1.5 billion people living in poor rural areas directly depend on forests for their basic needs in food and firewood.
However, deforestation continues.
Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares of forest, is an area almost as much as four times to Switzerland.
The irresponsible management of forests, exacerbated by regulations and government bonds too weak, and the markets that reward illegal logging all conspire to deprive the world of its most valuable forests and the greatest threat.
When the forests are beginning to disappear, a range of environmental, social and economic problems are generally, that affect us all in one way or another.
The island of Sumatra in Indonesia is a good example.
The companies of pasta and papers are endemic and unlawful destruction of forests that are home to the greater diversity of crops in the world.
It is highly likely that plants still unknown will disappear in the process as the endangered species such as the Rhinos and the elephant in Sumatra, and the orang-outang.
When the forest of Sumatra has disappeared, entire communities will also places of life without appropriate means or a decent save their lives.
The distortion that trade in illegal products and cheap products needed to world markets is because of difficulties for the people responsible.
Developing countries will lose $15 billion of tax revenues every year because of illegal logging.
Complicating the demand for wood for reconstruction following the tsunami of last year, has stepped up an application already unsustainable for the forests of Sumatra.
The dam in the Amazon and the Congo are subject to similar threats.
A recent study of the United Nations, the Évaluation ecosystems of the Millennium (em), shows that the forests and other important areas have a serious decline because of their mismanagement and will continue to disappear if serious protection measures are not put in place.
The information published by the Brazilian government show that deforestation of forest irreplaceable in the Amazon, the fact conversions, rose to 2.6 million acres last year, which brings the total area of deforestation in the Amazon to 17%.
But the battle against deforestation is not yet lost.
Various organisations, groups and businesses worried about the state of global forests are working together to reverse the phenomenon of deforestation and improve the management of forests.
So, for example, the World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank have helped the Brazilian government to launch an initiative intended to establish new areas of forest protection over 17 million hectares in the form of national parks.
The cooperation of the World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank has also prompted other partners to establish a trust fund to manage these protected areas in perpetuity.
Similarly, a meeting at the summit of leaders of countries in the Congo basin has allowed cross-border cooperation for the preservation of forests and their proper management.
All this has led by the following the release of $53 million from the Department of État of États-unis to promote the conservation of forests in Congo.
Since the first meeting of leaders in 1999, 3.5 million acres of protected areas have been newly organised in the Congo basin.
However, given the consequences of the Asian tsunami of December, the weight of the arguments made by the em and statistics on deforestation of the more critical, we must continue our efforts.
The World Bank and the WWF have recently promised to work on the reduction of 10% of the global rate of deforestation for 2010 and to work with the institutions of the public and private sectors to make ambitious conservation of forests.
Studies show that if the WWF Global forests are shared between different uses, including the protection of certain areas, business management responsible and the restoration of forest landscapes, we can sustain the global forest products while maintaining the environmental and social values are essential to our immediate future.
Business leaders, governments, civil society organisations should all play their role in achieving that vision.

The Saudis are fanatics?
The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question the prospects of survival of the House of Saud ruling and questioning whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive or not.
For some reason, it seems that the Saudi society has led to a course of violent bigotry that draws its inspiration in a religious orthodoxy.
The fact that 15 of 19 Pirates of the air who took part in attacks of 11 September 2001 against the United States were Saudis has crystallised a deeply rooted in the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.
In some respects, this perception is right, but it cannot be applied to the Saudi population overall.
Instead, it would be a serious mistake to assume that the Islamist fanatic defines entirely Saudi attitudes toward religion.
Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team to carry out a large-scale study of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and in Jordan.
Our results have produced a surprisingly subtle Saudi attitudes.
By comparison with the respondents from other countries in the Middle East, the Saudis were the less religious all in general, and their attitudes towards democracy and arranged marriages also indicate an underlying feeling down.
It is certain that in the four countries, religiosity is widespread, more than 90% of respondents saying collectively they believe in God, in a life after death, and in heaven and hell.
But the Saudis seem less religious than their co-religionists Muslims.
Sixty-two percent of the Saudis are described as individuals religious, compared with 82% of Iranians, 85 percent of Jordanians and 98% of Egyptians.
The Americans also appear to be more religious than the Saudis, with 81%.
This variation can partly be explained by differences across borders on the meaning of religiosity. "
For example, Americans can define religiosity differently from people in the Middle East countries, with perhaps a less pronounced attachment to the religious beliefs in Islamic countries.
This could also see some differences between the Muslim countries.
But the gap between the Saudis and the Iranians, Jordanians and Egyptians to another in terms of religiosity autodéfinie, is so great that he would challenge the widespread perception of a Saudi Arabia extremely conservative and religious.
Indeed, the actions are more telling than the words: Only 28% of the Saudis have said they relations in religious services weekly, against 27% of Iranians, 44 percent of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptians and 45% of Americans.
These findings, although contrary to popular perceptions of the Saudi culture, are less surprising that they do not appear.
Sociologists religion support for some time in an environment monolithic religious, or when the religious institutions are closely linked to the state, the religiosity of the population declines.
It is supposed to believe that when the authorities of the State apply codes behavioural rigid, people tend to rebel and from religious institutions officially confirmed.
There is hardly surprising that the Egyptians, Jordanians, who live in countries where the state does not apply religiosity, are more religious than the Iranians, or the Saudis, who must deal with the police "under" local supported by the state.
Even on the issue of marriage, many Saudis have expressed opinions surprisingly liberal.
Respondents were split almost evenly on the issue of arranged marriages, half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on the parental consent, 48% who saw the love as the basis of marriage.
Given the gender segregation and the dominance paternal firmly rooted, it seems to reveal a strong desire to individual choice most marked in what has always been traditionally a ruling family.
Finally, the Saudis are fervent supporters of democracy, contradicting once again the image spread of conservatism of Saudi Arabia.
On all the Saudis polled, 58% saw democracy as the best form of government, 23% were in disagreement and 18% have not.
The overwhelming support for democracy in a country without a history seems to contre-intuitif secular and nationalist.
In fact, support for democracy is more liberal attitudes that we have seen in Saudi Arabia.
Supporters of democracy tend to be less religious, secular, more tolerant of others, more critical of the actions of the public sector, and more concerned by the Western cultural invasion.
Beyond the data of the study, history has shown that liberal ideas are becoming more prevalent when a monarch despotic sway with the support of a religious institution.
A strong movement of liberalism, appeared at the end of the ninth century in Syria in response to the religious Ottoman despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid.
At the same time, a secular movement anti-clérical on behalf of constitutional politics has made its appearance in Iran, in response to the alliance between the shahs absolutist quajar and religious institution.
In light of the similarities between this history and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we should not dismiss the possibility of reform.
The study also suggest that the Saudis could very well require a more transparent and a religion less interventionist.

The museum European
At the end of the 19th century Asia accounted for Europeans, a source of inspiration art or the target of imperial ambitions.
Conversely, Europe was a symbol of modernity - for the Japanese Meiji -- or decadence -- for the Chinese.
A century later, thanks to the Japanese economic miracle, the Europeans saw at least a small part of Asia as a centre of technological progress, and rapid industrial.
Today, at the dawn of the 21st century, the mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia are changing dramatically, with the Asian economies booming and a European Union in full identity crisis.
Some Asian personalities, such as former Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, warning Europeans: If they continue on this track, their continent will soon have no interest for tourism and high-end real estate.
An influential Chinese businessman, who shares his time between Hong Kong and London, was even more precise.
He said a few weeks, at a private gathering together in Paris of political leaders and big business leaders: "you are becoming the third world countries. You are wasting your time with the constitution, the welfare state, the funding crisis of pensions, and you give the wrong answers to questions that you ask."
The idea that Europeans are in Asia in general, and China in particular, is more complex. It is adapting to a new competitor lucid respectable, rejected the ideologically pure and simple.
In mai1968, some French students come out to invent a new world dreamed of Mao's China, a country, however, plunged into a cultural revolution, senseless and brutal.
This fashion sense is the result of both the ignorance of the crimes of the Maoist regime, that of boredom felt in a prosperous society near full employment.
Today, their heirs to openly criticise the capitalist model.
China, once star entrenched anti-capitalist utopian revolutionary, has become the enemy libertarian feared by a new generation of utopian reactionaries who defend the status quo in Europe.
Students who have shown recently in the streets of Paris do not want to emulate the Chinese and Indians; they refuse the logic of globalisation and the abandonment of social achievements hard earned.
The European economic elites is very different.
They have understood that their ideas postcolonial tainted with nostalgia, that China and India would be large export markets and huge reservoirs of cheap labor, are obsolete.
These countries have become real competitors worthy of respect or admiration.
The quality, cost and delivery times - in the automotive industry, for example - are now reaching the European level.
Europe still has an advantage in the scientific disciplines, as in the pharmaceutical industry, but new businesses very efficient, especially in India, are increasingly recruiting graduates MIT and Harvard, and -- thanks to labour costs are still lower -- to remain competitive globally.
Unfortunately, if the European leaders have become aware of the Asian challenge, they have failed to translate that into a lesson of realism, in a context of globalisation, or in a call to arms in the social and economic.
In fact, European politicians, with few exceptions such as Tony Blair, have been too slow to adapt to changes fulgurantes in Asia.
Without long-term strategy, and obsessed with short-term interests, the European politicians - unlike the business leaders - have not won the respect of their Asian counterparts.
Is that, on a continent that has not managed to bury the past and to end the spectre of nationalism, the EU is also a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.
But this image can survive a further decline?
For the Asians, the European model could become a political version of Venice: a place that you visit with the nostalgia of greatness, as an admirable Museum.

Red and Blue
The appointment of Condoleezza Rice in the post of secretary of État American replacement of Colin Powell shows that the recent presidential elections have yet to powerful effect.
It is important for Americans but also the rest of the world understand what these elections we reveal of America.
The presidential election this year shows that the American démocracie is healthy, and that some things get to be improved.
Unlike the election of 2000, when President Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely won the vote of the electoral college, Mr Bush has won 3.5 million votes this time.
While some Democrats are bitter, the legitimacy of the victory for Mr Bush cannot be challenged.
America is deeply divided between the États red, Republicans and the États blue, Democrats.
If 100 000 votes had stumbled into the red État Ohio, John Kerry would become president (despite a popular vote minority).
The electoral college was incorporated in the US Constitution to protect small États in the federal system and that means today that the election campaign will focus largely on a dozen États at most, battlefield where public opinion is closely divided.
Basically, there is something incredible in the election of Presidents without popular majority.
So it is time to discuss amending the constitution to abolish the electoral college.
Some observers are complaining about the rhetoric and negative advertisements to sow discord that have characterized this campaign.
This must be assessed in a historical perspective.
At the time of the founding fathers, newspapers were easily party and George wahsington was dismayed by the severity of the language policy.
For most of its premium history, without mentioning the civil war and the period of reconstruction, the country was also closely divided as it is today and the bitter rhetoric of the countryside has always reflected this competition close.
However, despite the negative advertisements on both sides, the three national debates televised raised important questions in a format seriously and have been widely followed.
In general, first president with economic growth is likely to be re-elected.
The real surprise in the re-election of Mr Bush was the low margin of its majority.
In large part, this is due to the unpopularity of the Iraq war.
Kerry has tried to turn the war, the low rate of job creation, the medical coverage and tax credits of Mr Bush to the class favoured central issues in the campaign but some observers have felt that it fails to send a clear message.
Mr Bush has been drawn up with the issue of security against terrorism and a cultural populism on issues such as the gay marriage and abortion.
Finally, populism cultural and security have won against the economic populism.
The interpretation of the elections was influenced by the polls exit polls in which voters must decide (having voted) on the issues that ontle more running out for them.
The majority (22%) said the "moral values", by comparison only 20% have cited the economy and 19% terrorism.
Social conservatives have interpreted this to mean that they had won the election of Mr Bush and that their programme was to dominate his second term.
However, a Pew poll carried out a week after the election indicated that the category of "moral values" embrace a variety of issues in more rights to abortion and gay marriage.
In fact, polls show that 25% of the public supports gay marriage and 35% are in favour of civil unions law of gay couples (a position that defended Mr Kerry).
However, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage in particular in the États soft centre, the issue has enabled us to rally supporters of Mr Bush to make them come to the polls.
Still, overall, if the United States are divided beyond any hope.
The electoral map of États red and blue gave birth on the Internet of jokes and humoristiques designs on the secession of two blue coast with the red centre.
Some appelent this "côtopie."
But the divisions are not so clear.
In both camps, many États were won by a small room and if we Colore cards by County rather than État, most of the country turns Violet.
Cities against suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of coast against Hearts.
Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are focused on the moderate middle of the political spectrum rather than the two extremes.
But the political elites, such as political activists and members of Congress tend to be more extremists that the public.
At first, this seems odd, since they should feel attracted by the centre, rich in voice.
However, many members of Congress represent districts that are granted to their party and the real threat to their re-election is the party primaries, dominated by the wings of the more militant and extreme parties.
This trend is reinforced by the rise of the cable TV, which draws viewers through more controversial plans to info-divertissement, and those who called chronic Internet blogs, starting in the controversial persistent, without any editorial filter.
A reform that would change the borders of congressional districts to make them more competitive permettrer to respond to this problem, but few members will vote for such changes that could increase the risk of their defeat.
The narrow margin of the results suggest that Mr Bush does not really the mandate of change that it believes have won.
Faced with difficult issues in foreign policy, fiscal and dociale, it would be wise to turn towards the centre rather than to reconcile its conservative base, but the policy that will prevail between conviction or the pragmatic policy remains uncertain.

Use of oil!
Chancellor Angela Merkel has made the fight against global warming the priority of German presidencies of the European Union and the G8, which began in January.
Its concrete proposal is enough for leaders to take into account and accept, and quite clear that other governments and companies understand: at the next G8 summit, it will simply set a date from which vehicles running on petrol will not be registered in the major industrialised countries.
This decision will take a considerable positive impact at geopolitical and economic.
Today, the real concern in energy is not linked to the reduction of world oil reserves, but rather the decline of internal production of the biggest consumers -- Europe, America and China -- even as the growing demand in Asia on the market.
The reserves available will focus more in the Middle East, because those in other parts of the world will soon be dry.
Moreover, the major oil exporters are not prepared to submit their investment policies to market conditions.
Saudi Arabia wants to manage only its oil production and, for its part, Iran is afraid to potential investors with its bureaucratic obstacles and corruption.
Iraq is a lack of security, while the foreigners are thwarted at every attempt to investment in Russia.
These four États contain half of global oil reserves, two-thirds of which could potentially be exported.
These factors, except the production costs, are the cause of high oil prices and the race for the contracts in Africa and Central Asia.
The belief that rising oil prices is good for the environment does not take account of the basic data of international politics.
First, in most poor countries of Africa and Asia, the import of oil is a larger part of national spending in the industrialised countries, which means that economic growth and social development are compromise, and that new crises of debt.
The pensions of oil production are hampering the reforms in the main exporters.
Thanks to increase their financial muscle, as those of Venezuela and Iran are feeling less constrained by the international rules.
The latest arrivals among the major consumer countries, such as China, the old habits of the developed West and their long tradition of blind to the human rights violations in order to secure lucrative contracts with the authoritarian regimes and rich in oil.
Only the political and economic heavyweights, industrialized countries which are by far the largest consumer of oil can start a change in the world.
It is important to begin with the transport sector, which currently accounts for more than half the consumption of oil -- a level which will certainly in the future.
Therefore, the G8 countries will agree to register new cars travelling at the petrol from 2025.
This decision is not directed against the individual, but against the waste of a scarce resource to serve as a priority to produce synthetic materials.
Politicians should not promote such and such technology.
Instead they should encourage the car industry to develop alternative technologies that use biofuels, the éthylène, hydrogen and even natural gas, for a period of transition.
The countries that have opened the door to the political will here, as a side benefit, the national industries in first place in energy technology to ensure the future markets.
The expected reduction in CO2 emissions could ultimately lead to progress from the international policies on climate.
The economic development is also at stake: If we soignons our "dependency" on oil, the poor and less developed and the new industrialised countries, could be more, which would bring down prices and calmerait competition.
On the geopolitical benefits are all too obvious, particularly the major oil exporters would be less able to sing the industrialised countries.
This change would increase the strength of negotiating the international community in the Middle East and strengthening the social forces countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia, who want to seriously promote economic and political reforms.
A large producer car and the advanced technology, Germany is well placed to launch such an initiative.
Angela Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics and began his political career in the post of minister of environment "in 1995 -- the first conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change -- would be more credible than any other members of the European Union and the G8 summit to tackle the problem.
It is time to perform an act of bravery.

The myth of humanitarian aid and trade
Humanitarian aid and trade have become the words.
Increased humanitarian aid (accompanied by a debt relief) and better access to markets in rich countries for the products of poor countries: It now seems to have taken the top of the international agenda.
In fact, the debate today is no longer on the measures, but on the quantity of measures to take and how quickly.
Lost in all this: the lessons to learn the last five decades of economic development.
At the forefront of these lessons, we find that economic development is left largely in the hands of poor nations themselves.
The countries that are nonetheless done pretty well in recent history have succeeded thanks to their own efforts.
Humanitarian aid and the markets have played a minor role.
Take the example of a developing country which has a free and preferential access to its larger neighbour, who also happened to be the most powerful economy in the world.
Suppose that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border, receives a huge volume of foreign investment and is fully integrated into the international production chains.
Moreover, the country's banking system is supported by its wealthy neighbour and his willingness to intervene as lender of last resort.
Globalisation would come in better auspices that some of it?
Consider a second country now.
It is facing a trade embargo on the biggest global market, does not receive foreign aid or any form of support from the Western world is excluded from the international organisations such as the WTO and cannot borrow from the IMF and World Bank.
If these handicaps outside were not sufficiently debilitating, you can add an economy that interview itself barriers against international trade (in the form of trade in État, barriers to imports and restrictions).
As was able to guess the reader, they actually exist: it is Mexico and Vietnam.
Mexico has a long border of 3 miles with the États-unis, which offers not only the privileged access to a market of goods and labour, but also a proportion of the US Treasury (as the experience of the peso crisis in 1995 has shown).
However, America has maintained its trade embargo against the Vietnam until 1994, has not restored diplomatic relations before 1995 and has not granted the status of the nation most favoured the Vietnamese imports that many years later.
Vietnam is not yet entered the WTO.
A look at their economic performance.
Since the signing of NAFTA in December 1992, the Mexican economy has experienced an average annual growth of just over 1% per head.
Not only this figure is well below the rate of the champions of the Asian economy, but it is only a fraction of the performance of growth capital in Mexico for decades before the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam, however, has seen an increase of 5.6% since the early stages of its economic reforms in 1988 and the restoration of diplomatic relations with the États-unis in 1995 and has experienced rapid growth continued at a rate of 4.5% since.
Vietnam has witnessed a dramatic decline of poverty while Mexico has suffered a fall in real wages.
These two countries have experienced a takeoff out of international trade and foreign investment, but the picture is very different where it matters most: in improving living standards, particularly among the poor.
What these examples demonstrate is that the efforts of domestic overshadows all the other elements in the determination of the economic fortunes of a country.
The American market had to offer in Mexico has not been able to offset the impact of policy mistakes on the internal market, particularly the inability to overturn the real appreciation of the exchange rate of the peso or extend the productivity gains achieved in an area close to export business to the rest of the economy.
What matters most is the adoption by a country a strategy for growth.
Without the benefits, which many Mexico, Vietnam has pursued a strategy countered in diversifying its economy and improving production capacity of local suppliers.
The overall experience of the postwar bolsters evidence that the domestic policies are what matters most.
South Korea took off in the early 1960s, not when foreign subsidies were at their height, but when they began to dry up.
Taiwan has not benefited from foreign aid or privileged access to certain markets.
China and India, superstars economic time, have been very successful with their own efforts of economic reform.
It is trying to put on account of foreign demand for their products for export the rare success in Africa, Botswana and Mauritius (respectively diamonds and clothing), but this can go very far.
Évidemment, these two countries would be much poorer without access to foreign markets.
But, as in all cases of successful development, which the exercises are not outside the benefits they enjoy, but their ability to exploit these benefits.
It is enough to see how other countries have marred the advantage that their purchase their natural resources.
The word 'diamond' is not particularly come to mind an image of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
Similarly, few zones of exports proliférant across the world have seen the level of development that we see in Mauritius.
It emerged, however, not the rich countries from their obligation to help.
They can make life harder for corrupt dictators, sharing more financial information and refusing to acknowledge the international contracts they sign.
Similarly, increasing the number of workers in poor countries allowed to work in rich countries and a wider range of policies that focus on growth thanks to the relaxation of rules and conditions of the WTO imposed by the États-unis would produce a greater impact on long-term development.
It is not proven that the expanded access to markets and subsidies, represents the best use to make the political capital of the Northern Hemisphere.
The development should focus on improving the political environment in poor countries, rather than on aid and trade.

Interdependence
If the great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today, there is no doubt that he would take if the world is set to turn round.
His theory widely influential dependency argued that if the poor countries had relied too much on exports of raw materials, they could never happen the industrial levels necessary to sustain rapid growth.
They are embourberaient instead in a round of global decline in commodity prices and reducing the proportion of income.
The answer to Prebisch favourite, protectionism, has been disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that have followed.
But the fact is that for years, Prebisch seems to have had the reaction just about trends in commodity prices over the long term.
The permanent efficiency gains in the agriculture and the extraction of natural resources have been lower commodity prices, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.
À a few exceptions, the countries that have focused on exports of raw materials have been poor results, while the Asian countries with few resources have made rapid progress.
Today, however, with the Giants in Asia, India and China, joining the world economy, prices of petrol, gold, wheat and virtually all other raw materials are soaring.
Yes, there will always be rounds (the price of oil, for example, will no doubt again before starting his rise) but the long-term trend many raw materials will remain clear for some time yet.
What many trade negotiators and other policymakers have not seemed to acknowledge, while Prebisch would have understood immediately, it is that this sudden U-turn has huge implications for the global balance of powers.
Indeed, any other aspect of economic globalization is giving greater challenges to the leaders of the world over the coming decades.
There are many questions.
Today's rich countries prepared to enter a period of co-dépendance, in which they will be equally desperately seeking raw materials that developing countries are industrial products and technologies?
Are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence countries to the producers of raw materials as they will certainly?
How the two superpowers of the world, China and the États-unis, will manage the fact that significant exporting areas of raw materials in Africa and the Middle East into Central Asia are covered by États-nations poorly trained?
Some of the prophets self-appointed expose the problem as the limits of nature reserves and claim that the most critical raw materials are shrinking at an alarming rate.
Nowadays, many are followers of the theory "of the peak of Hubbert 'production of oil, which supports that we have reached the limits of our production capacities, the wells are drying up and that the situation could deteriorate.
However, as indicated by the eminent historian Dan Yergin oil, the prophets of doom have boasted that the resources in black gold were about to receive at least four times already.
À each time, radical technological advances have made to take off these threats.
À the late 1800s, oil drilling meant to draguer with mulets.
Today, drilling to 3,000 metres below the soil of the oceans is natural to everyone.
Such moves have also been made in the areas of the extraction of metals and agriculture.
No, the world is not facing a shortage of raw materials.
In reality, it happens that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India) in the world economy produces a shift in demand likely to put more pressure on the rise in commodity prices that no gain technology might be able to balance.
Therefore, at least 50 to 75 years, and perhaps even until people start to drill on March over the centuries to come, the prices of many natural resources will rise.
The new balance of economic forces that would result in it will destabilise the political situation?
The first world war was partly triggered by concerns in Germany before grabbing the other colonial powers of too much of the world's oil and raw materials.
Similarly, during World War II, Japan has feared for the stability of supplies in deals and other natural resources from abroad.
Such tensions will be between China Resources uncertain (even the scarcity of water is a problem there) and the West?
Fortunately, this does not seem likely for the moment, particularly in light of the approach as sober as practical problems of resources to their country displayed by the Chinese leaders.
The Chinese are turning to regions like Africa in the hope of finding trading partners stable.
They do not share the political evangelism of Americans who do not want only to trade with commodity exporters, but also want to convert.
Then there are those American leaders who still talk about making the États-unis self-sufficient in terms of energy resources.
This is a joke: enough, perhaps, but auto-suffisants, ever.
Much of the Arab world view, and it is understandable, the invasion of Iraq is the cornerstone of the US strategy to get hold of energy resources stable.
If they are right, we can only hope that America has a fallback.
Meanwhile, commodity prices will continue to grow, and oil exporters constitute the biggest contributors to the yawning trade gap of États-unis.
Perhaps the real American strategy is to try to the oil exporters so much money that they will become dependent on the happiness they provide to America!
This is a turning point that Prebisch would never have expected.

The choice of Iran
The choice of Iranians to bring to power the mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, risk of deteriorating relations with the West and increasing isolation of the country at international level.
However, in terms of national policy, the Islamist regime will probably better than if a candidate is more moderate prevailed.
It is clear that Ahmadinejad has a real support base.
The fact that it was presented as a populist, he has talked to help the poor, condemned the government and acted almost as an opposition candidate does not count: it embodied the choice of the regime, and eventually receive an official aid including against rivals radicals.
The regime has shown great skill.
It has transformed the candidate a little more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, disagree with some government policies, in person in harmony with the established order, and its own candidate in a rebel.
The government has used the resentment against the establishment to consolidate his own power.
Étant given that the former president Mohammad Khatami, argued the reformist movement, to me if there was little foolhardy and that it has finally done nothing, it makes that point to how leaders have returned to their advantage in the political situation.
Ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists of the revolution anti-shah for 25 years ago.
It is directly involved in the American hostages in Iran, though it really does not know at what point.
The most worrying is that it is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements of Iran: the body of guardians of the Islamic revolution and the Basij.
The first is an army parall to the pro-régime; the second is an organisation which will intimidate opponents and anyone who is seeking a more open society.
However, this concern that Iran is in the hands of leaders even more radical is mixed by two factors.
First, Ahmadinejad will likely focus on probl to my national, and try - with no indication of its chances of succ to - to improve the lives of Iranians the poorest.
Second mement, the group in power since the revolution will continue to lead the ideological and political étrang to consider.
The president has less power than it sounds, and it is particuli surely dwarfed by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Nevertheless, the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad makes CR to lying to the challenge that Iran poses to the Western policy and the stability of the Middle East.
First, it sends the signal to the more extreme elements of Iran and customers terrorists in this country -- the Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and several smaller groups who are working against Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Arab countries -- they have the go-ahead to launch their attacks.
They will probably assume that Iran will support them, although they do.
Apparently, Iran has often shown relatively cautious, while playing to cover the role of global financial backer of terror.
Iranian officials who were able to act individually, to command and coordinate operations, will feel more free to act as well.
In addition, Ahmadinejad openly advocates an intensive programme for obtaining nuclear weapons.
Most politicians in Iran, especially those that the government allowed to act, supports this programme, but a more discrète and cautious.
Rafsanjani, for example, puts the establishment of better relations with the West before the breakthrough on the nuclear front.
If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran, it is more likely to use weapons in a haphazard.
This does not mean that he would use, but rather than he would serve for purposes of blackmail diplomatic, making up the threats to the levels of crisis.
Since that Iranian leaders proclaim daily their desire to wipe Israel off the map and combat the États-unis (Ahmadinejad landed on the image of an American flag going to vote), the risk of confrontation has increased.
Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to enhardir to the point of endangering the stability of Iraq, and his victory will encourage Iranian officials radical and extremist Iraqis.
Iran is already many agents in Iraq and supports clients who seek to transform this country in clone.
The Iraqis, including the Shiite Muslims, who follow the M at version of Islam that the Iranians, who generally such interference.
An Iranian position more militant could increase the friction with Iraq, and inspire more violence anti-American.
In short, the outcome of the Iranian elections is dangerous, to me if his potential will depend on the actions of Ahmadinejad and the degree of power that will Khamenei.
In addition, dealing a Iran also openly radical extremist - to me at the Crit to res of a system already hard -- will be a challenge not only for the États-unis, but also for Europe.
The European countries will continue to claim that the rhetoric of militant and provocations of Ahmadinejad does not count and that it is possible to find solutions diplomatic overtures to Iran's nuclear ambitions?
With Rafsanjani, a real agreement, or at least the appearances of cooperation would have been easy to maintain.
But, with Ahmadinejad, it will take a huge dose of conciliation to keep even the most minimal diplomatic procedure.
Some reformists and Iranian exiles welcome the election to Ahmadinejad, because they believe that his administration is more likely to show the true face of the regime and prove any hope of compromise of the West.
But it can also embody the succ to the regime to return to his advantage the discontent caused by a quarter of whether to clear of GNE Islamist radical.
Whatever the consequences, the victory of Ahmadinejad means for the West that everything in Iran will become even more sensitive.

Take the poor, give the rich
President Bush seems about to destroy the US budget for the coming years.
When President Bush took office, the forecasts anticipated the budget surplus as long as you could imagine.
Today, thanks to a mixture of tax cuts are irresponsible initiated by Republicans, an economic slowdown, the bubble of the stock market and a massive increase in military spending, the fiscal outlook is dominated by large deficits.
The worst is still to come, because the Bush administration and congressional Republican majority are preparing for the fiscal mess.
The devastation that they will probably be lessened the États-unis and increase instability in the international economy.
Usually, America's Republican Party had balanced budgets.
That changed with the Reagan administration, when conservative Republicans were in favour of tax cuts, even when it was done through large budget deficits.
President Reagan announced the American people that he could enjoy both tax cuts, the strengthening of the Army and the continuation of their favourite spending programmes.
The result, unsurprisingly, was a series of significant budget deficits and the elimination took several years.
President George Bush senior and president Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to bring order to chaos of the Reagan era.
These tax increases have probably contributed to the defeat of President Bush's father by Bill Clinton in 1992.
However, Clinton decided bravely to finish the process to restore fiscal balance, in part to protect the long-term funding programmes for the pensions of social security.
Clinton quitta the presidency in 2000, the situation was at best for decades.
Then came President George Bush's son, ready to play the Reagan with significant tax cuts, a considerable increase in military spending and the continuation and even the development of spending programmes.
The result was predictable.
In January 2001, the cumulative budget projections for the years 2002 to 2011 anticipated a budget surplus of $5.6 trillion.
Mid-2002, these surpluses anticipated had evaporated.
À light of these new economic conditions, and in the shadow of the war against Iraq, one might expect that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress should be careful in defence of new tax cuts.
But far from it, their main priority is to build more tax cuts, where only the wealthy will benefit in large part.
At the same time, the government calls for large increases in military spending.
With the approach of the presidential election in November 2004, you can be certain that no significant reduction in spending will come in the programmes.
So it seems that the massive budget deficits are intended to continue.
If the domestic spending remains just constant, at a fraction of national income, the cumulative budget projections for the next ten years is anticipating a total deficit of $1.5 trillion.
But this figure could be very optimistic, because it is probably not the cost of a likely war against Iraq, or another package of tax cuts, or the risk of rising interest rates for the coming years.
Why the Republicans are montrent-ils if little affected by this mess?
Some Republicans worry more tax cuts for the wealthy than anything else.
Others believe that the deficits will lead by force of significant government spending at home, thus reducing the participation of the État, which is their most cherished hope.
The problem of this analysis is that most of the taxpayers are attached to the social programmes and will not support easily large cuts in spending.
The most intriguing remains as to why Americans vote for such policies when they should know that it will probably problems.
One of the possible answers is the fact that many voters do not come the budgetary problems.
A better answer is that most Americans did not actually voted for these policies.
The turnout of the election in 2002 was only 40% of voters, and only around half of these 40% voted for Republicans, approximately 20% of people entitled to vote.
Of course, the prospects are not necessarily be so gloomy.
The Iraq war might be avoided.
Tax cuts afoot could be moderate or abandoned.
But I predict huge budget deficits for years to come and a growing sense of unease within the États-unis and abroad about the macroeconomic situation of America.
Foreign investors might decide to reduce their funding from the government budget and the current deficit of America in terms of support.
The dollar may wane, and the fear of inflation could become even more pronounced.
It will lose confidence in politicians of États-unis which will be less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.
The poor, the États-unis and abroad, could suffer the most, since President Bush and Congress say the American people and the world that there is no funds available to address the question of poverty, health and education, the fact the huge budget deficits.
If the average American does not open the eyes on the risks of taxation, the wealthy could benefit from another gift of several billion dollars while the country and the world should bear the harsh consequences for the coming years.

Lessons to learn of the America's tax.
George W. Bush has done far more to destroy the economic policy of the United States that all the other presidents in American history, surpassing that his mentor, Ronald Reagan.
In just three years in office, it has destroyed a political consensus fragile who had asked for ten years of effort and who might need another decade to be rebuilt.
In doing so, Bush has risked the economic health and social stability in the long term of America.
Given the budgetary challenges in the long term that manage the US by an extremely awkward are not the only existing challenges, the Tax blunder of America offer important lessons to other countries.
The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily be temporarily popular by lowering taxes and increasing government spending while accumulating massive public debt and leaving their repayment to the future elected representatives.
The trick can last a few years, but the budget deficits and mounting public debt needed sooner than a change of policy.
A cynic, however, can buy his re-election and perhaps be party to retire when the crisis comes.
You might think that after decades of episodes similar irresponsible policy in the world, voters would be allergic to this type of ruse.
However, Bush applied again by buying a popularity by handing out massive tax cuts while simultaneously increased military spending and spending on education and health.
The budget deficit reached amounts to more than 5% of GDP.
Worse, the long-term budgetary outlook of America were already worrying before Bush begins to enforce its policies foolhardy.
The American population is ageing, so that the costs of pension systems and health care funded by public money will increase dramatically.
Detailed calculations show that the revenue that will be available through the fiscal policies advocated by Bush may not achieve the dozens of trillion dollars, which represent the costs of pensions, healthcare and other fiscal spending expected by the population.
At some point in the future, it will greatly increase the recovery of taxes, drastically reducing public spending, or both, to compensate for the actions of Bush.
So why the population support his policies?
Because it contains little these long-term consequences, or that she is concerned, even if the consequences will eventually have an impact on the majority of Americans.
The richest taxpayers are of course happy because they have enjoyed the bulk of tax cuts.
Strangely enough, the richest 5% of US taxpayers have had about half of the tax cuts and wealthy taxpayers are clearly that the other 95% (the middle class and the poor) are the majority of future spending cuts and tax increases.
Meanwhile, Bush has convinced many poor voters and voters in the middle classes that they should also be satisfied with their fate, without saying they will have to pay their small tax cuts by cuts far larger future government services, if the policies of his administration to prevail over the long term.
If the Americans had a memory, they would realize that they have already gravi this "roller coaster" tax in the last 20 years.
Ronald Reagan also took office promising massive tax cuts and huge increases in military spending.
It has ended in an enormous budget deficit in the mid-1980s.
The Reagan tax cuts have been extremely popular and have allowed him to be re-elected in 1984.
He then had a decade (from the second term of Ronald Reagan until the mandates of George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton) to return to a budget surplus.
Of course, this result has required the approval of new tax increases, which has lost his re-election to George Bush Sr. and resulted in the polarized in the 1990s.
History is likely to repeat itself.
Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration estimates that the current budget deficits will ultimately a drastic reduction of social costs of government.
They hope to dismantle programmes such as Social Security and Medicare.
But the American people strongly supports these social programmes.
The strategy that is first to cut taxes in order to lead to further cuts in social programs is doomed to failure and will inevitably increase in tax rates.
Other ideologues of the Bush administration argue that the tax cuts are crucial to get out the US recession.
This argument is also wrong.
America's economy could recover without the tax cuts, and perhaps even more firmly.
In all cases, this is a huge mistake that for the long-term fiscal on the economic cycle in the short term.
The other countries have two key lessons to learn from this situation.
The first is that the budget deficits looming in the US will sooner or later the international power of America.
The Americans supported the war in Iraq just because they had not to subsidise it by higher taxes.
When the Americans will be forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be less inclined to support military operations expensive abroad.
Indeed, the US will be deeply split internally as the population will be grappling with the fiscal mess left by Bush.
The second lesson is that countries need to plan their budgets, according to the fiscal costs rising caused by an ageing population.
The long-term budget are rarely taken into account by the taxpayers or parliament.
Governments should be forced to submit budgetary assessments on the long term at the same time their annual budget proposals to reduce the trend towards a political manipulation on the short term of the budget.
The US can play the role of an alarm to the other countries.
The White House should give to other countries the same council that the magicians on television to give viewers: "Do not try to do likewise at home."

The politicisation of the securities markets
Many economic and financial analysts complain that the securities markets in emerging countries are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic.
By contrast, a primitive economic in nature is regulating the securities markets in advanced countries and predict their performance is tantamount to predict growth of trees.
This description of the securities markets in emerging countries is not wrong, unfair, because the same description applies to the securities markets in advanced countries.
Indeed, the best analysts know that predict the performance of the securities market of any country is basically to predict the extent to which the government hopes that investors in securities markets in the current political environment.
Take the securities market in America, far more important in the world.
The government gives companies alone and the returns on investment in the securities market forces us to reflect the core of a capitalist economy strong.
This partly explains why the US attract portfolio investors worldwide.
But the returns that make us markets for securities if attractive reflect a fragile political balance.
In particular, tax rates which affect the securities have varied over time with the change of political pressure.
During the second world war, for example, the political support for big fortunes has dwindled and the government has sharply increased taxes on capital gains, dividends and high incomes in general.
When the second world war has helped to improve significantly the economy weakened by the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Roosevelt and Congress have introduced a tax on the windfall profits to ensure that shareholders do not bring a benefit too.
By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but that the securities market was low, American voters have elected Ronald Reagan, a man considered by many as too far to the right to be president.
He asked, and has achieved, cutting taxes on capital gains, dividends and income.
The political interference in the securities market is not just on taxes on capital gains, dividends and income.
Taxes, indirect taxes, the import duties and taxes on sales, which are all paid directly or indirectly by companies, can have a magnified impact on corporate profits and so on the securities market.
This is no coincidence that wherever develop of the securities markets, governments to ensure that these lower taxes on corporate profits after tax.
Indeed, the policies of the securities markets are not subject to taxes.
Instead, almost every activity of the government is corporate profits and, subsequently, the securities market.
After the crash of the securities markets in 1929, the American government has suspended a large part of the antitrust activity that allowed companies to gain a monopoly, which would increase their value.
This policy has delayed the reduction of high unemployment rate, but was not enough to control the political forces deployed in support of the securities market.
Similarly, one of the most important actions taken by President Reagan was to destroy a lot of power remains the unions of America, which rivalisaient to get their share of industry.
The victory won by Ronald Reagan during the strike of air traffic controllers in 1981 was a major turning point for the trade union movement, and also for the securities market which has launched its spectacular market to the rise in 1982.
The American government has been particularly hard to support the stock market since the culmination of the illusion of share prices in 2000, and particularly to cut interest rates repeatedly.
Of course, this measure was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, and not in terms of support for the securities market.
But it is very revealing the extent of the American market for securities that one of the most important factors weighing on the economy is the price of shares falling.
Indeed, the authorities is not limited to a monetary stimulus.
The national accounts of products and income from the United States show that the actual rate of tax on corporate profits (the percentage of profits actually paid the government in the form of taxes) rose in Crete in 33,7% during the first quarter of 2000 (the record of the securities market and economy in general) and has dropped to 20,2% during the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was low.
A large part of this decline reflects the measures of tax relief package passed by Congress and the perception among businesses, in the economic and political environment, they can be more combatives to avoid paying taxes.
Moreover, after the crash of the securities market, the maximum tax on dividends on securities has fallen from 35% to 15%, providing a new, substantial benefit to investors on the long term and intensifying the combined effect of the reinvestment of dividends after tax.
Again, this tax cut was justified to stimulate the economy which can, of course, apply to virtually every measure to support the securities market.
But it is the balance of political forces that determines the credibility of this kind of justification.
One could argue that the same variables, including hostility to high taxes and a trade union movement, have worked in the United States over the past 200 years and that they should continue to operate in the future, producing high returns on the securities markets and attracting foreign capital inflows.
Those who believe that investment in the US market securities will follow the same trend of higher growth for decades could well be right.
But it must be clear on what we predicted.
The forecasts are primarily not only on the economy but also on policy, even on the cultural values, that are shaping the political and economic performance.

The housing market to global
There is no investment in local property investment. The residence that you are buying is rooted in a specific location, as a tree, and displayed or languishes in the local economic conditions.
The world has on our television screens, but the housing market, composed almost exclusively to local amateur, rarely cross geographical boundaries.
Soon, however, this could change.
In a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in collaboration with my company MacroMarkets and with Fiserv and Standard &amp; Poor's, will launch of the options on futures in house prices in 10 cities in the États-unis.
The contracts will be based on the home price indices &amp; P / Case-Shiller, established in terms of speculative research that my colleague Karl Case and I have carried out, there is almost 20 years.
For some time, démarchons in favour of a housing market, but no stock exchange, until now, wanted to use these indices to create such a market.
The futures markets on house prices will allow investors around the world to invest indirectly in the American real estate, in these markets.
A buyer in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will take the opportunity to invest in homes occupied by their owners in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, among others.
One of the fundamental principles of financial theory -- diversification and risk-spreading -- means that interest in these new contracts will be strong.
Businesses and residents of New York, for example, are surexposés risks to local real estate. However, selling their homes, they should manage to reduce these risks.
Investors in Tokyo will take a risk by buying long-term housing in New York, if the price is right.
The New Yorkers will continue to live in their homes while having shared the investment risk around the world.
The experience of a genuine market to run on homes uni-familiales has not been retentée since 1991, when the London future and options exchange (called now euronext.liffe) has missed the start of such a market.
It has never generated large volumes of transactions.
The stock market has launched a concept that has not convinced.
The UK markets of Paris diversified house prices, like some retail markets, were never far off either.
Will it be different this time?
Of course, the launch of a new market is still uncertain. People are interested in an idea if it attracted a lot of others; if no one is impressive, it will attract more.
The same goes for the markets. If there is no investors interested in, it will not be enough business to generate profits to attract others.
However, like all good ideas, we never know very well why they attract. Also, we cannot predict the launch of this new market, but we know that sometimes the success is in place.
The original indicators suggest that the growing interest in transactions in term of house prices, especially because of the ambient speech on the "housing bubble," stresses the importance of risk diversification.
After the announcement of the CME, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said his project to create options on futures in the largest American, based on real estate prices means published by the National Association of Realtors (National Association of Estate Agents).
However, in addition to the strong public interest in property investment and cover the risks, another thorny issue must be settled for the futures markets work well: prices must be publicly disclosed and investors should understand the meaning.
I believe that “ there are great opportunities for these markets to end soon lead to falling prices in some American cities.
It will issue "déport ’, as traders say. Today, the price to end on the market is lower than the price of property.
Presumably, the déport will not from the first day of property transactions, but it should happen within a few months.
We may need to déport if some of these markets fulfill their duties.
Everyone knows that these cities have experienced a huge real estate boom in recent years (this is a global phenomenon everywhere).
International investors do not seem very keen to invest in those cities, without the prospect of falling prices, based on the futures markets. The inhabitants of Tokyo have learned to their expense.
If the déport is important enough, even the investors who believe that the US housing market is declining can still expect a good return home prices, because they already have a lower price on the futures market.
However, New Yorkers will need to make some adjustments to cover their own property investments, if they want to sell futures and, of course, lower prices.
They will be at the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline, and that they cannot protect itself from the tiny margin potential that exceeds the anticipation.
In fact, such adjustments in our way of thinking will occur, probably looking at the future prices of the market.
Until now, the development of housing prices has mainly been the result.
When the market to create an international consensus on house prices in all the major cities around the world, it is easier to manage the risks they face in stabilising, their economies and our own standards of living.

But what moves the market?
Since the 10 May, most of the global markets have shown strong cumulative declines, particularly in two weeks on 23 May, with average prices persist.
The concerns on the global stock markets are synonymous with concerns for the economy of the world?
Consider the reductions the more pronounced.
Among the major countries, the crash the most impressive is that of India, where prices have fallen 16.9% between the 10 May and May 22.
The debacle of the other side of the world has taken almost as much. There, the ups and downs had only a few days later with those of India: Argentina, prices have fallen by 16.1%, in Brazil of 14.7% and Mexico to 13.8%.
The European markets have also suffered big losses.
In Sweden, prices have plummeted by 15.2% between May 9 and 22 May, almost on the same period, they were down 9.7% in Germany, 9.4% in France and the United Kingdom and 9.3% in Italy.
In Asia, prices fell by 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan at roughly the same period.
Many commentators are trying to combine these events on the situation in the États-unis.
However, Americans have charged that a drop of 5.2% between 9 and 24 May.
China does not appear to be behind this global downturn since the prices have risen there during this period.
The explanations of the economists on the monetary policies.
In the wake of the great fear of deflation in 2003, central banks worldwide have cut interest rates, causing explosions speculative housing markets and the stock market.
But today, according to this point of view, interest rates increase starting to bite, which heralds of further declines in the markets.
There is certainly an important element of truth in this argument.
The Federal Reserve has increased its interest rates on 10 and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, has indicated that further increases could be held in the future.
The 17 May, a worsening of US data has been found, which suggests future durcissements monetary policy.
Economists like to think the world is logical and manageable, which means that they understand what is happening there.
But they often overstate the role of central banks.
Indeed, the increase in American rates was in a series of rate increases -- the 16th in a row.
No other major central bank has increased its rates after the start of the decline in stock markets in May until around 7-8 June, when several were set (the European Central Bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).
Another factor: the price of oil, which has increased by 24% between March 22 and 2 May, beating all his records.
That would undoubtedly be a major event capable of influencing the markets worldwide.
The oil price rises are playing the role of the culprit in almost all the economic recessions since World War II.
And yet the sky high oil prices do not match when asset prices having fallen, in mid-May.
That these increases have led the declines of markets requires a gap of several weeks.
But the stock markets are not very logical, and a mistimed the oil price shock might be possible.
As for all the way in any financial market, an increase always attracts the attention.
When oil prices are rising rapidly, people watch the information that talk about it and discuss them with these increases, thus creating a greater sensitivity to these new.
The Middle East crisis is linked to oil prices, and it has been the dominant information in May.
Signs of doom and the strong language used by various political figures have been amplified in the spirit of investors in oil price rises.
May 8, Israel's Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres, in response to hostile statements of the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, told "The Iranian president should remember that Iran also could be wiped off the map."
Similarly, around the beginning of falling stock market in May, Ahmadinejad has visited Indonesia, the country with the greatest number of Muslims in the world, and newspapers have reported on 13 May, he had received a standing ovation from students of two of the best universities in the country.
This story may have been interpreted as proof that the strategy of brinkmanship to Ahmadinejad in the nuclear field to give him political dividends, fueling the perception that the tense situation in the Middle East could lead to other oil price rises.
These articles in newspapers can seem far more remote from the stock markets that monetary policy.
But the public reaction that they are, and the recent increases in oil prices, could go for good measure in the changing market psychology.
Attitudes will change over time, and events like the remarks of Ahmedinejad and Peres can precipitate the changes.
So, although these events are difficult to quantify, perhaps the analysts also should pay attention to the words of Ahmadinejad as Bernanke when they try to understand the direction of the stock markets worldwide.
Economists are perhaps not focus on the mentality of the public and how it interacts with the price fluctuations, the new world and the dynamic speculative.
This would mean that the economic events are less predictable (and economists less omniscients) that they might like to imagine.
However, intuitif it would be logical to do so.
What is really in the head of investor?
Ahmadinejad is a charismatic figure, Bernanke.
Ahmadinejad is embarking on an adventure, Bernanke.
And, perhaps the most important, Ahmadinejad has an influence destabilizing, Bernanke.
Whatever their cause in the end, the world's stock drops in mid-May indicate a market psychology unstable.
Hard to believe that they were linked to the opinions regarding possible monetary policies, and not on broader issues and deeper, especially in energy and political tension, which are the foundations of the performance of the global economy.

Why pay more for the fair trade?
Marks &amp; Spencer, the chain of supermarkets and clothing, owner of 400 shops across Britain, has just announced that it would convert its full range of cafes and thés including 38 different products at the fair trade logo, the symbol marketing of the "ethical production."
The chain sells already only tea and coffee bearing the label in the 200 shops of coffee 'Café Revive. "
It also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods made from cotton trade fair.
The announcement took place during the "half of fair trade." during these two weeks of promoting products, the presentation -labelled sessions were held with producers in developing countries to explain the British how this form of commerce has helped their communities.
The movement towards a more ethical consumption also has a significant step forward to États-unis. Consumers are becoming more organic foods or produced locally, such as eggs from free-range freedom.
In the UK, a study has shown that more than 50% of respondents recognised symbol of fair trade and understood that products bearing the label complied with more working conditions for producers of the developing world.
Currently there is no comparable to the États-unis study, but the data reported and discussions with my own students suggests that the figure would be less expensive for Americans.
Traders willing to obtain certification fair trade producers must pay a price covering the costs of a sustainable production and a living wage.
For example, the minimum prices for a pound of coffee is $1.26, regardless of the lower levels of the market.
If the market price goes beyond that figure, the tariff on fair trade will increase to remain as high of 5 cents per pound.
For small producers, they are organized into cooperatives, or in other types of groups for a Democratic participation.
The plants and factories can claim the label fair trade if they offer a decent wage their workers, if they comply with health standards, environmental and safety, if they allow the unions or any other form associations of workers, if they provide accommodation worthy to workers who are far from home and if they use or forced labour, or the work in childhood.
However, everyone does not support fair trade.
Brink Lindsey, director of the Centre of Studies on the trade policies of the Cato Institute, pro-marché body, believes that the campaign for the coffee labellisé fair trade is a "stalemate paved with good intentions.
It is in justifying that the real cause the collapse of coffee is not the achievement of excessive profits by multinationals, but in the enormous increase production of coffee in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new technology culture caféière working less and therefore at no cost.
In the prospect of Lindsey, if we want to help the coffee growers, we need to encourage them to abandon the coffee and turn to more profitable crops -- it is here, rightly, on trade restrictions imposed by the rich countries and on the subsidies that are obstacles to be removed -- or the products of high value, such as the special cafes that can be paid more expensive.
What is strange in the arguments of Lindsey, however, is that the campaign to fair-trade coffee seems to do exactly what he calls, encourage the coffee growers to produce special cafes that can be paid more expensive.
Economists pro-marché do not object to companies that use the appeal of the luxury to promote their products.
If people are prepared to spend $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, because it is coffee preferred to James Bond, economists do not, in this case, that the market is distorted.
So why be so critical of consumers who want to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know he has been grown without pesticides, under trees ombrageux favourable to the survival of birds, by producers who can now feed and educate decently their children?
Economists might respond to that if you want to help people to feed and educate their children, it is possible to buy a book of coffee non-équitable to taste the same for $10 and pay the remaining $2 to a charity, which distributes food and scolarise poor children.
This is indeed a possible strategy. However, fair trade is real benefits.
The producers know that they must produce a coffee appreciated by consumers not only for his liking, but also for the way it is grown.
If their coffee sells well, they are proud to have produced a product found in the world.
The point of view of the growers, receive a bonus by selling a product labellisé fair trade is preferable to a charity that they would receive all ways, they work or not, and whatever the quality of their production.
Pay more for a product labellisé fair trade is no more "anti-marché" that spending more to buy a product of Gucci brand.
Moreover, this label reflects better ethical priorities.
It is not only a grant by governments, its success dependent on market demand and not the lobbysme policy.
Fortunately, in Europe, this demand is growing rapidly.
Hope it will quickly such levels throughout the developed countries, where consumers can decide on their own how to spend their money.

The calves, pigs and the American democracy.
Among the flood of securities on the return of the Democratic majority in Congress after the November elections, the result of an important vote has gone largely unnoticed.
Although it has highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, it has also led to believe again in the compassion of American citizens.
In Arizona, citizens can, if they have gathered enough signatures, submit a bill to the popular vote.
This year, one of the questions submitted to the ballot box was a law to ban the pens, or calves reared for meat, are sanglés or confined in a way that prevents them from moving freely, lie or extend their states.
Those who do not know the intensive farming methods will be surprised perhaps the need for such legislation.
The traditional method, as it is practised around the world there are 50 years ago, and in some countries still today, allows the animals move and stretch.
But today, nearly 90 percent of sows reproducing -- mothers of pigs reared and slaughtered for meat, bacon and ham -- spend most of their lives in the stalls, which measured about 60 centimeters by 2, 2 metres.
They may not look or expand their legs once lying, or move forward or back to more than one.
They also sometimes sanglées to limit their movements.
Similarly, calves are stationed throughout their lives in individual boxes where they cannot go, go to bed or stretch.
Essentially, these methods are designed to save the labor costs. They facilitate the management of animals and will employ fewer workers, and less qualified.
They also prevent animal waste of energy in déplaçdant or by fighting between them.
A few years, following protests from animal welfare organisations, the European Commission has asked for a report to the standing committee of the EU in the intensive farming methods.
The report's conclusions, indicate that the animals suffer cannot move and the boredom of not having anything to do for days.
Of course, the simple common sense can achieve the same conclusions.
Follow the report, the EU has set the dates on which the confinement of farm animals will be banned.
For the calves, on 1 January 2007.
The individual sow stalls, already banned in Britain and Sweden, will be banned from 2013 throughout the European Union.
Measures to improve the welfare of battery hens, high in stack them without enough room to expand their wings are also applied progressively.
The United States, nothing that is expected.
Earlier, when my European friends asked me why the United States there is such a delay in the welfare of animals in Europe, I knew that answer.
If they insisted, I had to admit that one possible explanation was that the Americans cared less about the animals that Europeans.
Then, in 2002, the groups of animals parvinrent to submit to the popular vote a proposed ban on individual sow stalls in Florida.
À's surprise, the proposal was accepted by 55 percent of voters.
Last month in Arizona, despite opposition generously funded by the food industry, the ban on boxes of confinement for calves and pigs has also been approved by 62 percent of voters.
Neither the Florida and Arizona are États particularly progressive -- both voted for George W. Bush against John Kerry in 2004.
The results of these two popular vote suggest strongly that if all Americans should decide on the maintenance of the pregnant sows and veal in containment, a large majority would be.
Ultimately, it seems that Americans are concerned as well as Europeans living conditions for animals.
To explain the difference between the welfare of animals in the US and Europe, it is without doubt compare political systems.
In Europe, the concerns of voters on the life of animals have found a resonance among members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, with the adoption of national and EU directives to improve their lot.
The United States, those same concerns have had no visible effect on the members of Congress.
There is no federal law on the farm animal welfare and virtually no legislation in the États.
Àb my opinion, the tens of millions of dollars from the food industry enjoyed by officials seeking to be re-elected is for something.
The movement of animals, despite a strong popular support, is not the weight in the arena of lobbying and political donations.
In the American electoral races, the money in more than the views of the voters.
The party discipline is weak and the delegates should get themselves, most of the funds needed for their re-election -- in this case, every two years for members of the House of Representatives.
In Europe, where the discipline of the parties is respected and where the parties, and not the candidates, according to election campaigns money plays a role less important.
The United States, a country proud of its democratic tradition, calves and pigs are not the only losers.

What new on the new army entirely composed of Afghans?
The assassination of Afghan Minister of aviation by a mob (perhaps encouraged by members of the interim administration in Afghanistan) shows that Afghan society remains deeply showing cracks.
The first reforms on the Afghan army will only exacerbate these divisions.
The minister of defence of the temporary administration of Hamid Karzai in Kabul has already appointed the senior officers of the new army.
The minister, General Mohammed Fahim, is one of Tajikistan Panjshir district in the North, which is now three months earlier the leader of the forces of the Northern Alliance that has captured Kabul after the bombers Americans they have cleared the way.
As a group, its use is a direct challenge to the goal of reunification of the country of Mr. Karzai.
Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic nation, the largest group, the Pashtuns, who represent the two fifths of the total population.
The hazars and Tajiks are, respectively, a fifth of the population.
On the 38 officers elevated to general by Mr. Fahim, 37, the Tajiks are the trente-huitième as an Uzbek.
If, on the 15 to 17 million Pashtuns in the country, some are recruited as soldiers, they will serve under a command structure almost entirely composed of Tajiks.
The language of Pashtuns is different, however, the Tajik as the Spanish and English, and millions of Pashtuns reaching the age of military service were at best only a few notions of Tajik.
The profile of the new military authority is also restricted its ethnic composition.
35 on the 38 senior officers from a small area north of Kabul, including the province of Parwan (where is the airport near Bagram) and the Panjshir Valley, the bastion of the Northern Alliance.
In other words, the heads of potential from 27 of the 29 provinces of Afghanistan have been excluded from the new military leadership of their country.
A group so restricted could overcome the impression that its members are a collection closed if they represent a broad cross-section of the dozen political parties.
But this is not the case.
Eighteen of the 38 senior officers have just one party, the Jamiat-e-Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by Mullah and former professor of theology Burhanuddin Rabbani.
This was the party that gouverna Kabul briefly in the mid-1990s, creating the bloodshed and chaos that has led most of the Afghans to welcome the arrival of the Taliban.
The Communists equalled the number of members of the Jamiat in the military hierarchy.
Sixteen of 38 officers have long aligned to the party whose tricks in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which took two and half million lives in Afghanistan.
Most Afghans now see the Communists with the same degree of sympathy for the Czechs and Poles to get National Socialists of Hitler.
It is true that the Afghans, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for different reasons and that they were in no way all ideologues hardened.
But in the case of the generals of general Fahim, six were professional workers of the Communist Party and have continued to serve the party after the invasion of the Red Army.
These six men, plus three communists who served as officers in the Afghan army, have worked hard during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which lasted a decade.
Imagine how the French would have responded if a quarter of the body of French officers of the après-deuxième world war had joined the Wehrmacht during that it was in their country.
In Afghanistan, the new travel through the mouth to listen.
The Nationalists Afghans (i.e., almost all Afghans) discover soon the political reasons for members of the innermost circle of general Fahim, if not already done.
Even this overwhelming evidence of bias and prejudice in the formation of the high command of the new army could be outvoted if the generals included professionalism and commitment to patriotic values of real national armed forces in their task.
Unfortunately, only 10 of the 38 officers promoted by Fahim received a trained professional military officers.
An eleventh served as a pilot.
By contrast, 24 on the general 38 (the training of the remaining four generals are still unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, which come from the offices of the Communist Party, or in a case, which have been Mullah.
That means all of these statistics in terms of everyday reality?
They mean that when the heads of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as official military and diplomatic Americans face the sous-ministre Afghan defence, they will meet Abdul Rashid Dostum, a Lord of War and a communist notoriously brutal and corrupt, which remains in contact with old friends of the Red Army are still in Moscow.
This means that the head of the armed forces in Afghanistan as well as the head of operations and the head of intelligence service of the Army are also communists, men whose loyalty remain uncertain and that many Afghans were wary.
The team it is likely to unite a war-torn Afghanistan?
The presence in Kabul of a dubious team if it is likely to inject confidence in three-quarters of the Afghan population that are excluded from the military high command?
Or this list it is rather the harvest of an approach "to the winner" of the government that is required (at some point in the future) to unleash another bloody reaction National by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled on?
The UN and European politicians and Americans must ponder these questions before agreeing to a takeover of relentless by a small minority unpopular.

Celebration of the irrational
Two cheers for the new Nobel laureates economics: Daniel Kahneman Princeton University and Vernon Smith of George Mason University of Virginia.
As many Nobel Prize, the rewards are not only the key work undertaken by millimetres. Kahneman and Smith, but also the schools of thoughts that they have helped to develop.
Mr Kahneman, psychologist, has shown that individuals are always less than traditional classical economists do not believe.
His work shows not only that people sometimes act differently from theoretical predictions of economic standard, but also that they do it regularly, and, in a manner which can be understood and interpreted through different assumptions that compete with those used by the mainstream economists.
For most market participants, and observers, it seems not to make much difference.
The traders on Wall Street that traffic with the actions that they know to be bad exploit the irrational that mm. Kahneman and Smith have shown.
A large part of the excitement that led to the swelling of the markets was based on the exploitation of the psychology of investors.
In fact, this irrationality is not new for economists, either.
John Maynard Keynes décrivit once the stock market as not being based on the fight of rational individuals to discover the foundations of markets, but rather as a beauty contest in which the winner is spot on the more those that the judges say.
The Nobel Prize this year celebrates the criticism of the market economy simplistic, just like last year (that I have received with two other members).
The winners of last year was focusing on the fact that the market players have different information (and imperfect), and that this asymmetry of information has a marked impact on the functioning of the economy.
Specifically, the winners of last year sous-entendaient that markets are not effective; it is governments a great role to play.
The invisible hand of Adam Smith, the idea that free trade leads to the effectiveness as guided by an invisible hand is invisible, in part because it does not exist.
This, too, is not new for those who work every day with the markets (and make a fortune by taking advantage of this information asymmetry and the above).
For more than 20 years ago, economists are eager for these so-called ‘ rational ’ forecast models who assumed that all players have the same information (albeit imperfect) and are perfectly rational, that markets are perfectly efficient, that there has never no unemployment (except when it is caused by the unions eager or minimum wages imposed by the governments), and that there has never any rationing of funding.
Such models are contained, particularly in postgraduate courses to États-unis, despite evidence to the contrary that demonstrate the triumph of ideology on science.
Unfortunately, students of these programmes of higher education are now the decision-makers in many countries and they are trying to implement programmes based on these ideas, that is today known as the market fundamentalism.
Let me be clear here: the models of rational expectations have contributed significantly to economic theory; rigour that their supporters have imposed on the economic thinking has highlighted the weakness of many underlying assumptions.
Any good scientific thought is able to recognise the limits, but the prophets of rational expectations generally have shown little modesty.
Vernon Smith is one of the leaders of the development of the experimental economy, the idea that you can test many economic proposals in a laboratory.
One of the reasons that the economy is so complex, which also explains the many disagreements among economists is that economists can't conduct controlled.
The imbalance the real-life experiences, but in most circumstances, so many things can change so quickly that it is often difficult to disentangle the causes of the consequences.
In principle, in a laboratory, you can experiment monitored, and this release inférences more reliable.
Critics of the economy, which are worried that the subjects to experimental contexts of certain ways of thinking outside the experience, and that the experiences and inférences are not as spare and clear that in the physical sciences.
However, the economic experience make a knowledge of a large number of issues, such as design improved auctions.
Above all, irrationality of market participants, the main issue of the work of Mr Kahneman, has been repeatedly in the context of laboratories.
One of the most fun released by the experimental economy is altruism and selfishness.
It seems (at least in situations experiments) that the experimental subjects are not so selfish that economists believe, apart from a group: economists.
Even as the economy is a discipline that attracts people who are inherently selfish or because the economy is shaping the individuals to make them more selfish?
The answer, certainly, is surely a little of both.
There is no doubt that the experimental research and the future work will help resolve this issue of the relative importance of these hypotheses.
The Nobel prize demonstrates how important it is to study the individuals and economies such as they are and not as we want to see them.
This is only in understanding human behavior real that we can hope to develop policies that will also do better work our economies.

Bush and his energy policy of bad faith.
An episode of the most surreal quality happened, this year during the World Economic Forum in Davos. Experts from the oil industry have explained that the melting of polar cap -- far faster than all the forecast - -- is not only a problem, but also a chance in that huge new quantities of oil will now be accessible.
Similarly, these experts have acknowledged that the refusal of États-unis to sign the law of the sea, the international convention, which determines access to sources of oil offshore and other mineral resources at sea, poses a risk of international conflict.
However, they also stressed the benefits: the oil industry, in its relentless pursuit of new reserves, has no need to beg Congress to get the right to plunder the Alaska.
President George W. Bush has a strange ability not to understand the important messages.
For years, it is increasingly clear that its energy policy is wrong.
Some members of his party refer to a former energy bill drafted by the oil industry, as being very beneficial for all the lobbyists.
In which praised the virtues of the market economy, the only goal of Bush is to give subsidies to the oil industry, despite increasing deficits facing the country faces.
But the market is not working properly when it is a matter of energy. The government should take a totally opposed to what the Bush administration has proposed.
The fact that Americans do not pay the price of pollution -- and above all of their huge production of greenhouse gases -- resulting from their energy waste leads to a devaluation of the energy prices and suddenly, excessive drinking.
The government should encourage energy savings. His speech on setting prices, primarily through the energy tax, is an effective method to do so.
But, instead of saving energy, Bush insisted in a policy of "to start draining America" of its own resources, making it in the future even more dependent on external oil resources.
Regardless of whether a strong demand is rising oil prices and creating a windfall for many Middle East countries, which are not the best friends in America.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush has finally taken the measure of the growing energy dependency of America. It was difficult for him not to see the consequences of rising rapidly rising oil prices.
But, again, the gestures hesitant to his government will worsen the problems in the immediate future.
Bush is still refuses to act in favour of energy savings and spend very little money to support his continued prayer of salvation.
What to do, then, the recent declaration of Bush on his commitment to reduce, in the 25 years ago, oil dependency of America in the middle east of 75%?
For investors, the message is clear: invest more in the new reserves in the Middle East, which are by far the least expensive oil resources in the world.
However, if there is no new investment in the reserves in the Middle East, the unbridled growth in energy consumption to États-unis, China and elsewhere means that demand outstrips supply.
And on top of all of Bush's threats of sanctions against Iran could lead to disrupting the supply of one of the largest producers of the world.
With a global oil production almost at its peak and prices have almost doubled since the war in Iraq, this heralds prices even higher and more profits for the oil industry, the only real winner of the policy of Bush's Middle East.
However, nobody should blame Bush for having acknowledged that there is a problem.
But, as always, his proposals are nothing more than a small trick of his administration.
In addition to his refusal to admit global warming, to encourage energy savings or allocate sufficient funds for further research, the great promise for Bush to reduce America's dependence on Middle East oil does not mean much.
With only 20% of America's oil pumped in the Middle East, the aim of Bush could simply be achieved by increasing modestly supplies from other parts of the world.
The Bush administration must realise that oil is the global market.
Even if America was completely independent of the Middle East oil, the reduction of energy production in the region would have devastating effects on world prices and certainly on the American economy.
As it is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no clear explanation of the official policy.
Bush is playing with the policy with the feeling anti-arabe and anti-iranien Americans?
Or is yet another example of incompetence and confusion?
According to what we saw these past five years, the right answer is certainly more than a bit of bad faith and pure foolishness.

The road map of China
China is poised to adopt his 11th five-year plan, setting the stage to extend what is arguably the most remarkable economic transformation of history, while improving the well-being of almost a quarter of the world population.
Never before the world had grown as sustainable; never before were there been such a reduction in poverty.
The explanation of the long-term success of China takes part in its unique Association of pragmatism and vision.
While much of the rest of the developing world, according to the Washington consensus, is engaged in a quest to increase GDP worthy of Don Quixote, China has once again made clear that it sought increases of more sustainable and equitable real living standards.
China is aware that it has entered a phase of economic growth imposing huge demands on the environment that will last.
À less to change course, levels of life will eventually be compromise.
This is why the new five-year plan is really focused on the environment.
Many parts of China, among the most backward grew so fast that we crierait to the wonderful if other parts of the country knew faster growth.
While this phenomenon has reduced poverty, inequality has risen, with growing disparities between urban and rural areas and between regions of the coast and the interior.
The report this year of the World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, and not only poverty, should raise concerns, but the 11th five-year plan of China frontalement tackles the problem.
The government raises for several years a more harmonious society, and the plan outlined ambitious plans for this purpose.
China also recognises that what separates the least developed countries of the most developed countries is not only a difference of resources but also of knowledge.
So it has established the bold plans to reduce these disparities and create a basis for an independent innovation.
China's role in the world and in the world economy has changed, and the plan also reflects the situation.
Its future growth will be based more on domestic demand for exports, which means an increase in consumption.
Indeed, China suffers from a rare: a savings.
The people save in part due to weakness in social insurance programs the government: strengthen Social Security (pension), public health and education will reduce the social inequality, will increase the sense of well-being of citizens and household goods.
If it did (and, until now, China has almost always outstripped even its own high expectations) these adjustments may impose huge pressure on a global economic system already destabilized by the huge fiscal imbalances and commercial États-unis.
If China starts at least save -- and if, as has announced its representatives, it has a more diversified investment of its reserves, which is going to finance the trade deficit of more than $2 billion a day of États-unis?
This is an issue to address another day, but this day is perhaps not so distant.
With such a clear understanding of the future, the challenge will be the implementation.
China is a great country, which could not succeed as well without an extensive devolution.
But the decentralization poses its own problems.
The greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.
While America claims that it does not have the resources to do anything about this, the top Chinese officials acted more responsibly.
Within a month after the adoption of the plan, new ecological taxes on cars, petrol and timber products have been imposed: China is using market mechanisms to resolve its environmental problems and those of the world.
But the pressure on leaders of local governments to create economic growth and jobs will be enormous.
They will be very tempted to say that if America is not capable of producing way to protect our planet, how they could?
To translate this vision into action, the Chinese government will need strong policies, particularly significant increases in taxes on the environment.
While China has been transformed into a market economy, it was to develop some problems that are the scourge of developed countries: special interests obscuring the personal interests under a mask of ideology.
Some will mention the nor inclusive effect: Do you not for the poor, everyone will benefit from growth.
And other obstructing the policies of competition and the strict laws of corporate governance: Let Darwinism operate its wonders.
The arguments of growth will be developed to prevent major social and environmental policy: for example, increase taxes on petrol will kill our car industry is beginning to emerge.
Such policies so-called pro-croissance does not only fail to provide growth, they would threaten the entire vision of China's future.
There is a way to avoid it: the open discussion of economic policies in order to unveil sophistry and provide the means to implement creative solutions for the many challenges China faces today.
George W. Bush has shown as it is dangerous to abuse the secrecy and restrict the decision-making process to a close circle of sycophantes.
Most people outside China do not realise how its leaders, conversely, engaged in the deliberations extended and extensive consultations (even with foreigners) when they struggled to solve the problem they face.
The market economies are not auto-régulatrices.
They cannot simply be left on automatic pilot, especially if you want to ensure that their profits are widely shared.
But dealing with a market economy is not easy.
It is a balancing act, which must always respond to economic changes.
The 11th five-year plan of China provides a road map in this direction.
The world, full of hope and fear, while the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be processed.

The lessons on democracy de Tocqueville
The fact of the war in Iraq, 200 years after the birth of Tocqueville, the world has discussed the nature of democracy.
Tocqueville is rightly famous for having rejected the nostalgia reactionary, given that democracy is our destiny, warning, however, on the dangers it presents for freedom.
Should we share his concern?
Tocqueville did not consider democracy first as a political system, but primarily as an intellectual property that shapes the customs and traditions of society, awarding him a sociological and psychological dimension.
Tocqueville believed that the democratic regimes guide the course of our thoughts, our desires and our passions.
And there has been the renaissance man and the twentieth century Homo Sovieticus, "the rights of democracy" is a form of human beings.
For Tocqueville, the systemic effects of democracy can lead people to abandon their ability of reasoning.
They can only pretend to judge the events and the values by themselves, when in fact they simply repeat the views réductrices of the majority.
What Tocqueville called the stranglehold of the "social power" on the opinion is probably stronger in democratic systems - a view that made the level of demagoguery and manipulation by the media in the modern world.
Tocqueville believed that over the long term, nothing can really object to this trend.
Neither local democracy, or small groups inside the company or the checks, and civil rights cannot prevent the decline of critical thinking that democracy is.
The school is at best an enclave immune to the influence irresistible that society has in mind.
In the same way Tocqueville believed that the search of virtue in the manner of old or a religious faith can sometimes raise the soul, but both are incompatible with the democratic ideal when they are imposed by the authorities in public life.
The theorists néo-marxistes school in Frankfurt and Hannah Arendt who feared above all the disappearance of reason in modern societies are the heirs to the thought of Tocqueville.
It can also noted that the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet has called one of these recent books democracy against itself.
For these authors, the democratic way of life tends to eliminate any original thinking and prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, yielding to a mediocrity that leave people vulnerable to the enemies of democracy.
If history is replete with criminal regimes supported by the masses intimidated and manipulated, the greater risk of democratic countries is to see their citizens in the indifference and focus on short-term thinking, in search of their immediate interest.
The past - despite the rituals that are aimed at the commemoration of historical events - is masked by the dependence on the moment and the hype.
Even the ruling class, supposedly educated, is a victim of this grip.
The main problem with the mentality of democracy lies in its lack of historical awareness.
And the proclaimed Tocqueville, the shortcomings of democracy are pessimism resigned the only realistic path – but unacceptable - which is open to us?
I think not.
There are ways to combat what might be called the "stupidity Democratic" that spread today.
The first of these resources to develop an education system which form of real criticism, particularly through education matters largely neglected (today) that are the literature, history and philosophy.
If you want to educate citizens informed and able to think for themselves, which is essential to the functioning of democracy, our schools need to stop running after the latest forms and begin to develop the skills of analysis of pupils.
Because of their tendency to cultivate the superficial and the distraction, the mass media are the main obstacle to such an education.
Today, many people spend more time during their lives to television in a classroom.
The passivity that pushes the mass media is the exact opposite active engagement of citizens, necessary for democracy.
But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (apart from the newspapers of quality) to accept their own volition to become the tools of an education that strengthen the critical of citizens.
This focus on the mass media is not an elitist disregard for popular culture.
It is not just a matter of popularity, Mozart was popular in his time and parts of Shakespeare attiraient poor as the rich - but the refusal of mass culture of questioning and cause.
The result is a passive indifference and widespread public.
For a long time, a global media culture is growing increasingly unable to generate any critical or raise the feelings.
The fact of his lack of interest in these matters is a culture that threatens democratic freedoms, because it is in no way a sense of duty to society, history or the community.
Is it too late to defend itself against a culture that émousse at this point minds?
Tocqueville scorned the elites of his time because of their complacency about the dangers of democracy in droves.
The short-sightedness of our leaders it will help achieve its alarming prediction?

A Europe for all
Members of the European Union seem to doubt the future of the European Union, but the Ukrainians are watching the European Union with some hope and a certain admiration.
The fundamental objective of our foreign policy is to integrate the European progress, because Ukraine has found that national autonomy is not an end in itself, but just a beginning.
Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when a nation is a victim of ostracism, no nation is free.
We are, in Europe, all linked by a link which we cannot escape, linked by a single destiny.
All aspects of culture that we share, without mentioning the century of suffering that we have to share, we confirm this.
Anything that affects a European directly affects us all indirectly.
We can never afford to live with the notions of two Europes, one of haves and have-nots, one of elected and banned.
Anyone living on the European continent today cannot, in fact must not be regarded as a foreigner to his union.
The great Pax Europa today, as current, pan-European prosperity depends on it.
Some would say, of course that Ukraine is not part of Europe.
They come in Kiev and its inhabitants, young and old workers, the wives of farmers, lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood up and remained standing in the cold and snow for weeks now to defend their liberties last winter.
Are they not linked to those who are pooled around the General de Gaulle in the French resistance?
Do not body with those who died in battle for the defence of the Spanish Republic in the 1930s, those who libérèrent Budapest in 1956 and put an end to fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970s?
Are they not with the spirit of the Polish solidarnösc and masses of peaceful amorcèrent the velvet revolution in Prague in 1989?
This is the soul of Europe and no doubt will not destroy it.
For all those who consider that Ukraine is too far behind to become a member of the Union, I say: They are also visit my country and see the mothers who stay until late in the office to teach their children using the computer in their office.
They come to watch the language of every village and town where our youth is preparing for Europe in learning French, German and English.
Those who doubt the European vocation of Ukraine should understand that Europe is not a simple question of equipment and motorway: this is the craving for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is also promising that Europe's past is proud, and that our plan is not a land border forgotten in a troubled region but an influential part of peace and unity of Europe.
Self-determination is not synonymous with insulation because the national independence of our days simply means the return on the world stage with a new status.
The new nations can build with their former occupants of the same kind of successful relationship that France has established with Germany: a relationship based on equality and mutual interests.
This is the type of relationship that my government wants to establish with Russia, so we can help extend the area of peace in Europe.
It is premature, of course, to go beyond the indication of the utmost importance we attach to the possibility of entering the European Union.
We know that our role in this great structure will not come about in a night.
We know that the great works of European unity is not confined to the documents and statements but are rooted in the innovative designed to improve living standards and provide security to all Europeans.
Build a Ukraine to join the European Union will not be easy or quick or without effort.
But as the European Union itself, it will be built and it will happen.
We know that the challenge is great but this is worthwhile and Europe must understand that this is our goal.
The renovation of Ukraine depends in part by a battle, innovative, ending a century nightmare in which fascism and communism, ideologies born at the heart of Europe, clashed for taking power.
Through the cities of Ukraine a few months, parents and children are armed troops, dogs grondants and even death.
There is only a few years yet, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public on the corruption of our former regime, was assaulted and beheaded by the henchmen of the regime.
The Orange Revolution, last winter, has proved that Ukraine and its people could win.
And, despite the doubts and difficulties, I still has an unfailing confidence in Europe.
I refuse to accept the despair as final response to the ambiguities and horrors of the history of Ukraine.
I refuse to accept the idea that Ukraine is so tragically condemned to live at the heart of the night without stars of the Communist legacy to the point of never being able to see the day of peace and a real European unity.
When the European Union citizens looking to Ukraine's place in Europe, it will have to look closely and is looking beyond the face that we will show.
See above the devastated areas that has caused communism, beyond the poverty and social divisions through which our former leaders today répudiés sought to extend their grip.
They must consider closely the face of our president, Viktor Yushchenko, swept by the poison that he was administered in the election campaign last year, and remember the words of the great French André Malraux, for which was "the finest faces are wounded."

The Civil War Muslim
The gap between Sunnis and Shiites in the Middle East is far deeper than the current conflict between Israel and the Arabs?
One might think seeing the reaction of some Arab governments to the decisions of Hezbollah to attack Israel.
While the Israeli bombs fall in Beirut and TYR, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the most conservative Muslim Arab state, has openly condemned the actions of the Shiite Hezbollah, who started the war against Israel.
Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a État which sees itself as the leader of the people of Arab Muslims had supported Israel so openly.
In addition, breaking the Saudi Arabia with Hezbollah is not unique.
The Égypte and Jordan have roundly condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism.
What is behind this astonishing situation?
Are we experiencing a key turning point in relations between the Arab nationalism and bigotry Islamic?
The government Sunni Saudi Arabia has he more fear and anxiety in Shiite Islam that is involved in the Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?
The complaints of Hezbollah by Arabs, suggest that the sectarian divide Muslim, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq, is growing and intensifying across the Middle East.
The will of President George W. Bush destroy societies frozen in the Arab world was sentenced to draw up the forces of modernisation against the elements of traditional Islamic societies and Arabs.
It seems to have released the most atavistic forces in the region.
The opening of this Pandora's box has been able to give birth at a time even more terrible violence, which cannot be described as that of "civil war Muslim."
The gap chiite-sunnite since the dawn of the history of Islam, but geographical isolation and ethnic non-arabe Shiite Iran, as well as the dominance of their Shia minorities by Sunni Arab countries, has generally left this rivalry in the background.
Those tensions have fallen more in the wave "Islamisation" created by the Iranian revolution, because in its wake identity sectarian Sunni Arabs have been further put back in the background to measure that was an assertion 'Islamic' board.
This has all changed when al Qaeda terrorist group, a Sunni who is largely based on ideology and staff wahabbites Saudis, has launched its attacks against America in September 2001.
A special branch of Sunni militant Islam was underway.
When the États-unis launched wars against both the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and Iraq's Sunni regime, this new trend radical Sunni has acquired more daring.
Sunni Arabs in the region, which have now won in insurance, see Israel and the West as a threat, including the so-called "Shia crescent" -- the arc of Earth which stretches from Lebanon to Iran to Syria and Iraq, populated by the supposed Shi'ites heretics.
The leaders of Saudi Arabia, as guardians of the holy sites in the Muslim faith of Mecca and Medina, perhaps this threat with more acute.
To Sunnis, Shiites are not confined to dominate the oil-rich regions of Iran, Iraq and the regions of the East of Saudi Arabia, they are also trying, by the actions of Hezbollah, usurping the role of 'protector "the dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.
It is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy to a strict form of Sunni Islam and casts doubt on the loyalty of his Shiite population that the kingdom departs from Hezbollah.
The irony of the thing is that America, protective of Saudi Arabia, made the responsibility of Shia in toppling Saddam Hussein and with the Shiite parties in power in Iraq.
The Bush administration seems to recognize what it did; as the arc of Shia amounts in the east of the Muslim world Arabic, the États-unis trying to consolidate their protection of the arc -- the Sunni Égypte, Jordan and Saudi Arabia -- in the West region.
Israel, once an implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems to be fitted inside the structure defensive.
But such a defensive position is necessarily unstable, simply by panarabes sentiments.
Today, the Saudis, ordinary citizens do not take off Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite TV networks to follow the events in Gaza and southern Lebanon.
They see bloodshed Shiite Arab (not), and only the Hezbollah deal.
For them, Hezbollah has become a model heroic resistance.
This leads the État Saudi Arabia to widen the rift Sunni / Shia.
After the official denunciation of Hezbollah in the kingdom, the Saudi État has asked its official Wahhabi clerics issuing fatwas condemning Hezbollah as a heretic and Shiite deviant.
Such sentences can only exacerbating sectarian divisions within Saudi Arabia and in the region.
In the worsening of the antagonism, the global Sunni Muslim regimes in the belief that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner?
If they reach this conclusion, they will not need to look far away, because the fighters of this kind have already completed a training - backed by Al Qaeda.

Why Europe can no longer ignore Georgia
The time when Europe could rely on America to make war, restore peace and democracy in its own court is over.
With the European Union enlargement and, as demonstrated by the recent crisis of Russian gas, the court now includes not only in Ukraine and Georgia.
Indeed, Georgia, as in Ukraine, democracy is tested and Europe cannot afford to ignore.
Georgia was the first country in the post-Soviet space to operate its "Revolution of colour" and to do this, with dignity and maturity, the choice of its people in favour of democracy and European values.
The flags of the European Union just hover out there on all public buildings Georgians since then to show the commitment, as old as the history of this country which, in the ancient Greeks, was an integral part of the world of the time.
Prometheus, médée, the amazones and in neighbouring Armenia, Noah's Ark, are all signs that our myths starts here.
In its history, culture, traditions, old but also more recently, when Georgia differed from other republics of the former USSR, by his criticism, independent and even somewhat maverick, Georgia is probably even today the location of this area, where the transplant democracy can take the better.
So it is even more worrying to see the democratization of the country under threat.
Everything seemed to have started well enough.
With the launch without striking a blow to a policy of reform, privatisation, the fight against corruption, the research of new and therefore free of appeasing the previous regime, the implementation of a foreign policy marked a return to Europe in the game in Georgia.
The totalitarian mindset has resurfaced in these leaders, which is proclaiming the representatives of the majority, have had more powers.
This is a caste which the Hydra to thousand is dying and rise from the Ashes.
They and their methods of power that the "rose revolution" in November 2003 wanted all at once expunged were reintroduced into the heart of power, using their networks, with contacts including outside the boundaries, the enormous financial burden, their ability to intrigue and manipulation of the political and electoral appliances.
This is a power that does not sufficiently the essence of democracy is not in the polls but in the division and the balance of power.
Every day, the government to interfere in the Legislature, the vast majority of laws are written to the chancellery presidential and parliament wants to control the daily exercise of government policy, including, in my case, the appointment of ambassadors and their day-to-day operation.
Finally, and this is the most serious, the judiciary have still not managed to break away from the guardianship of the executive and is more or not yet for the citizen or the investor the guarantor and protector, without which it is not to État of law and economic freedom.
This is a society to be democratic in his head, is not yet in his legs. It is still reluctant to engage in politics, leaving the scene to those who care for too long.
Because this democracy is in danger of collapsing, but because it is still there, located strongly in the population in the civil society organisations, in a press who is seeking but that does not lose his faculty criticism...
It is time for Europe to save democracy in order not to destroy all those hopes.
The États-unis have already done what they have, since independence, and they are beside the stability of Georgia.
The stability was certainly not identified democracy under Édouard Shevardnadze, Former Soviet foreign minister that the Rose Revolution has resigned his post of Georgian President.
But the Americans have invested very generously to the survival of Georgian elites and their learning of democracy.
The critical initiatives Soros, today at the way, seems the most misplaced: the revolution in November was not created from scratch by the Americans, not withstanding the propaganda of the Russian nationalists too accustomed to the intervention to think differently, but the substrate democracy which has enabled has certainly been fed, encouraged and supported by the aid of the Soros Foundation.
The course that must be taken today for Georgia withdraws his body -- this time définitivement- evil totalitarian, is a complex that would support another nature that Europeans are more likely to provide.
The models that must be proposed for the balance of power, the institutions of État of law, the operation of the judiciary or local democracy must be guided forms of Europe closer to reality in Georgia that the Anglo-Saxon model variant.
If Europe today rejected this task, it will be betraying his fundamental duty in this country, small, Mediterranean, flexible, long tradition, where democracy has much better chances of success than in Ukraine, which is both great and always very Soviet in his mind, without referring to Central Asia.
Not to help Georgia is to accept that democracy and stability are so long to come not only in Tbilisi, but even more in Kiev, Minsk, to say nothing of Moscow.
It is above all take a very serious risk.
Moscow, with ups and downs, endless dithering, an internal systems, began to resign themselves to the idea of the inevitability of democracy, at least around it, not without having to abandon its imperial dreams and their instruments of power could suddenly revise its perception.
This resignation is faltering, this acceptance of normality in its relations with its neighbours, who was in its infancy, can be washed away by a sudden eruption of the irrationality of Russian power of the infamous "derjava" which is unable to resist the lure of weakness, the feeling of empty, the temptation to again be not equal, but the strongest.
This explains the recent crisis of Russian gas.
Any sign of a decline of democracy, slowing of the Democratic tide, will be taken by Moscow as a hope no sense of reversibility where gradually Russia accoutumait to no longer believe.
It is Europe's responsibility to convince Russia that it is up to his hope in a return to past.
Europe has the responsibility for itself, its future energy independence. It also has the responsibility to demonstrate that there are also strong European values -- freedom, democracy, justice between peoples.
For that Europe must provide the tools of his policy: a large public private foundation for Europe and democracy, a university to train the executives tomorrow of democracies that seek again, a police, an army of judges and magistrates who live models close to the companies we want to convert.
Europe needs most of conviction.
If Europe does not itself agreed that it is the fate of its neighbours, democracy and the future of its values and spread, who believe in it tomorrow?

Berlusconi beleaguered
Silvio Berlusconi, who will become president of the European Union on 1 July, is a wise man who once loved to take risks and the Paris commercial prove profitable. In the 1960s, it was the first to see that Milan, then a traditional Italian city where people work for work, would become a modern metropolis, surrounded by the suburbs of American style.
Then he built his fortune in the boom in property.
Fifteen years later, Mr. Berlusconi realized that the monopoly held by the Italian state television would not survive and he used to create what will become the first private media group in Italy.
But it would not have achieved in both the TV in the area real estate, if it had not prepared for political relations.
In both cases, Berlusconi has prevailed over its competitors by taking advantage for the Socialists, then the rising stars of Italian politics.
His association with Bettino Craxi, the most influential politician in Milan in the 1970s and prime minister of Italy in a large part of the 1980s, has seen the day very soon.
However, political relations are not enough to become a politician.
Indeed, trade policy was certainly not part of the wishes of Berlusconi.
His media group, weakened by excessive diversification (the decision to enter the distribution of detail was virtually destroyed), encountered problems in the 1990s.
Almost simultaneously, former Premier Craxi runs away in Tunisia, pursued by the Italian courts in the context of an investigation of corruption mani pulite conducted in the vast network known as Tangentopoli (Bribesville).
The brain and exile of Craxi created a sense of loss among Berlusconi by denying them the support strong policy that he needed.
He decided to become its own sponsor.
As has often been the case in Italy's history, the decision of Berlusconi to form a new political party (Forza Italia) a few months before the elections of 1994 was off.
The lack of experience of Silvio Berlusconi in policy resulted in the fall of his first government six months after.
All rights as rich as Berlusconi would probably have abandoned.
But it persista and presided over the opposition for six years ago.
In 2001, his determination was rewarded with a resounding victory and, most important, a seemingly destined to change.
Once again, Berlusconi has probably had no choice: in the late 1990s, his association with the Socialists in disgrace the continued both politically and legally.
His only hope to stave off the bench was in control of parliament and to introduce new laws to stop the number of trials for corruption that the guettait, a strategy that allows him to escape prosecution until his term ends.
Unfortunately, while Berlusconi's government is invariably never short of speech, the legal provision put in place to suspend its trials are among the few laws that were taken during his two years in power.
The achievements of Berlusconi government combine good idea (for example, the attempt to reform pensions Italian in 1994) and implementation inadequate (mainly by lack of courage, as surprising as it appears to be).
In 1994, during his first term, he realized early on that Italy should overhaul its pension system and he introduced legislation courageous.
But one general strike proved enough to kill his reformist zeal.
Recently, he has bravely sided with the United States in the war in Iraq, against the majority of the country and its own political coalition.
But it soon after it became alarmed by his own courage and it became an ally almost invisible.
Despite its rhetoric, Berlusconi does not assista (or was not invited) at the summit with President Bush in the Azores, which was taken the final decision to go to war.
As far as social reforms, he fought the unions, but without engaging the good war: the notorious "18" of Italy, which allows the courts of the work to restore an employee in his work if a judge believes he has been sacked unfairly.
But while article 18 is important in principle, it is almost irrelevant in practice.
It has only served to provoke a confrontation with the unions and to distract the government of social reforms far more important.
Contrary to what happened in 1994, the current government of Berlusconi remains, but those who expected a revolution for the free market will be disappointed.
No significant tax cut was gone and reform on pensions is still waiting.
The powerful finance minister in Berlusconi, Giulio Tremonti, often talk and naive about the need to renew the government intervention in the economy; no action is taken to prevent the strikes in the public transport sector.
The right-wing moderate voters, who wanted an Italian version (i.e., somewhat diluted) in the Reagan era / Thatcher, are disillusioned.
Berlusconi is trying to mask his inactivity frightening its voters, by repeating again and again that the election of the moderate left would be tantamount to sign a pact with the devil (i.e., the communists).
The Italians seem more intelligent, as has clearly demonstrated the result of administrative elections in June.
Why the courageous vision of the 1960s and 1970s it has lost its lustre?
This is partly due to the fact that we are not in this context: Berlusconi has 40 years and during the past ten years he has lived in the world of politics.
It has learned the art of political survival (and personal), but there has lost its vision and his taste for risk.

Fill the technological gap américano European
In the second half of the 1990s, the average annual growth rate of productivity in Europe rose 0.7% while the United States had 1.4%.
However, if we establish a distinction between the industries that produce the information and communication technologies (ICT) and those who simply use these technologies, then that the gap of productivity growth is almost entirely to the weakness of the European production of ICT.
Annual productivity growth in sectors that use the technology ICT has completed an average 0.63% in the US between 1995 and 2000 against 0.41% in Europe.
This situation confirms a well-known fact: Europe is less effective than the US to conduct research leading to innovations because Europe is less resources to research, either because the available resources are used in a less effective, or both.
It is certain that the total spending on research and development are lower in Europe than in the US, but not much.
In the 1990s, the US all the years spent 2.8% of GDP on research and development, compared with 2.3% in Germany, 2% in the UK and 1.9% in France.
European governments continue as usual to complain about the lack of fiscal resources to support research and development (a far-fetched, given the tiny expenditure on research in the European budgets big), and each time the European Commission allows, they are subsidising the innovative companies or those who, according to them, are most likely to invest in research and development.
France and Italy, for example, have demanded that the limits imposed on budget deficits of the eurozone members by the stability and growth exclude public spending for research.
The French government has decided to get out Alstom, a company which developed several high-tech products, including the TGV train, the French, before it is bankrupt.
But it is highly unlikely that these tactics will develop the high-tech sector.
Why?
Because the weakness in research is not, at least not primarily a matter of funding.
The subsidies will not high-tech companies.
First the question of research.
Europe is lagging behind the US in every area: the number of patents, the number of Nobel Prize, the number of researchers from other countries that it can draw.
But the funding is only the tip of the problem.
A euro spent on research in Europe is less productive than a dollar spent in the US for that purpose, and for two reasons: the motivations and demand for technology.
We are afraid that additional spending not followed by a change of rules archaic scholars will only serve to produce more waste and not more discoveries.
They would increase the power, prestige and the resources of pressure groups steadfast composed of university professors established that often prevent access and competition in their university.
The request of technology also plays an important role.
It allows us to focus research required deadlines, look at the results of research and allows us to assess the patents, according to market prices.
Without the reasons given by the beneficiaries of these research findings, research is likely to drift, often without clear direction.
We must recognise that this situation does not apply to all areas: the study fragments of ancient Greek is precious, even if it rarely meets a demand.
But it is important in areas, both theoretical and practical, which could provide the basis for the production of new technologies: physics, biology, chemistry, technical, etc.
But defense spending, which are the main driver of demand for research.
Most of the technological advances in the post-war period (the micro-puces to the Internet until the new batteries for mobile phones developed for the US Army in Iraq) have had at least at the beginning, a military application.
The phones, satellite tracking and cameras high resolution are expensive, but fortunately for industries that use them, their development costs have been partly borne by the government.
A key reason for the superiority of the US in terms of research is explained by the size and composition of defence spending.
The Pentagon budget is not only important: it represents more than half of all American Government spending on research and development; in France, defense spending are only a quarter of the total expenditure.
In 1999, the American spending on research and development related to the defence rose 0.45% of GDP, providing the UK and France have reached only half of this figure, with 0.26% and 0.22%, respectively.
As suggested by the case Alstom, the French have a different model in mind.
Rather than to support research and development with the defense budgets, they prefer to do so directly by subsidizing high-tech companies in France.
The official justification indicates that the budgets of national defence are too low to create demand needed to support research and development in high-tech sectors, while there is still no budget for the European defence.
This is not a coincidence: if it is awarded in a spirit of competition, such a budget supranational would nominate the winners and losers.
But many European countries still refuse to accept that some of their high-tech companies could not be up: they think it is preferable to preserve these companies with generous subsidies and to avoid the consolidation of the European defence budgets.
By integrating its defence spending and raising their importance, Europe kills two birds with one stone.
It would be more credible when it needs to be heard at the tables of international negotiations, particularly about America, and it would boost scientific research.
To achieve this, it should not have larger deficits, which involve simply higher taxes, but to reduce spending in other areas of the budget.
In other words: a sacrifice on the short term for a gain on the long term.

To the U.S.
After nearly 15 years of unprecedented growth, with only a short downturn in 2000 / 2001 - the US is heavily indebted abroad, to 25% of GDP.
With a current-account deficit which is now 5% of GDP, the external debt of the United States is growing quickly.
Yet, no country can take out indefinitely debts, and this situation should therefore take end sooner or later.
At the beginning of the year 1985 when the current-account deficit the US had reached $120 billion - equivalent to a third of the current deficit - the rest of the world stopped the fund.
The dollar was brutally devalued, 50% compared to the deutschmark.
Europe has no interest to renew this experience.
In reality, the world does not have the resources of a sudden disappearance, the current-account deficit.
Without exports to the United States, growth timid that Europe has had over the past year is évanouirait.
The process may have already begun: the value of the euro - to $1.20 to 1.30 dollars in recent months - was enough to paralyse the European growth for the end of this year.
Before the falling dollar, exports of the 25 EU member states have increased by 6.5% per year, 2% for consumption and 3% for investment.
In Japan, the recent recovery was almost totally blown by exports.
But the yen has value and growth there also seems to be suspended.
While central banks worldwide are full of dollars and trade imbalances are worrying, there are three possible solutions.
First, an increase in government savings in the United States.
It is unlikely, at least in the near future, given the ambitious plans by President Bush on tax matters and the continuation of war in Iraq.
The American savings is also slightly negative, and an increase could lead to a slowdown in activity in the short term.
Secondly, a stronger dollar devaluation, well above its present value compared to the euro and yen.
A revaluation of the Chinese yuan would also be a good thing.
Thirdly, a resumption of growth in Europe, which would cause a rise in exports of us.
It would mean that European companies reduce their costs and increase their productivity.
As always, it promises a whole range of "structural reforms," but none will probably be implemented soon.
So what do?
One possibility would be to increase the time to work without proportional increase of the hourly rate.
In the early 1970s, we worked the same number of hours on both sides of the Atlantic.
Today, in France and Germany, is working on average 50% less than in the US.
This is partly due to a European taxation, and on this plan anything is possible: it cannot be forced to work a person who believes that its earnings after tax is not the death.
But the relative decline of working time is also due to the success of unions, which have received the holidays.
A reform in this area, for a longer working hours, would not reduce the total income of employees, but would reduce the costs of production.
This idea is beginning to be addressed in the press and, hopefully, behind the scenes among politicians and leaders of unions.
Meanwhile, the world has an interest in the United States retain a current-account deficit without precedent, the price of $500 billion per year.
This allows the Chinese to maintain the stability of their currency against the dollar, to remain extremely competitive, and gradually 200 million workers in agriculture industry, the aim of authorities for the next decade.
In Europe, America's external deficit is the only source of growth.
But this cannot continue.
A day when the other, Europe will have to stop thinking that the US can save the economy and will rely on its own resources.
But there is no surprise if the United States and the devaluation of the dollar are accused of the next downturn in the European economy.
A scapegoat is always helpful.

Abba Eban, Voice of Israel.
For nearly two generations, Abba Eban has represented the voice of Israel by acting as a messenger from the Conservatives and the powerful nations and the Jewish people worldwide.
Since his first appearance alongside Dr Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940s during the struggle for independence and sovereignty Jewish, only a very few people has been so clearly the Zionist Jewish and with such eloquence and conviction.
With its churchilienne prose and its main shakespeariennes locutions, its mélodieuses and his voice grandiloquent sent for decades the message of hope of a people who could lose hope and faith in humanity after the horrors of the second world war.
As an ambassador to the United States and the UN, then as foreign minister, it was a liberal Israel to which the imagination of the world could identify.
The nations largest and most powerful enviaient a spokesman so strong and his speeches became the classic cases for men of state and diplomats from distant countries.
His books, that he found time to write despite the turbulent diplomacy, were the unique combination of a colossal erudition and comprehend the clarity of the ball.
His academic background and his donations to the rhetoric is, one to form a very unique.
Rarely a small country has been represented by a man of state of such magnitude: only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts can support the comparison.
It was a true patriot, formerly of the term: proud of its people without being however, ethnocentric, rights of the world but deeply rooted in the Jewish cultural heritage, which focused on the plight and the tribulations of the Jewish people, but never lose sight of universal humanity.
In a word, it was a modern Jewish in the best sense.
It has often been stated that the prime minister, Levi Eshkol spoke seven languages, all in Yiddish.
Of Eban, one could say that it was ten and all with a focus of Oxford and Cambridge.
However, which were on the outside world was not always an advantage at the heart of harsh and the collapse of Israeli politics.
Eban was probably too refined, too academic and rights of the world to reach the flying, as well expressed Disraeli, until the end of the mast of plenty.
Accompanied by Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan, it was obliged to leave the government in 1974 after the Yom war.
He could hardly be held responsible for the hubris that triggered an avalanche of 1973, but these events, however, drove his downfall.
It has never been able to return to power and when he was facing the new policy of primary and populism, it failed shot because he could not cope with this new style.
In the international arena, the pen of Eban him took place on the sword and the floor was his.
It was less clever in internal political battles in Israel.
It could be a fighter hard on the turf, but it is fairer to say that it would have been able to fight harder to defend his convictions and dovish moderate in the government post-1967, which he took part.
It is not clear whether he would have prevailed given his lack of independent political base, but its prestige and his reputation at international level could give him a chance if he had chosen to take up the gauntlet.
It never happened.
The silence of Eban in recent years was not only generated by his disillusionment with the Israeli policy in his declining health.
In a period where the public debate in Israel are torn between fanatics and the nationalist pseudo-religieux anti-Zionists draw masquerading as the post-modernistes, the moral certainties of Eban, driven by good manners, can seem superficial.
But for a country, it is essential to have a certain moral force and Eban has offered in abundance to its people and the world.
Although it has passed several years since I spoke to Eban, I do not have doubted for one second of the fact that it would have been extremely sad to see how were the events after the failure of the Camp David talks and Taba in 2000-2001 and conduct adopted by the Israeli policy, it would seem a bad omen.
However, in all likelihood it would have been even more disappointed by the inability of the Palestinians to reach agreement on the existence of the Jewish state.
As a pro-Arab by its training, in the culture of Arab and Muslim culture, it has always hoped that the past Arab glorious could be become younger, a growing Arab and Muslim tolerance could triumph of fanaticism and extremism.
This was the basis of his hope for reconciliation between Jews and Arabs.
This revival of Arabic, to use the expression of the great George Antonius Palestinian University, has not given the day could be the biggest disappointment of Eban.
Despite the image of a man of the world of Eban gave, it was extremely vulnerable: what some might regard sometimes traits of pride could learn from its source of his humble origins.
While speaking in an English very carefully, Eban was not born in a castle: it came from a section of anglo-juifs.
It was, in the real sense, a "self-made", whose courage, ambition, dynamism and a deep faith in his fate have led to the summit.
His spirit economy were sailing in the rarefied atmosphere.
In this, Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he was so gloriously.

A Handbook on the Israeli hawks
The announcement of the Prime Minister Ariel Sharon showing its willingness to dismantle the Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and some West Bank settlements has shocked and wrong-footed the nation of Israel and the nations of the world.
Many have denounced the Sharon plan as a stratgème.
But this surprise was crazy since the beginning.
Despite the appearance that they give to foreigners, the debate in Israel on the future of the occupied territories have never been reduced to a simple story of hawks and doves.
As anything else in Israel, the process is more complex, particularly when the Hawks are concerned.
Overall, there are two species of Israeli hawks: the ideological and the strategic.
The Hawks ideological view the occupied territories as part of the Earth history of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories of Jewish Heritage, which explains their insistence on the West Bank by its historical Hebrew name: the judée and samarie.
The Hawks ideological are not all religious, although those who are based their claim on promises and divine prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists and their jargon is similar to the Nationalists types of Eastern Europe and Central Europe.
The former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to this category.
The Hawks ideological are generally at the national party and the Likud.
They are inspired by a nationalist ideology associated with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded the Zionism "revisionist" in order to defy the more moderate version passed by the founding fathers of Israel, especially Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion.
Then the Hawks strategic.
For them, given the form geographically close and vulnerable to Israel and the hatred of Arabs, control of the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but responds to safety concerns.
For them, the Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to the historical land, but are strongholds of security to prevent (or to push for a place more strategic) an attack at the heart of Israel.
This assessment of the situation may be right or wrong, but it certainly is not ideological.
Ariel Sharon, who has a military background (he grew up in a social environment whose ideas were more to the Labour Party as Jabotinsky), is a strategic Falcon.
For the Hawks ideological, the compromise is a betrayal: how could jeopardise the historical heritage of the Jewish people, without mentioning the word of God of Abraham?
The Hawks strategic, however, are open to negotiation and compromise practices, if the circumstances it is appropriate and if the safety concerns are justified in their eyes.
It is in this context that must be considered the measures taken by Sharon.
He was elected on the promise that it would bring peace and security.
He got neither.
With the defeat and the disappearance of Saddam Hussein, the danger of a 'eastern front "against Israel has weakened.
Without a Palestinian partner, and because of the Palestinian terrorism continued that the actions of Israel's persistent, fail to quell the measures taken by Sharon this ideas for the strategy: build an effective barrier, to shift some of the settlements and strategically unsustainable, and wait.
The statements of Sharon during the previous year seem to follow a model well defined.
First, he admitted that "one day", a Palestinian state would make its appearance, an idea unthinkable for the Hawks ideologically pure.
A few months later, it has shocked her supporters at the conference of the Likud party by declaring that the occupation was unacceptable and unsustainable, another shock to those who had always talked of territories, "released" rather than "occupied territories".
In December, it has explicitly stated that Israel was looking a unilateral ceasefire that would inevitably "resettlement" of some settlements.
Although these statements that were once again that a simple verbiage, they have created a language again for a Likud prime minister.
The latest statements of Sharon, however, have explicitly named the settlements to be evacuated, the director of national security council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed chairman of a committee of rehousing responsible for drawing up plans to evacuate settlements and to provide compensation for the settlers relogés.
This has radically altered the political map inside Israel.
Some of the Hawks ideologies of the government of Sharon have threatened to resign; Shimon Peres has announced that the Labour party would give Sharon a safety net member; it is also question the Labour Party to join a unity government.
The test is obviously not planning, but the implementation of the withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.
The choice of time by Ariel Sharon, may have been guided by the problems they encounter following police inquiries about his alleged corruption.
However, anyone who wanted to predict the future of Sharon must remember that in contrast to begin and Shamir, Sharon has a military history and that for him, security, not ideology, come first.
His apparent pragmatism cannot therefore be surprising.

The Justice League of Iraq.
Saddam Hussein is dead, but all Iraqis are happy.
Instead, how different ethnic and religious groups have reacted to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty in maintaining the cohesion of Iraq.
For the Shiite majority, long violently suppressed by Saddam Hussein and with all previous Iraqi Sunni religious regimes, the death of Saddam symbolises their conquest of the political leadership.
Moreover, their expressions of jubilation triumphalist are a cruel reminder of how the oppressed, once released, can easily become oppressors.
For the Sunni minority, out of power by the American invasion and expresses his frustration by the daily attacks against the Shiite population and its holy places, Saddam remains a hero for long.
The Kurds -- as Shiites, have suffered the wrath of Saddam Hussein for decades -- discreetly cling to their independence, while making what is needed to ensure that they will never again be subject to an Arab regime.
The Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who represents the Shia and Kurdish coalition in power, has expressed his hope that the implementation of the dictator will overcome sectarian divisions.
But even if his words seem sincere, the reality leads to the opposite direction, and the verbal exchange offensive for the execution even help not to forget that it was the justice of the winners -- not in America, but the Shiites.
These events do not bode well for the future of what we should get used to appoint "ex-irak."
À truth, the current debate in Washington on stabilizing Iraq is inappropriate because we cannot stabilise something which no longer exists -- in this case, Iraq as a État sovereign.
Under the guise of constitutional amendments inspired by the United States, the Shiite majority has managed to capture almost absolute power.
It is and what appeared to be in Washington, a few months ago, a successful transition to a representative government is a farce: as under Saddam, the authority depends on the arms control. The difference is that today the government no longer has the monopoly of violence.
Each of the militia, each ministry, each Shiite political faction has its own weapons, its wholesale arm and death squads, while the Sunnis continue to use stockpiles of weapons accumulated under Saddam Hussein for fighting a rearguard action against the new order, apparently legitimized by the elections.
À except for a new violent dictatorship, no authority is to gather the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds in one political entity.
The idle dream of the American administration - democracy in one night a deeply divided society and accustomed to violence or coercion -- has released a terrifying aftermath of demons.
In these circumstances, the ensuing debate the Baker-Hamilton report in Washington has little bearing on the future of Iraq, although it remains essential to the future of power, prestige and status of us in the world.
Iraq's future will be decided by the Iraqis, but by the bullet and not of ballot papers.
The US and all of the international community are completely impréparés to confront the Middle Eastern version of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences.
And unlike États from the breakup of Yugoslavia, which could draw inspiration from Europe, the lack of a legitimate Arab Democratic model makes it more difficult even for a democratic order.
Some Europeans and others can mockery of the failure of the US in Iraq, and the insanity -- or worse - their desperate policy following the occupation.
And yet the underlying reasons for this failure goes back much further, to the creation of all parts of Iraq in the 1920s by the authorities British imperialist, which pooled three disparate provinces of the Ottoman Empire conquered in a État which has never had any coherent identity.
The foundation of Iraq itself is based on Justice winners: the British Empire, having defeated the Ottomans, has given the power to the Sunni Arabs in a country where they were a minority.
Today, this arrangement is délite following a new round of Justice of the winners.
The consequences of this review of power are not yet clear.
But it is certain that an Iraqi État consistent, whether it be unified, federal or Confederation, will emerge from a company whose part, justifiably, Saddam Hussein as a bloody dictator, and another part of the revered as a hero and martyr.
The wars have unintended consequences and cruel ironies.
In Iraq, it is now becoming apparent that some États cannot be saved without being destroyed.

The battle of the European Union to Turkey.
When the conspirators behind the suicide bombings in Istanbul began their human bombs against synagogues and the buildings of British offices, they had different audiences in mind.
The European Union citizens that the political class is under pressure to join the earlier represent one of these public, possibly the most important.
The battle within the European Union about Turkey's entry will take place on many fronts: in the country itself, where the government is currently undertaking major reforms to qualify for entry into the European Union, at the table as soon as the European Council in December 2004 allows the Commission to open formal negotiations for admission to the European Union and in the public in the country already states.
Three of these fronts, the last is the most demanding.
Most of the European Union citizens are uncomfortable today at the idea of Turkey's entry into the Union.
The leaders of the atrocities of Istanbul, may have calculated that the Islamic terrorism to increase this malaise.
By tradition, the European citizens have always accepted the new members are pressing the door to join the club when it comes from the group of six countries of origin in 25 countries that it will bring together in the European Union in 2004.
Once purely Western community, the union has rejected its borders in all directions.
From next year, it will stretch in northern Finland to Cyprus and Malta in the south of Ireland in the West to the Baltic États.
While the people truly have often fears that the newcomers get their jobs and their subsidies, they have always come to accept.
But Turkey is different.
The 10 new countries in Europe next year, and even the Balkan country now are being offered the possibility of belonging to the future, are all in a traditional definition of Europe.
None of them is to worry about the current balance of the EU.
None of this is in Turkey.
Apart from a narrow strip of land, its territory belongs to Asia, and not in Europe, its culture is Islamic, and not Christian, and if it had to join in 2013, for example, its population will be far more important and the youngest of all EU member countries.
Moreover, the Turkish border with countries such as Iran, Iraq and Syria, Turkey would bring to the European Union a neighbourhood disturbing: a part of the world unable to develop a regional peace in his own head, an outpost of fundamentalism and Islamic terrorism, a patchwork of États fragile crack of nationalism, an area of conflict on the militarisation, even nuclear power, a region where the États-unis remain involved strategically and Israel will always be the concentration of anti-Western feelings.
Turkey entering the union, the EU will become part of a wider Middle East waved and disturbing, the most provocative in the world today.
And yet, it is precisely because of the implications that the benefits that represent the arrival of Turkey within the EU and far outweigh the risks that it represents.
First, the possibility of a future entry into the union is the most powerful force for the modernization of Turkey, and a modern Turkey, democratic and prosperous is essential to Europe, whether inside or outside the union.
Moreover, to enter the EU a kind of moderate Islam as now in Turkey will be of importance to the integration of Muslim minorities of European countries already large and growing even without the input of the population of Turkey.
Finally, with the opportunities provided Turkey with its Islamic traditions, contacts, its resources and geography, the EU will be better positioned to exert a stabilising influence on a region which inevitably affect the security of Europe.
These are powerful arguments.
The big question is if they are powerful enough to influence the European public scepticism.
It would only one country on the 30 states that the EU is perhaps in 2013 to prevent the accession of Turkey.
Some countries, without doubt, will want to speak to their people through a referendum that will leave the decision on people, not only in parliament.
Even in Germany, where the constitution does not allow referendums, calls the referendum in the case of Turkey's entry and an opposition party has already announced he will do a central issue of the election campaign next year for the European Parliament elections.
Once the public unease with Turkey can reach a point of focus on the referendum for the entry if the country in the EU, there will have little chance that it can enter.
À the end of the negotiations, it will be perhaps that Turkey is ready for Europe but that Europe is not yet ready for Turkey.
This is why the battle for the entry of Turkey has already started and that the terrorists of Istanbul appear to be understood.
Those who believe that the EU will be beneficial for Turkey as well as for Europe must also engage in the battle to defend their ideas.
There would be nothing worse for Turkey and Europe that European governments welcome Turkey and failing to convince their populations.
The terrorists will undoubtedly continue to stir up the fears of Europeans timid against Turkey.
Hope that at the end, attacks against innocent people crowded the streets of Istanbul do not feed fears of Europeans, but rather a sense of solidarity with this dynamic country and moderate, a common enemy.

The high fences are bad neighbours in Europe
Good fences make good neighbours, as the poet Robert Frost.
Unfortunately, the European Union seems to take the poetic fantasy of Frost as an important political order.
Indeed, how the European Union preparing to host the citizens of the ten countries join in May?
Just in a puff of the nose and build the laws of protection for forcing them to stay out first.
In fact, the union is even worse.
Since there is no agreement at European level on the rules to implement the new EU citizens, each member country makes its own regulations without any coordination.
Some of these regulations in development are draconian.
Austria and Germany - until now the two largest recipients of immigration from Eastern Europe, with the four fifth - announced last year that they would restrict migration from the new États states for the duration of the transition period, seven years.
France and Belgium restreindront immigration of new European Union citizens during the first two years of the transition period, at least.
Sweden appeared to have adopted a liberal position in the first time, but will now open its borders and could reduce the access of immigrants to the social aid.
The Danish government almost collapsed in January when the Ministry of Labor proposed to open the labour market to all new EU citizens who can provide proof that they have found a job.
Greece and Italy have remained silent until now, which probably means that they will retain the current restrictions to the new États states: they will be effectively treated the same as every immigrant outside the EU.
Thus, all the countries bordering the new États states will close to the migration from the "new Europe".
All these dams reflect the general concern mounts to the citizens of New États states passengers to take advantage of generous welfare systems.
Not surprising then that falls to the most spectacular of popular support for the expansion is registered by the European polls in the EU countries benefiting from the services of social care the most generous.
But the support to enlargement subsides everywhere, on the threshold of entry for new countries.
Meanwhile, close the door on its citizens the most recent will not solve the problem of access to social services and will certainly be harm economic growth.
On the labour markets in the European Union who are characterised by low mobility, such as those that exist in Western Europe or in southern Europe, the migrants can play a very important role.
By increasing productivity average, they contribute not only to boost growth, but also to meet the income per head higher.
In fact, distortions in the definition of wages - often set without any real correspondence with the levels of productivity in the workforce locale- the immigrant workers even contribute to reduce the unemployment rate in western and southern Europe.
Moreover, close the door will not solve the problem of access to social support as illegal immigration is a threat worse than legal immigration: it uses the resources available without any help in return for social aid even though the bulk of immigrants are young and work.
The best way to deal with the fear of immigration as a source of abuse for the social systems is to adopt quotas transitional common and rather generous at EU level, then remove them quickly if they are not met.
The quota of migration is preferable to another kind of restriction because they allow at least part of the potential benefits in terms of social support from immigration should be made.
Quotas could be determined according to the historical periods of strong immigration, according to an annual flow of 400,000 people for the European Union.
While these restrictions transitional are implemented, the reforms must be taken to address the issues behind the public's fears about immigration.
The root of this fear, of course is in the vast differences in income that exist between the citizens of Lithuania, for example, and those of most EU countries.
Of course, economic convergence is a long haul.
Thus, the policies of redistribution of the European Union should be reformed to discourage people from poorer countries to do emplette welfare.
The problem remains the incompatibility Social Security, where the aid that it receives are based on the contributions, and the social support programmes, which involve transfers in cash.
All the European Union countries as well as new members must be encouraged to adapt their social support programmes (which are also present in the new member states), so that they meet all to certain basic requirements.
A minimum income guarantee in the European Union will gradually be put in place with the intention, in the long term, setting up a safety net throughout the European Union and forming one of its institutional pillars.

The challenges of Calderón
Mexico has finally found a new president last Friday in the circumstances of bad omens.
Felipe Calderón was sworn in, braving the anger of his left-wing opposition, and is showing more clever than the party of the Revolución Democrática (PRD) and its leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, but to avoid paying the high price.
All the emissions of television and one of the world have displayed the same headlines: "The New Mexican president comes to power in the chaos and violence."
The Mexican institutions have resisted in the attacks of a left-wing opposition virtually insurgent, acharnait in vain to prevent the appointment of Calderón, and the bitterness of a Revolucionario Institucional Party (PRI), decided to leave Calderón take power, before fail miserably.
If Calderón has overcome dramatically the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that jonchaient the path to the presidency, the fight to govern and transform Mexico would start.
Most journalists Mexicans believe that it should be relatively easy for Calderón to do better than was the failure in large part auto-infligé of outgoing President Vicente Fox.
Mexico has a need for growth around two times faster than he has known as Fox (a small 2% per year).
If Calderón can strengthen the law and order and use its considerable political capacity to reach an agreement with the PRI on structural economic reforms, it will succeed.
But it is a simplistic.
The mandate of Fox, as well as the last four years of the president Ernesto Zedillo, have not really been a failure.
Mexico had not experienced economic stability, low inflation, low interest rates, currency and steady growth, although poor, ten years of non-stop since the 1960s.
For the first time, mortgages, auto loans and consumer credit become accessible to sections of the lower middle class: This year, it has built and sold more houses and bought more cars than ever before.
Similarly, although one can blame Fox has not silenced the protesters and opposition to extremist and disruptive, there has never resorted to the bloody crackdown that has made famous most of its predecessors.
Moreover, it has managed to Mexico to its bosom archaic in terms of foreign affairs and has pushed immigration and human rights at the heart of the New Mexican international programme.
Calderón do not think that negotiating with the PRI is an easy task, and it fails to make a coalition government, he believes to be the solution to the deadlock in Mexico sits since 1997.
Whatever the benefits of a cabinet comprising only members of his party Acción Nacional (PAN), this is not what was looking for Calderón.
Similarly, it proved impossible to reach any agreement with the opposition in what was the inauguration, hence the scenes so chaotic that depressing to members of Congress fighting for the house, while Calderón was quick with a back door for a ceremony rushed through in haste.
The economic problems of Mexico could prove too much more intractable than seem to think of many journalists.
Mexico has experienced a sharp economic opening in the former President Carlos Salinas in 1988-1994, a political opening delayed but successful under President Zedillo in 1994-2000, and, finally, a rotation of powers by Fox.
But the foundations of the old system pri-corporatiste created in the 1930s remained intact and represent the obstacles the most impressive and the greatest growth and success of Mexico.
The first pillar of this system is formed by the public and private monopolies dominate the country.
The oil companies like Pemex and electric (Comisión Federal of elecricidad) managed by the État have no competitors.
The private monopolies of telecommunications Telmex), television (lock, (Cemex cement, the manufacture of bread and tortilla (respectively bimbo and maseca) and the bank (Banamex / Citigroup and Bancomer / Banco Bilbao) perhaps have to compete abroad, but not at national level.
These monopolies are stronger than ever, and prices, supplies, the service and the quality will suffer.
The second pillar is formed by the unions who control the movement of workers in Mexico since the 1930s.
They have powers to hiring and firing workers non-syndiqués, elect leaders by acclamation, receive mandatory contributions without transparency and a huge political power.
The Union of Teachers is the largest in Latin America, the union of oil workers is the richest and the employees of social security to thwart any attempt to reform pensions and health for years.
The third pillar of the system is the political monopoly.
For 70 years, the PRI has completely controlled the Mexican political; today they are three parties to do, and nobody else can enter the political arena or have access to the huge public subsidies -- more than $500 million last year -- without their consent.
The main parties write their own antitrust, vote for their own subsidies, and choose their own elected.
The absence of re-election in a row at any level strengthens the power of the machinery of the party: they are the choices of candidates, voters are only ratify at the ballot.
The challenges of Mexico are to release the movement of workers, break the private monopolies and open public monopolies to competition, and to lower barriers to entry restricting access to the political arena.
This may not be sufficient conditions for success, but they are certainly needed.
Calderón has to strengthen his presidency at the beginning.
Take possession of power is perhaps the only way to achieve that, even though it may seem risky.
Élu with only 35% of votes, without a majority in Congress, and with a power grab on the eve of an economic slowdown in the États-unis, things are very difficult.
Étant given that roughly one-third of the electorate think it won in the wrong, and given the uncertainty of État of law in the country, the position of Calderón is even less enviable.
The caution and patience is in any event would probably not his best advisors.

The challenge of Mr Chávez
The recent parliamentary elections held in Venezuela have confirmed the trend that has placed the country to one of all the newspapers in recent years.
President Hugo Chávez has demonstrated once again that he enjoys broad support among the poor and desperate, and he has a good measure ahead of his opposition in terms of political skills, skill and ruthless character.
However, there is a drop in attendance polls as each new election organised under the mandate of Mr Chávez and regularity dubious elections have become increasingly visible.
It is certain that the withdrawal of opposition to a few days of the election was rather like the proclaimed Mr Chávez, a symptom of his own weaknesses rather than the problems of electoral process.
And it is almost certain that this same weakness is part of choking phase-out of some aspects of Venezuelan democracy.
Even so, the mistakes of the opposition have been very important, ranging from supporting the coup d État missed against Mr Chávez, democratically elected in April 2002 attacks without result against pedevsa, the national oil company of Venezuela, in early 2003.
There is nothing more dangerous in politics that the failure of direct confrontations.
In such circumstances, Mr Chávez can afford to be bold, despite its policy failures when it comes to act in favour of its electoral base: the 50% or more of Venezuelans who live in poverty and despair.
Poverty has increased since Mr Chávez came to power in 1998: the budget of the État and the balance of trade are even more at the mercy of oil revenues today that this was the case in the past, and, apart from the Cuban literacy programs and outreach services' doctors underfoot, naked, "the whole public health of poor people has stagnated, if not worse.
It is highly likely that the future will not bring any major change.
Mr Chávez will change much of the constitution at will and parachute in his men in the judicial system and the electoral authorities.
It will continue to distribute subsidies from the oil revenues in the well-worn tradition of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Carlos Andrés Pérez.
So, Mr Chávez can get elected again next year and could well stay in power until the end of the following decade.
But if this is what the Venezuelan people want, so be it.
It is, after all, according to decide who will govern, and how, as long as human rights are not systematically violated or the democratic institutions suspended indefinitely, and that international standards of conduct of affairs are respected.
According to this last point, at least, Mr Chávez was perhaps more than it is allowed.
For years, has accused of taking the torch of Fidel Castro in supporting a radical rhetoric and anti-imperialist revolutionary, not to say, throughout Latin America.
Perhaps it is time now for the nations in Latin America and the international community to take these allegations very seriously.
Mr Chávez distributes oil to the nations of the Caribbean Islands and Cuba and repurchased debt Argentina to support the policy of President Nestor Kirchner.
À Mar del Plata in Argentina last month, he has openly participated in a rally against the free trade area of the Americas (FTAA), in the company, among others, Evo Morales, the Bolivian leader of the growers of coca leaf, which could well become the next president of Bolivia.
Similarly, Mr Chávez openly supports Daniel Ortega, the perennial nominee for the presidential elections and shafick Nicaraguan Handal, another perennial candidate of the FMLN in El Salvador.
His former ambassador to Mexico City has openly participated with vehemence on certain nights of presidential election campaign, the mayor of Mexico City, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
It seems that the foreign policy of Mr Chávez along a main theme: the provocation of a major confrontation with the États-unis.
The danger, of course, that when this happens, if it happens, either on the subject of Bolivia, the FTAA, human rights or press freedom, it will be too late to the master.
The challenge is to prevent the confrontation that Mr Chávez clearly wants to provoke.
Unfortunately, the government of George Bush has never been very keen to prevent conflict.
The other nations of the hemisphere, have a direct interest to prevent a fight that would force them to take advantage and could even threaten their economic interests and national security.
Although many positions of Mr Chávez has received some support from several nations in Latin America, the division he created in Latin America, with the help of Cuba's Castro between left and right, between the defenders of free trade and the "bolivaristes" between the pro- and anti-American, is essentially artificial, but certainly not impossible to overcome.
Certainly, many Latin American leaders tried to appease and control of Mr Chávez, without result.
It could be very expensive to try.
The last time revolutionaries are opposed to the États-unis, in Central America, in the 1980s, everyone is lost.
Divisions in the hemisphere, created by a leader of the oil revenue, would be much much more catastrophic.

The État-nation revisited
Now it is fashionable to say that the État-nation has lost its place.
Globalisation, it means that the nations can no longer control their own affairs.
They must unite to others, as in the European Union, ASEAN or Mercosur, and count more with the international institutions like the United Nations, World Bank and the World Trade Organisation.
Such a point of view is risky.
Indeed, when we look more closely, it is suspect, or simply wrong.
The État-nation, with its strengths and weaknesses, is alive and well.
To begin with its strong points, the État-nation remains the only space policy, which manages to the constitution of freedom.
The Democratic credentials from organisations such as the EU are dubious, and totally absent in the case of United Nations and other global institutions.
In addition, despite research frequent new identities, European, Latin America or another, and despite numerous references to a new cosmopolitanism, or even a "global civil society," most people feel at home in their own country, the État-nation which they are citizens.
Migration is usually led to other countries.
Many countries is currently debating the integration of immigrants.
What needs to be British, German or American?
Such discussions on immigration will have a sense that if we acknowledge that citizenship is defined by and for the nations.
It is, for most people, the positive side of the État-nation.
The État-nation was for more than two centuries and continues to be the reference of belonging and civic involvement for most of human beings.
This is the context in which we see our freedoms protected or destroyed.
The country free of communism in 1989, must have felt that restore national sovereignty and regain the freedom were closely linked.
But there are, and there has always been, another aspect, most despicable, État-nation: it is nationalism.
The nationalist can be aggressive or defensive, directed against the other or internally oriented.
In both cases, it corrupts any attempt to create an international community of open societies.
It was the problem in Iraq: a État-nation became a troublemaker in the region and beyond.
More recently, a phenomenon is less violent but equally worrying has gained ground: the revival of protectionism.
The Doha round of trade talks is blocked because developing countries refused to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries, which in turn are trying to protect their fledgling industries.
Many would rather privileged relations to open trade.
In this area, the EU has often been helpful.
But today, the nationalist virus has infected up to the European Union.
France, Spain and Poland have tried to maintain strong their main industries in the 'hands. "
Suddenly, the single European market is forgotten, and a return to the fragmented markets takes root.
Consider, for example, the 'directives on services "of the European Commission.
Although the freedom of movement of workers is one of the "four freedoms," the single market, many EU countries are trying to protect their domestic labour markets by suspending freedom as long as possible.
Germany, in particular, argues that the high rate of unemployment resulting from the reunification in 1990 he needed to close its labour market to new États-membres.
Such trends are dangerous.
Historically, protectionism has often led to clashes, which can quickly degenerate into conflict.
The signs are not good, even in Europe.
A recent summit of EU leaders had the energy policy -- is not only a very desirable, but necessary.
But even the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, clearly pro-European, went to the meeting with the explicit intention to put a brake on the creation of other European powers in this area.
The agreement Russian-German gas pipeline skirting around Poland and Lithuania, with the former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder as leader of game, has already contributed to the deterioration of relations between Poland and Germany, without mentioning the European cooperation.
During a time, the pendulum of public opinion has been dangling too far to the État-nation and its role.
This is one reason why so many people felt detached from their political leaders.
But it is unfortunate, and even dangerous, that the pendulum will return to nationalism.
The États-nations are welcome, they are important elements of a liberal world order.
But they must be open to cooperation and coordination with the other.
We must resist the birth of a trend that recalls the events of the first years of the twentieth century, a trend that's lead on a global disaster.

Gordon Brown eligible?
Obviously, Gordon Brown wants to succeed Tony Blair as British prime minister.
It is less clear is that he is ready to make the necessary to lead the Labour Party to victory in the coming parliamentary elections.
Indeed, it has to renege on Blair's legacy, which, at least means promise to leave Britain for the Iraq war.
Brown covets the office of prime minister since 12 May 1994, fateful day when John Smith, the Labor Party leader then in opposition, died of a heart attack.
Two weeks later, on 31 May, Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London and have discussed the person who should take the party's leadership.
À the end of their discussion, they have reached a double agreement: Brown would stay away and would support Blair, who engaged in return to be replaced later.
The fact that they have not agreed on the time or the circumstances of the transfer of power was also inevitable that decisive.
They could not predict that Blair was going to win three successive election victories in 1997, 2001 and 2005, unprecedented for their party, and keep and Labour in power for a period which was likely to last 13 years.
The défi-clé for New Labour (according to the relookage Blair who has used its donation feature for manipulation) was the management of the British economy.
Since the second world war, most of the UK governments have tried to manipulate the economy to promote their party in the short term, collecting generally disastrous results in the long term.
This pathetic tradition was common to the Tories and Labour, and yet as unfair as it sounds, it is Labour was the most affected by a reputation for inability to economic management.
Brown has changed this reputation decisively.
It was probably the minister of the Économie most remarkable in British history, which is not because the inspiration or genius, but simply because it has created a new tradition, giving priority to moderate inflation, interest rates low and stable government finances.
Brown has understood that these priorities were essential, not just for the British economy, but also for the long-term objectives of the Labour party in power; and it has promoted the programme by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility to keep inflation low.
The result was that Britain has seen a decade without precedent, marked by low inflation and a relatively high economic growth, overtaking in this area, many of its European counterparts.
However, despite the economic success, it has become increasingly clear that Blair was over.
Voters have gradually lost their faith in the inevitable flaws of a government too familiar, and the party is increasingly unhappy with a leader who were abused his hospitality.
Initially, Blair thought he could claim the right to stay in power for a third five-year term.
But the pressure he has suffered to leave and has continued to grow, so that he has promised to go to summer 2007.
Nobody knows exactly when or how Blair will give way.
If a formal competition for the leadership of the party rules, it seems likely that several candidates will be on the ranks.
That said, almost all the observer in authority in the area seem to agree to appoint Brown as far more likely to become the next Labour prime minister.
This is for the easy.
À from here, nobody seems to have the certainty that Brown knows what to do or has the capacity to lead and to win new legislative elections for Labour.
Its reputation for command and control of the economy is as well as undisputed, but he has not given almost no indication of what they think of other government's policies.
It was cold and almost silent, apparently eager to get his legacy, but gave no indication on what would change if there were.
If there is something he cannot promise is to continue the policy of Blair.
If Brown chooses the continuity, it will lose.
After ten years of Blair, it must offer one or several policies that will mark a clear divide.
The choice of policy change the most obvious concerns Iraq: if Brown to win an election as leader of Labour, it must abandon the politics of Blair and announce the quick withdrawal of British troops.
In terms of tactics, it should be as easy as clear: whatever spurious grounds and illegal data at the start as an excuse to invade Iraq, everyone now knows that this war was a political disaster, strategic and moral.
Everyone knows that it cannot be won, "if it means something, and Brown knows that both war and the slavish submission of Britain to the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in the country.
It is the problem that it is the most urgent need to address: but for now, none of the main political parties has dared to touch it.
Over the past three weeks, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Conservatives have all held their annual conference.
All have focused on national policies, no one dared to address the subject of Iraq, because they all know that it would raise the issue of the withdrawal, which in turn would provoke a major debate and possible explosive on relations between Britain and the États-unis.
Brown will be brave enough to confront the issue of Iraq?
Probably not.
It may very well decide that it is too difficult, and it will only be a caretaker prime minister, condemned to lead the last three years of Labour without any hope of winning the next elections.
This is not what he had planned in passing its market with Blair in 1994.

The latest innovations in the economy
The Great Depression propulsa John Maynard Keynes on the scene of economic thinking.
According to Keynes, private investment is inherently unstable because of the modes and engouements passengers among investors, changes in the "Animal Spirits" businessmen or because falling prices may disrupt the economic system.
Keynesians believed that the monetary policies prudent (the central banks raising or lowering interest rates to reduce the fluctuations of private investment) can take part in stabilising the economy.
But they believed that the government would agree to be directly involved, with generous tax policies, to keep the overall level of spending in a stable economy.
Such a policy, pensaient-ils, bannirait forever the spectre of mass unemployment, as happened during the Great Depression.
It could possibly also guarantee full employment.
They expected the almost full employment would push up the threat of inflation.
After all, why workers and unions should reduce their demands on pay if governments are spending every time the threat of unemployment as well as?
A restriction of the requirements for high wages (the fear of being made redundant when unemployment will rise) had also jumped.
What can replace it?
For the first postwar generation, the predominant response was that the shop the Social Democrats would replace.
The unions are pliaient requirements of the government to rein in their own demands for wage increase and the governments have plieraient the requirements of the trade unions on public spending and social benefits.
The thought of Keynesian assures us that the great depression cannot happen again.
But his solution to the rampant inflation does not bring up the road and utterly collapsed in the 1970s.
À following the first inflationary crisis of the 1970s in the major industrialised countries, the predominant economic thinking in these countries turned to the "semi-monétaristes."
The victory of Milton Friedman has never been as comprehensive as it was the Keynesians.
However, in the mid-1980s, politicians of the world match on the following points.
Central banks should engage with credibility on price stability in the long term.
Central banks should accept that the average rate of unemployment is determined not by factors "cyclical" but by structural factors that they should not try to resolve.
And try to maintain a goal of monetary growth is an easy way for the central bank to disclose its intentions main, to gain credibility and give the people outside a way of checking if sound policies are followed.
Monetarism was that the image reversed the Keynesianism.
It seemed to ensure that inflation in the 1970s could never happen again.
But it offers no solution in structural unemployment problem which was apparent in Western Europe.
The last 15 years have shown that monetarism is poorly equipped to handle the challenges of falling prices in the context of companies and banks heavily in debt as the Keynesian solution was not made to handle the challenges of inflation.
In the 1970s and 1980s some, including myself, placed the bankruptcy of Democrats to control inflation on the wrong decisions.
Politicians had not understood that the increase in social benefits was the price to pay inevitably for lower wages, while the trades union leaders had not understood that if the corporate social democracy is not limited inflation, the political power would be right and rising unemployment would be used to the limit.
Today, is still on the other bad decisions in the current severe economic conditions at the heart of the developed world (more than a decade of stagnation in Japan, accompanied by deflation, deflation also present in Germany, accompanied by recession).
The European central banks and Japan have not dropped their interest rates sufficiently or early enough: the regulators of the banking sector have turned the caprices of loans and politicians have refused to extend the tax policies.
But politicians and central bankers may not always be seen as capable of making good decisions. The right policies must be designed to operate despite the lack of vision and good advice of leaders.
Inflation in the 1970s was a failure normal savings Keynesian policies.
Deflation threat to Japan, Europe and perhaps even the États-unis a long period of irréconciliation between the production potential and actual production is a failure of semi-monétariste orthodoxy that has dominated the macroeconomic policies at the heart of the industrialised world since the early 1980s.
We are going around in circles.
Without forming a circle: no government would allow the repetition of the collapse of liquidity as it occurred in the 1930s or the collapse of banks and businesses on a scale to put the entire economic system at risk.
This is a spiral.
The macroeconomic problems in the world are real but will not lead to another Great Depression, largely because politicians remembers the first great depression.
We need a new revolution of economic policies on the way Keynesian and semi-monétariste, a revolution that will not lose (quite) of the successes of the previous revolutions, but will eliminate their intrinsic failings.
Which may well come the revolution?
Perhaps of Ben Bernanke, the new governor of the Federal Reserve, whose long career has always been concerned in asset prices, the role of adverse selection on the credit market and the need for central banks in trouble not only the current operations in the short term on the markets open.
He believes firmly that the banks should try to pave the way long-term investments in action.
Bernankéisme you said?

The fate of mankind / the hopes of humanity
For some time now, and certainly since the terrorist attacks against the États-unis on 11 September 2001, as in the past when we saw the killing of Kosovo, Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Rwanda and Congo on our televisions, the new cannot talk of war or threats of war, violent deaths or threats of violent deaths.
Throughout the world, we are all very clear about the power of our weapons.
Nuclear missiles to head up the trucks full of fertilisers or explosives brought to the belt, we used our technological capacity to develop much the dark side of our nature of biological species violent, the role of predator.
I certainly have no intention to minimize or reject this aspect of human history and current events.
I do not want people forget that over half the previous century has gone for some to kill by bullets, gas, stab, burning or starve a tenth of men living on this planet, either because of the first world war and famine that followed the great leap of Mao.
However, it is not a complete overview.
In fact, the people of the twentieth century — and the various slaughterhouses that preparing various communities as of today — may not appear in the future as the most important part of our experience and our human condition, or what our descendants will regard as their history.
For them, the most important features of our experience may be.
Overall, the 20th century remains in many parts of the world remained desperately poor because of one or several reasons: (1) a criminal governance; (2) a lack of machinery, useful and productive in the global economy out of subsistence agriculture and industry sous-qualifiée services; (3) a public education system absent, which could make the public education and skills needed for the use of these machines; (4) barriers (legal and physical) to prevent people, where demand is low, to sell the product of their work where demand is high.
However, towards the end of the twentieth century, these four reasons behind the poor have generally been reduced.
The governments such as Kim Jong Il in North Korea are very rare these days.
Almost all countries of the world are no more than a generation of literacy nearly universal.
The speed of technological progress has created a cornucopia of invention and innovation, open to all regions, which can send a student get a diploma from engineer.
And, above all the barriers to prevent the goods produced in Mauritius, Mozambique and Mauritania are sold in New York or Berlin and Santiago or Tokyo fall quickly.
The enormous cargo which apparurent on the seas recently have revolutionised the world trade in a generation.
The new information technologies used in the management of means of transport and distribution will probably be the same impact.
The advent of the Internet and technology fibre-optic cable will as the global industry services side that did the introduction of ships steam iron hull hundred fifty years earlier for international trade of agricultural and industrial goods.
Certainly there will be a generation for these changes is felt throughout the world.
However, at the heart of the industrialised world of rich countries, there is already these revolutions appearing on the horizon.
In fact these concerns will be strengthened and aiguiseront as fears of the citizens of these rich countries when the barriers of international trade will fall and the redistribution of wealth, the social order and the political world of the industrialised world will be insensitive to their foundations.
For the whole world, however, the next two generations of those who provide extraordinary opportunities for economic growth and prosperity.
There may well have a boot to the Treasury at the end of history, after all.

The defeat of Argentine néoliberalisme
In the 1990s, Argentina set of policies that belonged to almost 80% of neoliberal programme.
It opened its economy to trade and the international capital; it sought to ensure low inflation and a stable currency.
It is efforça to improve its legal system so that its decisions are in agreement with international laws to generate some confidence when the respect of contract law, with or without bribes.
This has not market.
However, nobody can say that the 1990s were catastrophic, despite their consequences that led the dreadful summer of 2002.
Life is far more difficult during the Dirty War of the 1970s, when an Army stripped of all credit led the women of high of helicopters in the Atlantic Ocean south and the urban guerrilla warfare to the people because... because... well, simply because!
The 1980s were little better.
Opening up by a crisis of debt at its height caused by a massive rise in the US interest rates and the dollar's value, the decade resulted in a hyper-inflation generated from within, caused a decline of a decade in Argentina, lagging behind the leading economies.
During the 1990s, by contrast, GDP per head of Argentina increased by 25%, with highs and lows, only to lose all of that profit growth over the last four years.
Until the end of last winter, the problems of Argentina seemed to be little more than a à-coup unpleasant but temporary, as the crisis of the "Mexico's tequila" over the years or even the crises of the East Asia in the years 1997-1998 turned out to be mere heckling face short-term and not turning points.
Such optimism is impossible these days, and there is little hope that the recent stock market crash of the country did that temporary effects.
The opinions of institutions, such as the secretary of État American in the economy, John Taylor, is that the collapse of Argentina is due to its political class.
I do not share this view in part.
The leaders of Argentina were warned repeatedly that maintaining a constant exchange rates and the annexation of the peso to the dollar could cause a recession if the dollar's value was rising.
The Argentine politicians were also warned that their policy of the peso could not be sustained without the relationship between the national debt to GDP will fall.
However, during the boom years, between 1993 and 1998, public spending dépassèrent enough tax revenue to get the debt-to-GDP ratio of 29 to 44%.
When the dollar rose and that the recession has gone, politicians of little big unable to balance the budget of the État in time have not shown enough courage to balance the budget when the situation is hardening.
The final blow was dealt with the government decided (in full crisis) to keep the bank deposits fixed rate in dollar and putting the debt from banks in pesos, putting it into bankruptcy, the entire financial system of the nation by a stroke of a pen.
The position of the ruling class is simple: If any of these three disastrous measures had been taken, Argentina would not be entered into crisis, or would, at worst, suffered a mini crisis of the type of Mexico.
The programme neoliberal Argentina in the 1990s was, according to this view, but politicians Argentines gave the image of a large community of astute imbeciles.
There are, however, another way to see the Argentina.
If you consider that the country's political system has long been very predictable, producing with regularity, governments that promised more than they could implement.
That promise to the wealthy oligarchs not to levy taxes too high.
That promise to workers and consumers a generous social insurance system.
That promise a rapid economic development, infrastructure spending and jobs more compelling and enjoyable for those who have political relations, etc.
Overall, these promise indicated that any view on the national product excédait always full of 100%.
Popular demand demanding that the government meets all can never be satisfied.
Add to it an unfair distribution of wealth and income, the lack of social commitment between the middle class and the working class and a long tradition of political violence, and there is the perfect cocktail of a policy where all oppose all.
The political battle for the distribution of wealth in Argentina remains to be resolved.
Any political force which will try to manipulate the auction by promising that it can do is doomed to defeat.
And, in Argentina, the big budget deficits are a law of nature, a fact determined.
The Argentine interest rates cannot fall and be affordable for only a short and rare periods of time.
Everyone knows that the political system from Argentina is a chronic deficit, and we know that this does that indicate that the debt interest payments were sentenced to explode.
The fact of the absolute lack of stability of the dynamics of debt, Argentina, indexing the exchange rate on a strong currency could not continue.
Free access to international capital markets and bank accounts in dollar mean that when the index for the exchange rate would come into conflict with the logic of Argentine politics producer of deficit, the result could only be catastrophic.
If the current crisis was skillfully manipulated, if Argentina had experienced another decade of rapid growth, conflicts of the redistribution of wealth would have been moderates.
After all, Europe before the second world war was proof of the worst political world: the riots of right-wing gather in France to general strikes in Britain through the civil war in Spain and fascism in Italy, without mentioning the aggressive consolidation of power in Germany by the Nazis.
And yet, Western Europe's postwar never encountered any problems of public order which found a solution while maintaining a strong currency and growth.
I do not share this view, however.
Yes, the Argentine government has made significant errors, its politicians have sinned against the gods of the economy.
But the punishment should be so strong and tough?

The false promises of private pensions
One of the most bizarre statements made during the debates on the social insurance from now on the richest countries in the world is that pension schemes funded by governments and whose achievements are fixed (such as the social security system in America) are outmoded.
These programmes were enough, according to this argument, at the time of the Great Depression and for the generation of the après-deuxième world war, when the economy was based on industry, but they have become obsolete in the economy, high tech, network, post-industrial today.
Defenders of this argument offer a different model.
The companies agree today to support the pensions of employees in contributing to their private savings and current governments should offer (or demand) to help the private savings.
The value of these accounts vary according to the market and is not based on a system of benefits set, which provides a real sets of resources available at the time of retirement.
This argument is strange because it takes the economic situation in range.
When many companies offer their employees of pension benefits to long-term fixed, the government has no interest in establishing a parallel system of fixed retirement benefits and to ask employees to participate.
After all, in that context, employees who attach great importance to a fixed retirement benefits can go to work for companies that offer such systems.
The key advantages of a system where the government requires employees to participate as a social security system is combined for employees who should really attach great importance to the pension system to fixed benefits to determine their preferences.
They are also combined for employees who do not have the ability to negotiate to get their bosses to provide pensions that they want and that they really need.
There are few companies now ready to offer pension benefits fixed long-term.
One reason is that companies today are much more aware of their own fragility in the long term than they were in the years following the second world war.
Even the États-unis IBM, which prides itself on its stability, does not take the risk to provide retirement benefits.
The risk of pension benefits usually fixed was offset by two benefits for companies offering these systems.
First, the fact that leave the firm was usually the reversement this savings with a décote increases the accuracy of employees.
Then, the assumption optimistic accountants complacent about the benefits of reserves of retirement, associated with the ability of large companies to take greater risks, improved the balance sheet that companies could submit to their investors.
Today, the risks are seen as much bigger and the benefits as well.
This fact, employers are fewer and fewer to offer systems that are so far in pension benefits.
This reduction systems at fixed benefits in all the rich countries of the global economy is not good, because the configuration of the prices of goods suggest that people young and middle-aged attach great importance to the benefits.
Historically, the gap between the profits expected on goods at a lower risk such that the Treasury or the good investment and property at high risk such that the actions or real estate was generally very high.
In sum, as some economists, including Robert Barro at Harvard, and some mathematicians, such as Benedict mendelbrot, it may be due to risky investments are much more risky than suggested by the theories and the mathematics of financial technology standard.
In my opinion, at least, this is partly due to the memory of the 1930s and 2000, when the stock market has suffered greatly, which occupies a place too much in the spirit of investors.
The employees and other holders of goods is an important value to the safety and predictability, also a system of fixed their retirement benefits is very valuable.
But in the world today, only national governments are big enough to implement such systems and ensure that pensions will genuinely be available when employees will end their activity.
I am yet bias to believe that if there is an economic service or an advantage which people attach great importance and that only the government can offer, then it is her duty to provide it.
We know, economists, there are many disadvantages to push the government out of its role which is to provide real public services such as defence, security and justice, while offering people incentives to offset the effects of the real market failures.
Where the private market has the flexibility of two hands, the bureaucracy of government does more than two inches.
But the collection of taxes on wages to tens of millions of employees and the writing of tens of millions of cheques for retirement is part of routine tasks, semi-automatiques that the government may well do.
When private companies are pulling out of systems to fixed benefits, it is even more important and valuable as the government realises, while our post-industrial society in the era of networks, that it was in the past.

Islamist movements and the paradox of Democratic
The wave of anger that is stirring up the Arab world after the publication in Denmark, a few months, cartoons, representing the Prophet Mohammed, the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of the Iranian regime of "political Islam," a fundamental problem on the international scene.
But there can be a single answer to all the issues that arise.
It must abandon the idea that there is an Islamist movement monolithic.
Islam has various forms that have emerged as the main alternative to the Arab regimes and secular nationalists whose legitimacy, based on the national liberation struggle, disappeared from their inability to solve the economic and social problems, the rule of law and ensure the fundamental freedoms.
In Palestine, for example, Islamists have won on Fatah because they have suffered for years its bad governance whilst suffering hardships due to Israeli occupation
Long ago, America and Europe share a deep-seated fear of "The Islamic alternative" to the nationalist leaders and secular as Fatah and defend the status quo.
But the Monarchs and dictators secular Arab crushed any opposition, mosques, the only place from which the political commitment was possible.
Today, political Islam may not be content, because we cannot build democracy in rebuffing underground parties who have a strong social basis. This was tragically illustrated the example of Algeria 15 years ago.
The only alternative to authoritarianism is to achieve a transition that will allow the Islamists to participate in political life, while encouraging them to accept unequivocally the Democratic rules of the game.
In many countries, the Islamist parties, more or less, Conservatives are ready to play the game.
This is no coincidence if they are represented in the parliaments of all the countries who have committed political reforms, whether in Lebanon where Hezbollah is now within a democratically elected government, Jordan and Morocco.
In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood have become a force to be reckoned with parliament, despite the limits imposed on the participation of Islamist groups in elections last year.
In Iraq, free elections have revealed the huge influence of Islamic movements.
In Turkey, the democratic transition brought to power an Islamist party, the ruling Justice and Development.
Under his conduct, the Turkish government has taken various democratic reforms and began negotiations on Turkey's admission to the EU.
The Islamist parties have nothing to do with Al Qaeda, even if some of the most conservative elements within them are ideological positions that may be closer.
The risk of a political transition that will lead the victory of the Islamist parties is a paradox of democracy that Europe and America must accept if they want to encourage a policy that includes all the political sensitivities – in other words to the exact opposite to the imposition of democracy as it has held in Iraq, under occupation of foreign troops.
One of the most negative consequences of intervention in Iraq was to reinforce the notion of "clash of civilizations" between the West and Islam, which creates a climate conducive to the Islamic movements.
The Muslim world has made political reforms, well before the "war against terrorism" and the reformists Muslims have not waited for the EU is becoming a political pressure to act.
Such movements have not been created in the United States or in Europe after the September 11, and they do not expect a signal or help them to act.
The success of moderate Muslims, risk, however, depending on the attitude of EU and US to them.
It is not necessary to show that democracy is the best way for Palestinians if they want to create their state.
It depends largely on the direction that will take the new government of Hamas, which will or not in a Democratic strength, respectful of the law, democracy and international law.
But that will depend on Israel and the international community should do everything in their power to the emergence of a future Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital.
Promote democracy with the Palestinians will not prevent the international community to ask Hamas to abandon its terrorism, to demilitarise, to comply with the Palestinian constitution and recognize Israel's existence.
But it does not mean that we should impose sanctions on the Palestinian people after speaking democratically.
If you want to strengthen the recent Palestinian democracy, it would be a terrible mistake that would have a negative impact in the other Arab countries seeking to reform.
Similarly, recognise the right of the violent Islamist parties not to participate in political life does not mean the shift in political and ideological struggle to overcome the ultra-conservatrices and sometimes totalitarian society.
To combat racism, defend the tolerance and respect the religious feelings of others is not to question the press freedom or to accept the censorship that call for Islamic militants, even if authentic religious feelings are hurt, as in the Danish cartoons.
The Islamists of society that violate the individual rights must be rebutted politically.
The political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy, because it allows all the ideas to travel freely in competition with each other.
Political Islam is a risk, but we can reduce that by developing a strategy, even if, and in the sense of democracy, but not in denouncing the results of a Democratic choice.

The war against the "democratization"
The wars in Lebanon and Gaza threaten the democratic reform in the southern Mediterranean.
They are inflicting heavy penalties precisely the people of the region that have led free and fair elections, and they undermine the legitimacy of democracy to Israel.
Last year, the "Cedar Revolution" has done in Lebanon as an example of democracy in the Arab world.
The enthusiasm with which the international community has welcomed these changes has fallen flat. The elections that recently took place in Palestine -- other long-standing international -- are in the same scenario.
The message is clear: it is better that Israel, the only country in the region to meet the État of law, is surrounded by authoritarian regimes where the election results are predictable, rather than Democratic États where militants are likely to gain power.
It happened in Palestine and this could well happen in Egypt if elections are conducted in free and fair.
The Arab nationalist governments could justify the resistance to political reforms and the repression of any internal opposition, in particular, growing Islamic movements.
It is now clear to everyone that the democratization of the southern Mediterranean cannot remove Islamist movements and that the success of the process depends largely on the degree to which the participation of these movements is guaranteed in the political arena.
Of course we still need to renounce violence as a means of accession to power.
Contain political Islam, or try to "eliminate" the Islamists in the military without taking account of the national political process (and not to mention human lives), is not a solution, because the voters made not Islamic movements.
The efforts of governments reformists in the region to integrate these movements in the public sphere have received a severe blow.
Democracies are long ago that the heavy reprisals imposed without distinction -- which, by definition affect both the allies that the enemies, the fighters as civilians -- is a serious violation of international law, as has seen Louise Arbour, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
They also know that such actions are stirring up radicalism and have the impact that we know only too well today.
Hezbollah is, after all, a creature of the resistance of Lebanon to the invasion of Israel in 1982. The "Party of God" is trying to apply to new home and in the region by presenting itself as the defender of the Islamic cause, particularly in Palestine.
Any strengthening of its power, will in fact Lebanon and the democratic forces in the region.
The absence extended for a real active engagement of the United States in the Middle East peace process is partly responsible for the current morass.
For nearly six years, they have not taken to diplomatic initiative weight to resolve the Palestinian issue, nor to follow the Syrian track (Israel is still in the Golan Heights).
Moreover, even as we begin to think that the tragedy of Iraq had lifted the veil on the limits of unilateral disarmament and preventive military strategies, the Bush administration encourages the Israeli military action -- this time against a country trying painfully to consolidate its democratic reform and to reaffirm its sovereignty on Syria.
The initiative, the most promising to Bush, to promote democracy throughout the middle way, was paralyzed by the intervention in Iraq and by the civil war that followed.
The project is now crushed under the weight of the inability to protect the fragile democracy in Lebanon and the democratic experience of Palestine.
The reaction unconvincing on the European Union in the conflict in Gaza and Lebanon somewhere between the understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate response to Israel (not "an eye for eye," but "ten eye for an eye," according to the presidency of the EU Council), revealing how the EU depends on us to put an end to violence.
If the present conflict does not encourage people to speak with one voice, that means they have learned nothing from the disunity, the weakness that has damaged during the war in Iraq.
It is that a European initiative backed by means of credible military deterrent, combining the strengths of the EU, Turkey and the Arab countries, is dispatchée in Lebanon and Gaza under a UN mission.
Europe must not only demand an immediate ceasefire and end the interference of Syria and Iran in Lebanon, but it must also have the means to translate its requirements in the facts and make a massive aid to the reconstruction of Lebanon.
The EU must support the end of the embargo on Palestine and the creation of a Palestinian État urgent.
A common European front could persuade the United States to allow enough time in Lebanon and Palestine to consolidate their democratic processes, and to isolate the radical elements of Hamas and Hezbollah to dissolve his private army.
The American project is in ruins, a European policy credible de-legitimizing of war and support for democracy in the region is crucial.

The environment of the economy
No economy is a universe closed, independent, governed by laws, independent of the law, morality and politics.
The economic issues of the most interesting tend to be on the border with neighbouring disciplines.
This cannot be made clearer than in the interaction between economic processes and the environment.
The peculiarity of this exchange is not to be governed by the laws of mechanics, but by those of thermodynamics, particularly the law of entropy that the amount of free energy that can be transformed into a mechanical work diminishes over time -- an irreversible process culminating in the "death of heat."
At the behest of Nicholas georgescu-roegen - whose work on the relationship between economic processes and the physical were pioneers - many researchers tried without success to make a theory "entropique" of the economy and society, especially during the 1970s.
The point of view entropique assume that because of its multiple interactions with nature, economic processes produce irreversible consequences.
We represent in the stocks of non-renewable natural resources (oil and mineral resources, for example) and dégradons or modify quality other resources (for example, water and agricultural land) by imposing a exploitation rates higher than their ability to regenerate.
The exploitation of resources to release the "speed" of economic growth rate environment, which contributes to the deterioration of the biosphere, especially by climate change irreversible.
The law of entropy reminds us that we will pass along to future generations a natural heritage less and less suited to their needs that we have inherited.
Unfortunately, there is no easy solutions.
On behalf of what principle might be asked to China and India to limit their economic dynamism to reduce their collection on natural resources of the planet?
The weaker growth in developed countries is not the consequence of a voluntary restraint, but our standard of living far higher and our inability to deal with our own economic imbalances.
We cannot impose the poor that the pace ecological, while it is to be released that has enriched.
For a similar reason, "or even stagnation is not a solution in the developed world: it would be that handles the inequalities, either by a regime of redistribution to équirépartition resources.
This would be the choice between a cynical unsustainable and a utopia.
But, fortunately for us, our evolution depends not only the entropy, but also the increase of knowledge and technical progress -- a process as inevitable that the decline in stocks of resources and environmental degradation.
And the economy has a entropique for resources and historic for production, the organization and dissemination of knowledge. The prospects for sustainable development in economic and environmental terms in the area developed between these two processes; the level of growth that you choose should be based on a level of knowledge enough to ensure the survival of the system.
But the nature and knowledge are public goods that require the intervention of the state to be "products" in sufficient quantities.
The only way out the problem of the finitude of our world is to maintain an area as big as possible between entropy and history by investing in education and research in the prospect of increasing the share of renewable energy, reduce energy consumption is linked to our standard of living and slow the pace of exploitation of natural resources.
Such a strategy may seem pointless if it only serves to withdraw to allow others to enrich themselves more quickly.
But as for control of two dynamics, the solution of ecological constraints could be a boost to growth.

The race for embryonic stem cells continues
Scientific research is generally taken to improve our lives, but it is also an industry, an industry that represents a huge investment from governments and companies.
The stakes and the potential benefits of some research subjects, few are exceptionally high, and this is why the recent announcement that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk has made its results of research on stem cells have experienced such a response.
The episode highlights the continued international medical research that is unfolding in the field of stem cells.
This is probably the biggest challenges of any medical history that is accessible to everyone, and everybody, all the world could win the jackpot.
The last great scientific games of this type dates back to the time of the human genome initiative, which promises to change the future of radically.
This study was launched by the États-unis from discoveries in the wake of nuclear bombing of Japan on the understanding of the scope of genetic damage to long term.
The effort to research done on embryonic cells and their potential is just as important because it will allow a full medical revolution, just as important.
An embryonic cells is special because it can reproduce the form which is different.
When a cell of our skin or liver, for example, cannot replicate more skin or liver, embryonic stem cells, which are more robust at the beginning of human development, are cells "prototype".
When an egg fertilisé turns into embryos and fetuses, these cells are original show somehow to cells that produce can turn into skin, eye, liver or blood.
We need to find out how this transformation is unleashed.
Such knowledge would lead to enormous progress that could give rise to patents.
A strong attention is focused on the genetic diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and muscular dystrophy.
In these cases, stem cells would be used to repair the nerve tissue.
This would also benefit for patients with brain damage or the backbone, any patient who suffered an attack and paralysis.
This déborderait in parallel fields, such as gene therapy.
A cell embryonic changes of identity via a process of "outbreak", a signal that literally active the gene in the liver cell embryonic version of the cell.
When researchers have understood how to activate these switches, it may be possible to introduce embryonic stem cells in the human body and the drive to replace the damaged tissue.
Not surprisingly, given its huge potential, that teams of researchers have rallied almost everywhere to engage in research on stem cells.
This race has gained some momentum since the main player in research, the États-unis, are available, because of the influence of religion on the policy (even if the État of California has decided not to deny and recently approved a subsidy of $3 million for research on embryonic stem cell).
The promise is so large, science has no need for a massive infrastructure, many small countries who have engouffrés in the vacuum created by the États-unis in this area for it.
All relevant medical research centre may engage in this race, that is in Mexico, in Éthiopie, Indonesia or in Yemen.
The winner can bring to his country's economy the equivalent of a Saudi oil.
But, even if everyone can win, science, at this level, is not a simple 'eureka' or a simple step that would suddenly put an end to this race.
The findings are progressive, and, because this is science, each step is announced and tested.
This is how the institutions participating in research can gain momentum, that the leaders attract talent, resources and prestige in an intellectual environment which is not easy.
There is in the competition in many other small shops, jostling to produce quick results and impressive.
In May 2005, the research centre of Hwang in Seoul did a first success.
They claimed to have developed a technique when new embryonic stem cells in perfect condition could be cloned from ordinary cells.
It was the new high-profile, because they had a sufficient number of embryonic stem cells could be created without having to controversy, thus allowing everyone to do research quality while avoiding that US President George W. Bush has described as "the use of a life to save a life."
In addition, the Koreans are then switched to a stage features of our days and have called for the patent rights of the process.
You could almost believe for a time that South Korea would become the superpouvoir global health issues.
We know now that researchers have invented the Koreans.
The survey conducted by an investigative panel of Seoul National University concluded that stem cells "cloned" were actually created by the in vitro fertilisation.
The fraud has surprised the scientific community, particularly the fact that the declaration of researchers Koreans was so clearly unworkable.
Why did they even put their careers and reputations at stake?
Medical research has always had to face many challenges, even when the pursuit of science is a matter of discovery.
Today, the challenges are more complicated policy, market forces and national interests.
With embryo research, vast fortunes depend on the group which will take the head, where that is his laboratory.
While the competition is heating up, we must await developments drugs, and no doubt of subterfuge in terms of public relations.

Islamic and Chinese diaspora Asian
When the prime minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir Mohamed, recently announced that it intends to resign, the Malays of Chinese origin, has joined the party loyalists of the Malays Mahathir, asking him to reconsider its position.
When Mahathir has agreed to stay, even just for 16 months, sighs of relief in the Malaysian Chinese were the more audible.
The fact that ethnic Malays, Chinese have rallied on the side of Dr Mahathir gave a quiet revolution in the political unrest which demonstrates how the image nationalist Mahathir has relaxed during his 22 years in power.
It also shows how the Chinese Ethnic have changed their opinion on the nationalist movement, which previously was hostile.
In the overthrow of colonial leaders of Southeast Asia four decades ago, the Chinese Ethnic often have fled the nationalist movement fighting for independence.
Some movements, saw the Chinese local as foreigners or as people inherently unfair to have benefited from years of imperial rule disproportionately.
The mob violence anti-China movements was widespread in the region.
In the decades that followed, most of the Chinese have continued to be wary of political parties linked to the old national liberation movements.
That fear is waning in Malaysia.
Chinese citizens to Malaysia now consider the prime minister Mahathir as a bulwark against a new form of violent extremism: the threat posed by Islamic fundamentalism.
Such a bulwark is a necessity for members of the vast Chinese diaspora across south-east Asia, not only in Malaysia, where Islamic extremism remains a threat, but also in Indonesia, where thousands of Chinese were killed and injured in riots in recent years and where thousands of others have seen their properties damaged or lost.
Most of the ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia admired as a valuable presence even a hint of allegiance to a centuries-old distinction between faith and the state in a Muslim ruler.
When this distinction in the Islamic believers as Mahathir, evidence of an age-old tolerance is a rare signs of modernity and commitment to progress.
Dr Mahathir has always been a modernizer in the cool head.
It has recently started to acknowledge that the politicians' the Malays first, "he has encouraged since 1969, have failed to give birth to an elite malaise described to a new modern economy.
Mahathir called the young Malays to work harder, even if it is fully aware that such an appeal is unpopular.
A large part of this new tone in the ethnic policies of Malaysia went unnoticed because of the uproar surrounding the efforts made by Mahathir to discredit her former member, Anwar Ibrahim.
The campaign against Mr Anwar has cost the party of Mahathir, the United Malay National Organisation (onmu), much of his support among ethnic Malays.
Indeed, in national elections in 1999, Mahathir has retained power only thanks to voters.
The non-Malays hope now that it will reconsider the idea of special treatment for ethnic Malays.
Such reform is still anathema to figure among the Malays.
The Chinese ethnic Malaysia are also impressed by the response clever of Dr Mahathir US demands to fight against terrorism.
The Prime Minister has used this opportunity to soften his image of man against the West by reaffirming its position modernizer and secular against all those who sympathisaient with Islamic extremism.
In this way, it has revitalised the multicultural national alliance that has led Malaysia since independence was proclaimed in 1957.
All this has enabled him to win the Chinese community in Malaysia on its side.
Put this situation, in contrast with the Chinese to Indonesia, a country where everything that is ancient and modern is associated with political and cultural compliance with the nation state.
For 30 years, former President Suharto has consistently drawn a racial discrimination against the Chinese Ethnic while promoting a few privileged comrades who have led to his family and his fellow soldiers to make huge profits badly.
In the eyes of the indigenous majority remained poor, such favouritism portrayed the Chinese people greedy, corrupt and unscrupulous businessmen.
Despite the memories of the massacre of Chinese during the anti-communist purges of the 1960s, the Chinese Indonesia were not prepared to confront hatred huge deployed during the riots in May 1998 where arson and looting and rape of a number of Chinese women have ravaged the Chinese community.
Such violence casts a shadow on the ethnic relations in Indonesia.
The Indonesian successive governments controlled by the presidents Habibie, Abdulrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri were all encouraged the Chinese to play a role in the past role in commerce.
However, Indonesian officials are reluctant to ensure the Chinese that they will equal rights as citizens and they have allowed various forms of discrimination to crack down.
The current tensions between the sécularistes, religious believers and various extremist groups Muslims in Indonesia have rejected the Chinese in the shade, so many of them to resume their economic role in conditions of uncertainty.
But the personal safety that they want and that the Chinese Ethnic Malaysia are going to get still remains as distant as ever.
Indeed, it is highly unlikely that Indonesia produce a leader on which they could count on the same way that the Chinese in Malaysia are now on the prime minister Mahathir.

Football and philosophy
Gooooal!!!
Serenity God, or brûlure roaring, according to the team which marks: the us or them.
How the trajectory of a ball could be responsible for both happiness or pain?
I have spent weeks sitting in front of my television watching the World Cup.
My wife threatens to divorce and take other disciplinary action.
What is the source of this attraction, the Magic?
The world of the game is the perennial garden of Eden.
You can at any time from our reality for freedom, the innocence and the happiness of the game.
The football and the Garden of Eden?
What do they have in common?
It defines a sphere sacred freedom and order of innocence, spirituality and justice in our world day of chaos, slave-trading, unfair and punishing.
The board, the tennis, the football ground: in their area, we feel free, because in these places, we decide the rules without being subject to the iron laws of the outside world.
It is innocent, too, because the world of the game is also a world of innocence: a Garden of Eden of before the fall.
Here we can be childish and selfish, we can satisfy our need for success, power and dominion, and all this without any guilt.
In the world of the game, freedom is generated, paradoxically, by the restrictions.
Football, the basic rule is simple: the ball should move, the central point to the nets of one of two cages of purpose.
If the balloon was heading directly from the central point to a cage, his path would be, or would appear to be strictly defined and all would be pretty boring.
To create a degree of freedom, the regulation comes in the way the ball is managed to make the trip.
First, two teams of 11 players are placed on the ground with the task of putting the ball into the cage of goals.
Then, they are asked to put the ball in the cage of the goals of the other side.
Thanks to the 22 players with their skills and their own, thanks to various movements of confrontation and cooperation, the number of possible combination is so high.
Following this, it is just one more factor to create a real world of happy surprises, freedom and happiness: the ball.
The balls are the most important in the creation of freedom "in our lives.
A ball, it is freedom personified.
It can pick up in any direction.
It seems to be provided a will own.
It is a subject, and yet, it seems to be free.
With the introduction of an element of chance and unpredictability in the game, the ball into a fight human embittered and in a épiphanie spirituality and freedom.
According to its loud, chance and the men will interact, dance and somersaults with one another.
The ball flies from here is full of carefree irresponsibility, between the desire of men and the chance, freedom and the restriction, the success and failure, the hope and despair, to pick up in the world of hope in the next time.
It has its own universe.
He moves in the sphere of sacred.
But the sacred does not exist without the secular.
The ground of football is limited and opposed to the outside world.
The experience and the sacred ceremony would be incomplete if the tension between the ground and the gallery did not exist.
The ground of emerald and freedom of the game should be in opposition to the crowd hurlante in the darkness of the gallery, the Red burning torches and sudden travelling between the joyous ecstasy and misery stupidity.
In the lives of our lives, the reason and passions intertwine.
The football (as in other sports) between these two areas and opposed.
All the passion, emotions and the instincts are forced to viewers.
They enragent and extolled by, pavanent and explode, and finally the catharsis (if their team wins) or the Underworld (if their team loses).
Meanwhile, they are watching, and the experience of freedom platonic or apollonienne game taking place on the ground.
Yes, the players moving in a world of spirituality.
They are acting according to clear rules, sacred.
When they play, they are supposed to act in rational beings, who leaves behind the passions and emotions, fears and the wishes of their intimate life.
They meuvent in a world of morality and justice.
The world of the player is a world full of justice and fairness, equality of opportunity, that we never daily.
Even the meaning of the wind is controlled.
The two teams are changing their hand at half-time.
Where and when do we see the privileged, and the need to change the side in the real world?
The players, too, are not supposed to depart from the rules.
If they do, they are punished, and if they do, they are excluded from the game.
They are excluded from the sphere of spirituality and we see them disappear in the underworld chill of the changing room.
The expulsion short of paradise is that if the holiness of the game has been desecrated, if the fate is broken: the players robbed of their role angelic and embarking on a fight on the ground, by a referee to deceive you, by the public understanding that a match was arranged by the spectators invading the pitch.
Such events are a long time the public and community.
It is a bitter about the fragility of our world of freedom, spirituality, dignity and then waking up again (as we do when the winner of the World Cup will be known) in our world, nothing less than hostile.

Egypt needs a president, not a pharaoh
A heated debate on the current political reforms in Egypt.
Emanant all opposition parties and civil society groups, it focuses on a request to amend the constitution in 1971 and abolishing the state of emergency declared in 1981après Sadat's assassination.
These demands are nothing new.
President Mubarak and the national Democratic party that backs are against since the mid-1980s.
But, given the alarming turn of events in Egypt, in the region and beyond, the need for reform is now a compelling character.
The 76 years of President Mubarak and his health is a source of concern.
The rumours about this run for years, but they have been confirmed officially in November 2003, when there was no longer possible to hide the situation.
While it was addressed to parliament, Mubarak has gone under the eyes of millions of viewers.
Although it is returned an hour later to finish his speech, the Egyptians were demanding more transparency, both in terms of the health of the president that the operation of the État.
Meanwhile, the worsening economic situation, high unemployment and widespread corruption have led to despair part of youth.
More than half of the Egyptian people was born under the presidency of Mubarak.
A recent UN report, half of young people between 15 and 30 years ago dream to emigrate to Europe, North America and Australia.
Every week, reports speak of Egyptians who drown in the Mediterranean while trying to cross illegally to Europe.
A few weeks, several young people have died of suffocation and directed them to Egypt in trucks carrying who crossed the Libyan desert.
This case has led to protests that have forced the authorities to stop, questioned and bring to justice the Egyptian police officers responsible for the facts.
The situation in the region and in the world has made the opposition more daring, not only to demand reforms, but also to amend the articles of the constitution relating to the presidency.
Rumours are persistent, Mubarak, who has already been re-elected four times, would seek to obtain a sixth term or to establish a hereditary Republic. "he prepares his son Gamal, 41 years, successor to the image of the Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and his son Bashar.
The battle of the opposition is not, not the re-election of Gamal Mubarak and not for him to follow.
Many Egyptians have nothing against Gamal Mubarak as such, but they are mortified at the idea that after having undergone the father for 24 years, they may be the son for the same length.
On 211 articles of the current constitution, which date of October 1971, 30 relate to the presidency.
The appointment of the president by a two-thirds majority of the People's Assembly is then ratified by a plebiscite, which we can say yes or no.
The presidential term of six years ago, given the simple majority, is renewable indefinitely in this way.
The lax procedures to be truly with the extent of presidential power.
The president is both head of state and commander-in-chief, will chair the Supreme Council of the judiciary, police and council of ministers. It is at its discretion name and withdrawing one or several deputies.
He appoints the prime minister and key ministers and approved the appointment of other ministers, ambassadors and senior civil servants.
It may call for general elections, say the war, to declare emergency rule and enact decrees that have the force of law.
There is no balance of power.
An article that "the president can be impeached for treason or any other criminal act if a motion tabled by at least one third of members of House of the people is approved by two thirds of them."
The president is suspended from duty and replaced by Vice-President pending the conclusion of the process.
But Mubarak has never passed the law needed to implement this article or even appointed a vice-president, despite repeated requests from all sides.
This has resulted in a de facto "imperial presidency" with Mubarak in place of the pharaoh.
No other head of state of modern history is in its hands as much power.
In Egypt, compared to in Brezhnev who has presided over two decades of stagnation and the decline of the Soviet Union.
Similarly, the position of Egypt as a regional power collapsed under Mubarak.
On the economic front, the flow of foreign investments have plummeted to 3 billion per year in the mid-1990s to some ridiculous 300 million in 2003.
The demands for reform now focus on the president is elected by universal suffrage with at least two candidates and the prohibition of more than two consecutive terms.
But it should also reduce the presidential power in what he was abusive and create effective mechanisms for all government officials without exception have to account for their actions.
If Mubarak and his government do nothing for constitutional amendments claimed to be adopted, more and more Egyptians will flee the regime and will risk their lives to seek refuge elsewhere.

Bush should not play in the Gulf
President Bush urged Americans not to "play politics" in this period of terrible national disaster.
But ask awkward questions to the leaders of our nation is exactly what is democracy, when the government's response to Hurricane Katrina is widely regarded as "a disgrace."
Katrina has announced his arrival at least two days in advance, but the authorities have been slow to launch an evacuation order.
No way of transport was available for those who had no money or car; the reception and care for the refugees were inadequate, the necessary forces were not in place to deliver the supplies essential or to ensure the next, and the number of boats, helicopters and other equipment needed to rescue those who would find themselves blocked was far enough.
Hampered by a National Guard, including 40% are in Iraq, the speed of mobilisation of the military in the areas most affected has been slow.
For four days, there is simply had no central control orders and clear.
Consequently, many victims have suffered and died.
This is largely attributable to the policies of the Bush administration, which has effectively been eroded the capabilities of the Federal Emergency Management (Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA), government agency whose primary mission is to manage the disasters.
Obsessed by the war against terrorism and by the ideology of privatisation of government functions, the administration has systematically undermined the ability of the FEMA to prevent the disasters in the long term or at least to soften the blow when prevention is still possible.
The FEMA has been restricted and demoted to his Cabinet, before being placed under the auspices of the Department of national security.
Its mission of planning and preparation to disasters has been completely sidelined for the benefit of the fight against terrorists.
Its leaders have no experience of disaster management.
The director precedent was one of the cronies Texan policies of Bush, and the skills of the current director include the task of commissioner with the judges and the service of the International Arabian Horse Association, where he was forced to resign for "lack of supervision."
Since 2001, billions of dollars have been postponed for aid to disaster management to national security and the war in Iraq.
The programmes-clés relief disaster have seen their budget melt like snow in the sun and the federal funds have been reduced by half.
The budget for the Army Corps of Engineers to build levees in New Orleans was looted, particularly the funds specifically allocated to flood control urban southwest Louisiana.
The prevention measures aimed at protecting the population and the properties have not been implemented despite the conclusions of the FEMA even in 2001, specifying that a major hurricane that hit New Orleans was one of three "disasters, the more likely and the most catastrophic which could hit this country."
Convinced that the FEMA was a "social programme disproportionate" and that "the government's job is not to provide services," the first director of the FEMA of Bush has set up the requirements of supply outside under a major effort of privatisation.
This phenomenon has led to a brain drain because many of the FEMA are geared to the private sector.
The privatisation has also put the États and the poorest communities in a particularly vulnerable.
À measure that funding is tarissaient and that the federal programmes were called in the hands of private companies to higher fares, only the États and communities, the richest and politically important had the means to claim the rare federal benefits to pay for services.
For example, Florida (which has 16 more voice that Louisiana and the governor is the brother of President) has received the funding required to protect its wetlands.
In contrast, Louisiana, which needs more (with his incredible poverty rate of 24%), has seen in 2004, denied his request to fund to prevent floods.
Étant given that the ability of Louisiana to protect itself was weakened and the management of disaster undermined the inadequate response to the government and the destruction of unnecessary were almost inevitable. And this is the poor have paid the price.
But the reasons for the failure of this administration exceed the diversion of resources and chronic voluntary schemes to protect the people of disasters.
Despite the scientific evidence proving that the intensity and the increasing frequency of hurricanes are linked to climate change, the Bush administration rejects any participation in international programmes aimed at protecting the climate.
Rather than comply with the ban of wetlands established by previous administrations, Bush has chosen to remove it.
The erosion caused by urban development has brought about 30 km, the Gulf of Mexico land in 1965, the Hurricanes are able to concentrate more power and wind and waves at the speed and the destructive power always stronger.
The reduction of wetlands was threatening levees in New Orleans, built on the principle that 60 to 80 km of wetlands patrons play the role of buffer between the city and the Gulf of Mexico.
Despite all the major studies showing that a rehabilitation programme of the coast of large scale and construction of dams highest was necessary to protect New Orleans, the government has allowed the federal agencies to stop protecting 8,000 hectares of swamps, the promoters to drain hundreds of acres and in 2004 has cut more than 80% funding to keep the waters of Lake Pontchartrain.
New Orleans has sounded the alarm bells for America.
The ideologies of privatisation, which are unable to govern effectively and allow the privileged to save their skin while poor people to climb on the roofs, must now be called into question.
This disaster is a reminder of what happens when government fails to protect its citizens, and it is imperative that the Americans are asking the accounts.
The officials who have not done their work must be returned, and elected representatives whose policies have aggravated the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina dismissed.
We owe it to the deaths and the survivors.

The autumn of Comandante
Only Gabriel Garcia marques would find the right words to describe the expectations of the death of Fidel Castro.
His novel the autumn of the patriarch perfectly capture the moral poverty, the political paralysis and the boredom fierce, which ensevelit a society until the death of a dictator in the long way.
The departure of the power of the Comandante Fidel is only a matter of biology, and the rare photographs of him that have appeared since he fell ill last year clearly show the nature at work.
When the end will come, the change in Cuba may well have so much that any of those who have welcomed the end of the great dictators of the last century.
Stalin, Franco Tito, Mao: their ways and means similar all.
The way they emerged from the scene has often been very different, however, and these differences permeate the companies for years and decades after their death.
Take the example of the Soviet Union.
On 9 March 1953, the Gulf of Finland to the sea of Baring, everything is arrested, as in Warsaw, Budapest, Prague and East Berlin.
À Beijing, Mao Zedong himself salua low an enormous effigy of Joseph Stalin.
Huge crowds in mourning, bereaved, almost hysterical, épanchèrent in the vast empire which Stalin had prevailed.
And yet, in a few days, the word Stalinism was removed from a new dictionary, and three years later my grandfather, Nikita Khrushchev, condemned the "cult of personality" Stalin in his famous "secret speech" in the 20th congress of the Communist Party.
The thaw that followed was short-lived, but for the first time in the Soviet history the possibility of change had been considered -- the possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seizes en1985.
The death of Marshal Tito Josip Broz provoked the reappearance of another kind.
For decades, her reign had imposed a false sense of unity in Yugoslavia.
After his death in 1980, this artificial state began to disintegrate, culminating with the genocidal wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo in the 1990s.
But all the long dictatorship is not complete in disintegration and chaos.
The death of Mao permit the return from exile to Deng Xiaoping under a cloud.
Deng Tim quickly to rout the heirs of the "Gang of Four", and in some years ago, opened the Chinese economy, feeding a capitalist revolution that transformed China more completely, and with more success, the socialist revolution of Mao had never done.
Of course, the Communist party remains in power, and Mao's portrait is still on the Tiananmen Square.
But both are no longer as relics of ideas and ideals that actually have been relegated to the dustbin of history.
Spain also has escaped the dissolution violent when the fascist dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Franco collapsed to his death.
The old dictator can claim credit this success, since by restoring the monarchy of King Juan Carlos just before dying, it gave Spain a foundation upon which to rebuild.
Franco was far to imagine that Juan Carlos was going to build, aided by an intelligent and young bureaucrat at the time Franco appointed Adolfo Suarez, Spain, modern and democratic today.
This is no coincidence that the communist countries were (and still are) generally run by geriatrics, and the democracies of men and women more young people.
This difference is important.
Old leaders can be successfully countries where everything is working quietly, and which do not require further examination of their policies and their targets.
There are exceptions to this rule, of course -- Churchill, Adenauer, Deng, Reagan -- but the États cannot count on the fortune to give them an exceptional leader.
The leaders more young people are more likely to be able to manage the multiple changes in difficult times.
The political competition means that all politicians, whatever their age, to stay alert and to anticipate problems, and to remain open to new ideas.
Nobody can remain well placed to his high office to wait and do nothing that the death or boredom should take.
The systems to a single party, dictatorships playing on the charisma of one man or a mixture of both, as in Yugoslavia of Tito, are a guarantee of Ms minds and inertia of governments.
That will become Cuba after the death of Fidel?
Many observers describe Raúl Castro, the youngest brother of Fidel and his designated successor, as a pragmatist -- the "Castro practice."
When the Soviet largesse have continued in the early 1990s, Raúl has understood that the regime survival depended on economic reforms and has lobbied to allow the private agricultural markets are réouverts to boost production and avoid a possible famine.
However, is the same man who, the head of the internal security apparatus of Cuba, has represented for many years the iron fist of the regime, and who is directly responsible for imprisonment, and often torture, thousands of dissidents.
So perhaps the best that we can hope is an experience to the Russian with a quickly stifled by the old guard nervous of the regime.
In addition, with the support of oil-rich allies such as Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez -- and with the recent discovery of reserves of oil off the coast of Cuba, introducing reforms could well be less urgent.
In this case, Raúl could try to cling firmly in the fossilized system he helped to create and maintain with such brutality.
But Raúl Castro is itself an old man, you can expect a Deng, or better still, Suarez, emerges from the wreckage of the castrisme.
That said, for the moment, the communist Cuba's younger, as secretary of Étrangères Felipe Perez Roque, remain fanatics ideology that many Cubans surnomment "Los Taliban."
If they take the power and keep the finger on the trigger, Cuba could face a new and very long lesson of biology.

The ECB is now an anchor Europe
It is time for the European Central Bank to build a reputation.
Barely a month after the rejection of the constitutional treaty of the European Union in France and Holland, the recent European Union summit in Brussels has ended in a hargneuse orgy of national egoisms, without any agreement is reached on the EU budget.
With Europe in turmoil, the ECB should come as anchors stabilising.
Europe is suffering a serious crisis of confidence that prevents its economic recovery.
Consumers, lacking confidence in the capacity of their political leaders to resolve these problems, save for the bad days that they believe very close, while businessmen are reluctant to invest because they do not trust the government to implement the necessary economic reforms.
As the shows the shameful summit in Brussels, this lack of confidence in the direction of European Union policy is entirely justified.
Instead of acting effectively and constructively on Europe's problems -- the reform of the state systems for expensive medical care for a better overall competitiveness -- the European political leaders are hiding behind false arguments on the "models" Anglo-Saxon ultra-liberals budget rebate, the British and high interest rates, as if the economic weaknesses were due to the mistakes of the ECB.
For undermining the independence of the ECB, European finance ministers are seeking to gain more weight in decisions of the bank.
Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg prime minister and president of Eurogroup, testifying before the council "economic and financial affairs" to the European Union parliament, said that the euro zone finance ministers were to be more forceful in the expression of their positions with the ECB. He has called for talks "open and frank" between the ministers of the Eurogroup and the ECB.
Who needs of these talks?
A common together, the euro zone finance ministers want to talk to lower interest rates, which will help any economic recovery in Europe.
The ECB has already extended the period of stability in Europe with interest rates at the lowest for years.
Can we really believe that consumers refuse to eat -- and that business people putting their investments -- until the next lower interest rates?
To paraphrase Mr Keynes, we cannot do drink a donkey, which has not lust.
"The last thing Europe needs now is a reduction in interest rates," said a member will affect the ECB governing council in a candid assessment of the current situation. Capitulate under external pressure was no good definition of a "stabilising" anchor.
The euro would collapse and the ECB would lose all credibility as the central bank.
The chief economist of the ECB, Otmar Issing, says that long-term interest rates will go back, rather than falling as inflation forecasts are rising.
Thus, reducing interest rates would not only an error, it would be especially madness.
But the ECB will not reduce its rates, although it argues that this would be possible to take the Wolves policies at a distance.
The ECB continues, and it proves to European citizens that there is at least a European institution in which they can trust.
This is extremely important.
History shows that the unrest policies lead to inflation, which in turn feeds more political turmoil.
The Europeans can bet their last euro on the ECB: it won't let his young common currency to wreak havoc on inflation because of political leaders have failed in their task now fear losing their burden.
Indeed, the courage shown by the ECB remaining true to its principles should serve as a model for future European politicians.
When they have understood that we cannot force the bank cuts interest rates, unnecessary and destructive, European leaders will then be the courage to govern, which, after all, is why they were elected.

The dash to the succession of Arafat
To understand what will the Palestinian cause without Yasser Arafat, consider the various securities that it currently holds.
He is president of the executive committee of the PLO, president of the Palestinian National Authority, commander in chief of the Palestinian forces and leader of the Fatah movement.
The PLO embodies the Palestinian national aspirations for independence and the desire to become a state.
It is the body's most high for all Palestinians, both for those living in Palestine that refugees and other Palestinians in the diaspora.
The Arafat's successor will have to juggle between the negotiations with Israel, which will require concessions on the "right of return" of the refugees in Palestine, and the aspirations of more than three million Palestinians who want to return to homes they were expelled during the wars of 1948 and 1967.
The Arafat's successor to the presidency of the Palestinian National Authority will be linked by the Oslo accords, which created an interim government, currently led by Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei, which is responsible for the daily lives of Palestinians living in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
The Palestinians must decide if the president of the PNA will be a strong position or merely symbolic, as is currently the case.
The second option would Qurei a prime minister piloting the wishes of many Palestinians and others.
The position of the commander of Palestinian forces place supposedly various military units, Palestinian security and intelligence in the hands of one leader, who is supposed to uphold the law.
But these forces are now in full of confusion, the majority of Palestinian security organizations in uniform to be reorganized after four years of intensive efforts by Israel to crush them.
The major factor of the internal security lies in the local paramilitary units.
These units, most of which are not controlled by the central direction of the PNA, are more loyal to the leaders of the basis for the PNA officers in uniform.
Local leaders of Fatah as Marwan Barghouti, have a huge power on the army units nationalists who are loosely organized under the title of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.
Barghouti has recommended and tried to implement the elections within Fatah when the Israelis have arrested.
As the leader of street elected to the presidency of university students Bir Zeit, he won his legitimacy by being chosen by his peers.
When the trial of Oslo is open, it has refused to accept any official position in the Palestinian Authority, choosing instead to stay close to senior local Fatah.
Anyone who takes the place of Arafat will ensure that these brigades are convinced that their status, their demands and their leaders are respected.
Indeed, the struggle for power, which will be held in the era post-arafat is centrera ultimately on the Al Fatah, the hub of the PLO.
A World Assembly chooses the revolutionary council of Fatah, which is composed of 100 members and where to turn a central committee of 20 states, in which will focus most of the struggle for power.
Many young street leaders will on an emergency meeting of the Revolutionary Council, or even on the holding of the sixth general assembly (which will be the first since 1988).
The events of recent months show that the Martyrs' Brigades of Al Asqa forced even Arafat to take their demands.
While most of the struggle for power will take place in the camp, however, we must not forget the Islamist camp run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Although it is unlikely that Islamists interfering in the struggle for power post-arafat, they will react if the new leader is in the wrong direction.
Of course, the new leader must reach an agreement with the Islamists on the ground rules, both at home that towards Israel.
Without this agreement and if the new leader is hard against the Islamists, a violent civil war could break out.
More importantly to consolidate its supremacy, the next Palestinian leader will have to take tough decisions and lead to concrete results quickly.
The experience of the first Palestinian prime minister, who resigned in large part due to its inability to make improvements to its people (especially with regard to personal and collective security, respect for law and the end of the mayhem in some Palestinian areas), is still fresh in the memory of the population.
Meanwhile, a freeze of settlement activities, the release of Palestinian political prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, and the elimination of hundreds of checkpoints between the Palestinian cities ranimeraient a sense of hope, without which no Palestinian leader cannot negotiate what the world wants: a peace agreement.
The problem is that no Palestinian leader, whatever it is, cannot make these changes.
They represent a direct challenge to the occupants, the Israeli and Arab countries bordering the international community, led by the United States.

The mystery of 2008 Moscow
Usual at this time, people are obsessed with what is going to give them the new year.
In Russia, the real uncertainty for 2008, 2007.
Indeed, we can reduce today Russian policy to just one topic: President Vladimir Putin will remain in the presidency after 2008, despite its repeated assertions that it will not be?
And if he is giving way, which it will form to succeed it?
The Dolphins, it will be up to one side enemies of the Kremlin?
Or he chooses a foreigner?
À less than Putin retains its position on the ultimate arbiter and decision-making skills the country, there are large risks that a fierce internal fighting is raging.
In an environment where power and ownership are inseparable and all the institutions of government emasculated, a transfer of the supreme authority can lead to a violent redistribution.
Resolving these issues is vital for the political elites Russians anxious to preserve their current benefits and win.
In the public, the vast majority seems resigned to accept any solution arranged by the power.
Some 45% of Russians believe Putin appoints her successor, and that this person will become the new president.
Nearly a quarter believe that the constitution will be amended so that Putin can make a third term.
In one way or another, it is almost universally acknowledged that the transfer of the universal authority is settled at the summit and endorsed by the ballot box.
The balance of forces in the legislature will also be determined by the Kremlin.
In recent years, the configuration of political parties and the law on the elections have been changed several times to adapt to the interests of the ruling elite.
Therefore, unwanted forces have no chance in the parliamentary elections in December.
Étrangers politics, ordinary Russians are indifferent to all who do not affect directly, and trying to call to account for it.
They have not been disturbed by the recent murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya, nor by the assassination of Andrei Kozlov, vice-president of the central bank, or by the implications of the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko (a majority of respondents in a poll said that he had been killed by its "business partners)."
This alienation between the État and the people has a long tradition in Russia, as well as public apathy.
But these days, the apathy is cemented by improving living standards.
Thanks to the oil and gas, the Russians live better than they have never lived to the communist era.
You can argue that history has never seen such a large proportion of Russians have a decent standard of living.
As a result, people have become even more docile with a government increasingly autocratic.
Of course, there are many reasons to complain, and people ronchonnent, but they unite against the status quo.
The marginal groups and individuals who are organising a protest are faced with the official pressure, and even the harassment, which is new reasons for the public their turns its back.
As the election result is played in advance, it may be that many are simply not vote.
In fact, Russia today has almost no reason to bring an active support.
Instead, public participation is seen as an obstacle to the objectives by bureaucracy: its own perpetuation and control ever-widening goods lucrative.
If members of the Russian elite have never harboured ambitions modernisatrices, they have abandoned, because without public participation, the modernisation is an illusion.
À place, the Kremlin relies increasingly on the conservative, Soviet style, as the basis of its power, by the more advanced, entrepreneurs and better trained.
Stephen Jennings, president of the Council of Renaissance Capital, a group of investment which has a decade of experience in Russia, recently noted the "conflicting trends" of the country: the emergence of "middle class booming" next to a "highly centralized government, raising a new class of oligarchs to État and bureaucracy to the rapid growth."
The problem is that the best and brightest elements of Russia, which Jenning praises "big management capabilities, professionalism, productivity and the ambition of social and economic" did not seem to regard as a concern their remoteness of political decision-making.
They may regret the economic policies of the Kremlin, but they cooperate with the rampant corruption in Russia and its ranking shameful in the indices of competitiveness, just as they cooperate to the general erosion of democracy, the manipulation of the judicial system and weak law enforcement.
Just as their fellow countrymen, they do not seek to demand accountability in government or to call for changes.
For now, life is quite beautiful as it is.
Therefore, if the smooth transition of 2008 is threatened, or if there is a risk of destabilisation, will not find that in the conflict at the summit, and not in public.
The optimists hope that one day the Russian middle class is growing, will take responsibility for the future of Russia and will require a radical improvement in how to govern.
But what can trigger the passage of the docility passive public participation active?
If a prosperous leads to the political apathy, and bad policies lead to a decline of socioeconomic status, the Russians the best and brightest could be overtaken by populist forces.

The drugs must change of strategy.
Once again, Russia and Ukraine are victims of an illusion.
Since the end of Communism in 1991, the use of banned drugs has increased dramatically in both countries (and in other).
They have responded by draconian measures in line with the policy simplistic to the total elimination of drugs taken by the UN.
These measures today contribute to the explosion of AIDS in many developing countries.
The UN conventions governing drugs policy at international level do not take account of the recent discovery on the use of drugs and addiction.
Most of these conventions have been established before the appearance of AIDS, which is spread mainly by the use of drugs intraveineuses in the former Soviet countries and in many Asian countries.
Thus, internationally, it is in Russia and Ukraine that AIDS is spreading faster.
The number of people infected has increased by 18 during the past five years.
It is estimated that 1.5 million Russians and 400 000 Ukrainians are affected, and at least 85% of them are drug users intraveineuses.
In a misguided attempt to comply with UN conventions, the Russian and Ukrainian governments use the bulk of their resources to fight against drugs to the repression.
Drug users are victims of abuse from the police and are thrown out by health services, even for care is vital.
And during this time, the drugs continue to flood the market.
In terms of drugs, the crackdown has never managed to eliminate the request.
The repression takes into account or the social and economic factors, nor the public health issues related to the use of banned substances.
Locking up the drug users is not a solution; in Russia, it is even easier to buy drugs in prison outside it.
In a climate of repression, drug users who escape the arrest tend to be subject to discrimination, which does not encourage them to protect their health or the people they contact.
If the company offers no hope for addicts and showed no compassion towards them, drug addiction and the AIDS virus can develop quickly.
Russia and Ukraine are not only to deal with the increase of intravenous drug use and the spread of AIDS.
If they continue this type of policy, Pakistan, Iran, China, the Central Asian countries and all the countries who are in the same situation will face the same disaster in terms of public health.
Many work around the world show that in the fight against drugs, the action in the area of public health is the most effective way to reduce HIV infection and reduce costs.
The British medical journal Lancet estimated that the US might have saved at least $500 million if they had set up an exchange programme of needles at national level during the period 1987-1995.
A survey conducted at international level indicates that HIV infections fell by 5.8% in the cities where there is an exchange programme of needles, but it has increased 5.9% in the cities where there is not.
A study of importance is highlights a correlation between the existence of an exchange programme of needles and an increase of drug addiction.
Studies in the USA, Australia and elsewhere show that if the number of drug addicts who benefit from treatment is not falling, it is because the participants of the needle exchange programmes have easier access.
The UN agencies such as the Commission on drugs or the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (onudc, ex-pnucid) have no mandate to prescribe a strategy to fight against drugs.
However, their narrow vision of the fight against drugs has a strong influence on policy and measures that make the etats-membres.
Many governments, obsessed with respect to the UN conventions, are unable or unwilling to take account of the negative effects in terms of public health policy strictly repressive fight against drugs.
In the 1990s, when AIDS has started to kill millions of people in Africa, contaminating more of a quarter of the population of some countries, the international institutions have hijacked the head.
For reasons similar to this terrible disease is preparing to strike, among other countries of the Soviet Union.
Have we learned nothing?
It is not too late, policymakers at the national and international levels can still reconsider their strategy.
Despite the UN conventions, some countries have adopted a more pragmatic approach to drugs and AIDS.
Consider that this is primarily a public health problem can combat much more effectively the AIDS epidemic.
The following measures to prevent this.
· an anti-discrimination law to ensure the civil liberties and human rights drug users and people affected by HIV.
· acknowledge that the use of drugs is a public health problem and not law enforcement or law enforcement and implement a policy that reflects this.
· make explicit the needle exchange programmes and the treatment of methadone and other alternatives.
· seeking national programmes to reduce the risks which are pragmatic and accessible to all. It is through education, alternative therapies, "and the exchange of needles.
· both nationally and internationally, involve drug users and their supporters to the development of policy on drugs.
Refuse to reconsider the goals of the fight against drugs and the strategies selected will only worsen the AIDS epidemic and contribute to the death of millions of vulnerable people.

The abandonment of Lisbon resolutions.
Since his inauguration as president of the European Commission, Durao - former prime minister of Portugal - will have to devote urgently to restore order and to refocus the economic policies of the European Union.
The issue the thickest who is one of the resolutions of Lisbon, an ambitious programme approved in 2000 by the heads of État and European Union government in order to the Union "the most competitive economy and dynamic" from 2010.
The main economic fields are covered: innovation and entrepreneurship, the reform of social systems, and social inclusion, skills and employment, gender equality at work, the liberalisation of labour markets and goods and sustainable development.
It is certain that these are valeureuses ambitions but which are part of the sphere of domestic political decisions.
Indeed, according to EU treaties, the union has no authority to implement an arsenal of legislative and policy in these areas, nor the power to enforce.
However, the Council of Europe, encouraged by the European Commission, has invented a new political approach - called "open coordination" - to be able to affect these areas.
The open coordination involves the determination of common aims at EU level, a voluntary compliance from the États states and internal control results in the Council of Europe.
Évidemment open coordination has failed to keep its promises.
The illusion that the Council of Europe can somehow Sommer growth and productivity has provided a distraction to the national politicians who do not want to promotion at national level of unpopular decisions.
So, I suggest Mr Barroso, at first, get rid of Lisbon resolutions.
This is the only thing to do to make clear that national responsibilities remain in the hands of national politicians on economic performance.
This leads me to macro-economic coordination at EU level.
The Maastricht Treaty was considering a policy framework simplified for economic and monetary union.
The monetary policy was centralised and entrusted to an independent central bank, while the tax policy remains the responsibility of the États states.
The national governments were subject to the dual constraint, according to the excessive deficit procedure - aimed at preventing fiscal deficits of more than 3% of GDP and budget deficits of more than 60% of GDP (or at least around this value).
Subsequently, the stability and growth added an additional criterion, in the medium term for the national budgets are almost "balanced".
It was, essentially, to prevent the reckless fiscal policies after the launch of the euro, while leaving enough space to cyclical swings deficits in the limit of 3%.
The credibility of this package of measures was badly damaged by the public controversy in November 2003 between the Commission and the Ecofin Council on the application of the procedure for control of excessive budget deficits in France and Germany.
What does not mean that it must be abandoned.
Instead, a common external constraints on the behaviour of stimulus is necessary to safeguard together against a build-up of public debt not viable, which could affect financial stability and inflation across the European Union - an increased risk by the impact of ageing populations on pension systems.
Such a constraint also offers an anchor for the national decision-making in the États states whose political systems are less strengthened.
But the system must be reviewed.
I do not listen to those who defend the exclusion of investments in fiscal deficits: it would provide only a new incentive for the creative accounting and an accumulation unsustainable debts.
Instead, the emphasis is on the viability of debt rather than on the annual deficits.
The criterion of debt, for example, could be accompanied by a restriction on (the) growth rate of public spending, which would be kept below the rate of nominal GDP.
The power of the Commission to launch the Movement when there is risk of excessive deficit should be strengthened – unless, of course, the commission never forgets that the monitoring of national policies is a task that requires a certain political sense and cannot be left in the hands of managers and lawyers.
Finally, it must be of European integration, the main priority for the union has at its disposal a powerful legal instrument to force open markets and increase competition.
The best therapy for reviving growth must be both direct, the increased competitive pressure, and indirectly, by the outbreak of the measures necessary to adapt the national employment policies of social welfare and education.
This is a long haul.
The subsidies to État to benefit the companies losing remain ambiguous and common laws designed to ensure the free movement of goods and services are not fully respected by the États states - the public markets and energy are the best examples.
Moreover, most of the service markets – trade securities, the distribution of wholesale and retail, services to businesses and local public services - remain protected from competition and regulation of free trade.
The evidence is there to show that these market distortions of services, which represents two-thirds of GDP are responsible for most of the lack of productivity that is the EU États-unis.
In recent years, the Council of Europe has not been paying attention to these tasks, involving a total commitment and swelling of the États states to implement and implement the EU directives.
Too often, the commission has promoted the introduction of new legislation and the creation of new spending programmes, rather than the management of what is already in place.
So, Mr Barroso should forget the platitudes of top flight of the Lisbon resolutions and concentrate instead on the implementation of the single market and put in the fiscal policies of États states.
It must allow local governments to take responsibility for the economic performance of their country.

The clash of civilizations emotional
Throughout the so-called "war against terrorism," the notion of "clash of civilisations" between Islam and the West has generally been excluded as politically incorrect and intellectually obtuse.
The most common interpretation of the place is that the world has entered a new era of a conflict "inside" of a civilization, namely Islam, with the Muslim fundamentalists in war against the moderates against the West.
The conclusion of strategic derived from this analysis was clear, ambitious and easily summed up: democratization.
If the lack of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem, bring democracy to the 'great' East would be the solution, and it was the historic duty of États-unis, as the most powerful nation and moral, make this change is necessary.
The status quo was untenable.
Get the democracy in place, with or without a change of regime, was the only alternative to the chaos and the rise of fundamentalism.
Iraq is perhaps the edge of the civil war between Sunnis and Shia.
Iran, ruled by a new and more radical, irresistibly, is heading towards achieving a nuclear capability.
A free election procedure brought Hamas in power in Palestine, and the unfortunate episode of drawings humoristiques Danish newspapers has illustrated the nature almost fuel of relations between Islam and the West.
All these developments are open to new interpretations.
Rather than a "clash of civilizations," we could be facing many levels of conflict, which interact them so that they increase the global instability.
Indeed, it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict.
There is a division within Islam, which, if the violence in Iraq is spreading to neighbouring countries, is likely to cause a regional destabilization.
There is also a clash that should not be regarded as between Islam and the West, but between the secular and religious people growing.
À a deeper and more resurfacing, there is an emotional conflict between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation.
It would be a gross simplification, as some do, a clash between civilization and barbarity.
In reality, we are facing a gap is widening the role of religion, and which stretches between the West (with the États-unis in the role of the complex) and most of the world (except the most noteworthy is China), particularly the Islamic world.
The gap reflects how religion defines an individual's identity within a society.
À a time where religion is becoming increasingly important we Europeans have largely forgotten our past religious (violent and intolerant), and have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in the daily lives of others.
In certain aspects, "they" are our own past life and, in a combination of ignorance, prejudice and above all else, fear, we are afraid that "they" can define our future.
We live in a secular world, where freedom of expression can easily turn into mockery insensitive and irresponsible, while others see religion as their ultimate purpose, if not their last hope.
They have tried everything, nationalism to regionalism, communism and capitalism.
Since it has failed, why not try God?
Globalisation may not have created these levels of conflict, but it has increased by making the most visible and more palpable.
À our globalised era, we have lost the privilege, and paradoxically, the virtue of ignorance.
We all see how others perceive and react, but without the historical and cultural foundation needed to decipher these responses.
Globalisation has made the bed of a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions and ignorance.
This emotional shock is exacerbated in the case of Islam.
In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of the humiliation suffered by the peoples and nations who regard themselves as the main losers, the worst victims of an international system new and unfair.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is exemplary.
It has become an obsession.
This is not that Arabs and Muslims are really worried about the Palestinians.
Instead, the Islamic world has left the Palestinian without real support for decades.
In reality, for them in the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of a colonial unfair, to represent their political unrest, and to embody the fact that they perceive to be masters of their fate.
In the eyes of the Arabs (and some other Muslims), the strength and resilience of Israel is a direct consequence of their own weakness, their divisions and corruption.
The majority of Arabs may not support al-Qaida, but there are not opposed to their hearts.
À place, the temptation is to treat Osama bin Laden as a kind of Robin Hood, which acts, officially unforgivable, have helped to restore a sense of pride and dignity of the Arabs.
This is, perhaps, that is the true clash of civilizations: in the emotional conflict between the culture of fear and Muslim culture of humiliation, and particularly in Arabic.
It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of such a wide gap emotional, and acknowledged its existence is the first step to overcome.
But it will be difficult, because transcend the emotional clash of civilisations requires an opening to the "other" that none of the two sides is perhaps ready to consider.

Globalisation and anti-Americanism
Anti-American feelings are everywhere.
The American Democrats argue that the policies of President Bush have damaged the attractiveness of America.
Republicans respond that America is doomed to be unloved because of its size and its association with globalisation.
According to them, anti-Americanism will persist because some view America as a threat of culture.
Personally, I think that these positions are historical perspectives.
Unlike the conventional wisdom, globalisation is not a factor of standardization and Americanization of world cultures.
Although the United States are the first lines of the information revolution, to develop the similarities of cultural and social behaviours (such as listening to the television or the use of the Internet) which are attributed to the Americanization, even if the correlation is not the causal relationship.
To understand why, imagine a country that would introduce technology and communication with speed in a world where America would not exist.
One would expect to be changes to social and cultural importance of such a modernisation.
Of course, because of the existence of the United States and their presence in the vanguard of the revolution, there is a degree of Americanization, which will probably during the 21st century thanks to the technological penetration and the modernisation of local cultures in their own pace.
The historical evidence that globalization is not necessarily uniformity is in Japan, which has deliberately isolated from the world during the first wave of globalisation.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, Japan became the first Asian country to host the world and to go with success in the world without losing its uniqueness.
At the Meiji Restoration, Japan has tried all the tools and innovations that will enable it to become a leading power rather than a victim of Western imperialism.
It was to submit his youth study in Western societies.
Its delegations have been shown around the world in search of scientific, technological and industrial innovations.
In the political field, reformers Japan were very aware of the philosophy and American institutions, but they chose to turn to the German model that they found more appropriate to a country ruled by an emperor.
The lesson that Japan is the world does not just the fact that an Asian country can be competitive, but only after a century and a half of globalisation, it remains possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture.
The image of an America as a factor homogenisation reflects wrongly a vision of cultures.
Efforts to show local cultures as immutable often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than a description of reality.
As the Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa, those who defend the cultural identities against globalisation betray a inhibée attitude towards culture seen outside of any historical dimension.
We know of a culture that would have remained unchanged throughout the time?
To find these cultures, it must go to the meeting of small communities, magico-religieuses primitive, populated by people who... the fact of their primitive, are increasingly vulnerable to exploitation and extermination.
The culture we are constantly transition, along with other cultures without these loans are still being made to the United States.
Thus, a large number of countries have come to Canada, rather than the US as an example for their own constitution in the years following the end of the Cold War.
Globalisation is also a double-edged sword.
In some areas, not only the backlash is against the American cultural imports, but some efforts are made to change American culture itself.
A majority of Americans are probably agree with the death penalty nowadays, but the death penalty is seen as a blatant violation of human rights across Europe, in fact almost everywhere in the world.
The American positions on the environment and climate change or GMOs raise the same criticism.
More subtly, the opening of America with immigration enriches as well as it turns American culture.
Finally, globalisation and the information revolution could strengthen rather than reduce the cultural diversity.
Some commentators French expressing their fears about the world of global marketing of the Internet with no place to a culture attached to hundreds of varieties of cheese.
Instead, the internet enables consumers dispersed to assemble in a way to encourage niche markets, and even the hundreds of websites devoted exclusively to the cheese.
The Internet also allows people to establish a package of political communities more diverse.
The use of Welsh in Britain or the Gaelic in Ireland is more important today than it was half a century ago.
Britain, Belgium and Spain, among other European countries have given greater powers to regions and local elected officials.
The information age of the world could well strengthen rather than weaken local cultures.
The global economic and social product superficial similarities in the logos of T-shirt or trademarks of drinks, but there will always be a great cultural diversity behind it.
The American culture dominates the world today, and it contributes to the attractiveness of America, this is its soft power, in many areas, but not in all areas.
Meanwhile, immigrants, the ideas and events outside the US border change American culture within the borders of the United States.
While globalization has the technological capabilities, information technology we allow a wider participation in the communications and global domination of the economy and culture in America could well be watered down.
Less dominance could well mean a little less anxiety about the Americanization, least of protests against American arrogance and a lesser intensity in the aftermath of anti-Americanism.
The United States may have less control in the future, but could find themselves living in a world more compatible with its basic principles of democracy, free enterprise, of individual freedoms and human rights.

Why America should join the World
The terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 on New York and Washington have changed the United States by shifting the priorities on foreign policy.
The new national security strategy the Bush administration, drawn up in September 2002, identifies the combination of terrorism and rogue states and weapons of mass destruction as the first threat to America.
Most people agree with the new direction taken by American foreign policy, but are contesting the method used.
The threat is so large that America should be acting alone or the US should act only with the support of international institutions, even if it stifles the country?
The events in Iraq illustrate this debate, but it takes its inspiration from something deeper.
During his presidential campaign in 2000, George W. Bush said of America: "If we are an arrogant nation, they will as well, but if we are a nation humble, they will."
It was right, but unfortunately too many friends in America have seen his administration during the first eight months after his election, is concerned with limited interests of America, focused on military power and disregarding the treaties, standards and multilateralism.
The announcement and the administration declaring that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change was "dead" has led to a reaction from other countries which has cost the United States headquarters to the Commission on Human Rights.
The September 11, allegedly has changed all that.
Congress has finally paid off debts owed by America to the UN and the president has focused its efforts on the formation of a coalition against terrorism.
But the success of the war in Afghanistan has led some members of the administration and some commentators to conclude the functioning of unilateralism. The columnist Charles Krauthammer, for example, recommends a "new unilateralism" in which America is refusing to play the role of "citizen" international meek and continues with its own targets.
The new unilateralism is a mistake by focusing too heavily on military power alone.
It is true that military power of America, supported by a budget in the same combination of the eight most powerful country after the United States, is essential to global stability and plays a major role in response to terrorism.
But the metaphor of the war should not be naive about the fact that the removal of terrorism will take years of civil cooperation patient not spectacular with other countries in areas such as the sharing of information, the police work, the traceability of financial flows and cooperation between the customs.
The military success in Afghanistan has resolved the most simple problem.
Al Qaeda retains the cells in 15 countries.
Rather than to prove the point of view of unilateralism, the partial success in Afghanistan is the continuing need for cooperation.
It was much easier to win the war in Iraq that winning the peace.
The problem for Americans of the 21st century is more important than ever of problems and forces beyond the control of the most powerful state. The attacks of September 11 demonstrated that the revolution and the globalisation of information has changed the world policy so that the Americans cannot meet all their international goals, acting alone.
The United States lack of international and national preconditions necessary to resolve conflicts in other companies and to monitor and control the cross-border transactions that threaten the Americans in their country.
In several major problems, such as the global financial stability, smuggling of drugs, the spread of disease or climate change, the military power is ineffective.
Indeed, his appeal may prove counterproductive.
America must instead use the international coalition to deal with these threats and these common challenges.
The spirit of cooperation from other countries depends in part of their own personal interest, but also the attractiveness of the American positions.
This soft power is what I call the "soft power."
This means that other countries want what you want and that the need to use the carrot and stick to persuade others to do what you want is less now.
The hard power derives from the military and economic power of a country.
The soft power is the product of the attraction is represented by the culture, the ideals and the policies of a country.
The hard power will always be essential, but the soft power will become increasingly important in the treatment of problems that the resolution requires multilateral cooperation.
It is certain that no major countries cannot afford to be strictly multilateralist, and the US must sometimes take the lead in other countries, as happened in Afghanistan.
But in Iraq, President Bush should have followed the example of his father and represent a broad international coalition.
Now, while his administration back to the UN to seek a new resolution that will allow other countries to provide troops and resources to maintain peace and reconstruction in Iraq, it pays the price of its method of entry into war.
Yes, multilateralism can be used by the smaller states to restrict freedom of action in America, but it does not mean that it would not act, in general, in the interests of America.
In the US policies in the Multilateral structures, the US can make their disproportionate power more legitimate and more acceptable.
Even the Americans have good intentions are not immune to the famous warning of Lord Acton's phrase, which says that the power tends to be corrupt.
Learn to listen to others and to define the American interests more broadly to include the global interests will be crucial to the American soft power, and the vision that will have the rest of their dominant (something healthy or not).
The paradox of American power is that the power the most important since Rome cannot reach a large number of its objectives unilaterally in the information age.
America must pay more attention to be flexible and multilateral cooperation.
This is the real lesson on 11 September.

Socialism or division?
For the first time in our history, we have the knowledge, technology and wealth needed for the design of a different world.
We have the means to "send poverty in the dustbin of history" (Make Poverty History).
Although we have the power to change the world, we do not take appropriate action.
In 2000, many governments around the world have adopted under the UN Millennium Development Goals aimed at halving poverty by 2015.
The international community does not, however, the political will to respond to these basic responsibility to humanity, leading to a loss of confidence in the policy in the people.
If we do not act, our people will lose hope in the power of democracy and wallow in extremism, fundamentalism and violence.
In order to restore the confidence of people not only in policy but also in their own potential, our policies must ensure a responsible government and institutions operating responsibly in the interest of citizens.
The Socialist International, the largest political organization in the world, can they join the citizens of the world around a new world programme designed to achieve these goals.
Our first challenge will be the democratisation of globalisation.
We must redefine the globalisation since the base and include two thirds of humanity that are currently excluded from the process, in terms that reflect the socialist principles of the inclusion of cultural diversity and sustainable development.
How can we get the citizens of a democratic way to economic development when the IMF and World Bank work under the principle of "a dollar, a voice"?
Democracy cannot thrive in a world where the capital and power are heavily concentrated in the hands of some, when the multinationals questioned the power of democratically elected representatives, when organized crime can afford to buy the police, justice and politicians, when the domination of the media is eroding fundamental freedoms.
The democratization of globalisation will take time.
However, we can speed the process by strengthening regional cooperation and integration.
It calls for the creation of new channels of cooperation with the progressive forces in other parts of the world, China, the États-unis, India and the Arab world.
In response to global problems, we must strengthen and democratize the international institutions, including the United Nations.
However, we must go beyond the reform of the Security Council and begin to create a global architecture Democratic for globalisation to serve the people and not the markets.
Today, the main priority of the Socialists is to restore the balance between economic productivity and social justice.
While we have previous successful, especially the Nordic model, it remains difficult to achieve this balance in some countries.
The capitalist markets caving to large commercial networks and the market economies turned into companies, governments and the unions are still more restricted in their freedom of action.
That has paralysed and divided our fellow citizens.
The citizens of the developed countries always feels more objectivé by consumerism and the citizens of developing countries are fighting daily to survive.
In both cases, but in different ways, people feel poorer.
It is certain that we belong to different companies, but we must also deal with new forms of inequality.
The lack of labour standards in some parts of the world undermines the social welfare workers from other parts of the world.
The migration of masses of poor countries has fuelled feelings of fear and xenophobia in rich countries, particularly in the working class.
Similarly, free trade has sent back to back the farmers and employees of the service sector of the developed and developing countries.
The environmental issues have become a great blame game.
The developed countries fear the despoiling of vital resources if they are shared with developing countries, which in turn accusing rich countries to destroy the environment in their quest for profit.
To fill these divisions, we need to rethink the nature of jobs in the world economy still more automated, décloisonnée and mobile.
Capital is global, core Labour standards must also be globalise.
The forced and child labour, as well as discrimination in hiring, must be removed.
We must also democratizing our own policies.
We must fight against exclusion in our political parties as we are fighting the exclusion in our societies.
This means of welcoming immigrants and minorities, to create greater opportunities for women and the disabled, empowering the people through education and participation.
Empowering the people will give them the power to decide and the ability to decide.
At the Greek socialist party PASOK, which I lead, we have undertaken far-reaching reforms in this direction.
It is even within the Socialist International, which seeks to create a world governed by free markets, but by the free people.

The Chinese and Indian hare tortoise
"India is everywhere: this was the subject of world economic forum this year.
In the western world, a great importance is attached to the achievements of China, so that those of India will come to mind that afterwards.
To underline the fact that political stability to triumph on the long term, Indians have covered all the bus to the Swiss flag "India, democracy is emerging, the fastest in the world."
The Indian media blitz was a monumental success.
À Davos, all the speakers have included the idea that even if China is currently the rope in the long term, the race between the two Asian giants will play to pile or face.
At least for a few days, the emergence of India as a superpower, compared to China, was a fait accompli.
But what is really the race between the two economies that relate to each over a billion people?
Apparently, China has a comfortable lead over India.
Twenty-five years ago, at the dawn of the movement of globalisation, national production in India and China were roughly the same.
Now, whatever the economic indicators, China is twice as rich as India.
But the real difference is not so that the best Chinese perform better than the best Indians.
The elite Indian is made up of Champions. The bold bid of $22 billion proposed by Lakshmi Mittal to redeem the French aciériste Arcelor, the shows.
The real difference -- that we admit it or not -- is the fact that the Chinese Communist government has managed to globalize a larger portion of the population that the democratic government of India has failed to do so.
However, it is impossible to say that wealth to be evenly distributed in China.
It is only along the coast, with roughly a third of the Chinese people, that people seem to really be returned in the 21st century.
The bulk of rural China is still very poor and 150 million rural Chinese do not have jobs. In the countryside, health and education are reminiscent of the past centuries.
However, the figures of the exclusion from the caste system, are even worse in India.
It may be that only one in five will take the globalised economy.
For an employee in the call centers, there are countless Indians, who are only just stumble along.
While some 450 million Chinese are participating in the global economy, only 200 to 250 million Indians benefit.
More than anything else, this is the difference between the two economies.
That can make India to fill this gap?
His biggest flaw is the lack of roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure. À this level, the contrast with China is striking.
If the Indian products can only access to the global market, how India could win it?
Over the past five years, China has multiplied by five of its road infrastructure.
Its new 50,000 miles of roads were built to accommodate larger aircraft, which is incompatible with certain lines of atterissage Indian airports.
This is not just a matter of money: the cash flows across the Indian central bank has mainly invested in Treasury bonds with low yields.
The real problem is that the Chinese authoritarian system has no real opposition when he decides to ground a shantytown on the road to a new airport.
The Indian government, however, has neither power nor the will of walking on the poor people to enrich more rich.
Unfortunately, without infrastructure, the 800 million Indians who have not yet succeeded in life have little chance.
India will never create enough jobs in the services sector, it must be able to become competitive in the manufacturing of products low priced.
Without a better network infrastructure, the majority of Indians will remain out of globalisation.
Thus, the Indian economy could one day succeed to the Chinese hopeless romantic?
Not necessarily. The areas in which India excels, essentially, offer potentially higher margins that industrial production.
On this point, the Chinese, crippled by a legal system largely below, will struggle to compete.
Western companies are more confidence in the Indian companies in terms of sensitive financial data or patents, as they do to China.
The foreign companies know that, if they outsourcing their methods of high technology in China, they can also publish their projects on the Web.
India also has a financial system much more developed than China, asset of increasing importance as the two economies are changing.
The command and control of finance (loans run, such as economists call) are effective when it comes to build bridges. They are much less when we have to choose companies deserve to be saved.
The challenge for the Indians and for other emerging economies (Brazil, Russia and Mexico) is to find new ways to increase their economic sectors that are going without the strangle.
If India managed to catch up with China, it should include a greater number of its citizens in the world by offering better education, health care facilities more efficient and network infrastructure.
This is only at that price that India will be everywhere. "

The G8 countries of the black gold
Poor Russia, rich in oil.
It is so hard to find its place in the elite Group of Eight countries taken seriously.
President Vladimir Putin, who hope may raise the presidential debate at the summit in St Petersburg in July, has mijoté an ambitious programme.
It plans to engage his colleagues in conversations érudites on education, infectious diseases, and to be sure that nobody is endorme, the "energy security."
And that Putin's efforts to valent-ils?
Not much.
The Bush administration, represented by Vice-President Dick Cheney (but with the approval of the boss) recently accused Russia of reverting to its old manies "evil empire."
Putin hit back with the États-unis "Comrade Wolf" ready to melt on any nation showing signs of weakness.
How Bush and Putin will be welcome at the meeting in St. Petersburg? the suspense remains.
The European, are still on the brink of nerves, so great is their fear of becoming once again caught the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which has drained their pipelines for several days earlier this year.
For them, talk of "energy security" with Russia is to go into the water security with comrade crocodile.
Évidemment if we want to be bad we can always point out the absurdity of membership for Russia to a club which includes the giants of the États-unis economies, Germany, Japan, England, France, Italy and (a) of Canada.
Why the Chinese President Hu Jintao, whose country has the second largest economy (measured according to global prices), he was not given the place of Putin around the table?
After all, even with all its energy resources, and despite the current surge in gas and oil prices, the national product of Russia is little more than that of greater Los Angeles.
Perhaps he should stop to collect all the criticism and go on the offensive.
It could begin by pointing out to his Democratic counterparts if enough that it is probably more popular in Russia that none of them in his own country.
In fact, it could probably win honestly an election tomorrow (not to risk that he knows a day that said).
There are few leaders who could without laughing.
Évidemment, the success of Putin in recent years to eliminate anything approaching a free press (and when a former KGB "eliminate" the Free Press is not that a style) has contributed to silence any open opposition.
That does not, however, Putin to enjoy a real popularity among a public who demand a leader able to attach the country without the sink.
Putin may also argue that the fiscal position of his country is far more solid than the other G8 members.
The fact that Siberia has proved to be a giant oil wells, which the government absorbs most of the income has been very helpful.
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is also going to balance the books of his country, for now.
But to be honest, oil is not all.
Most economists recommend the rich countries to replace their old codes complicated tax by a simple and low, to a flat rate, and bemoan the fact that so few countries have tried.
Putin has put in place this style of politics a few years, and the results have all of the miracle.
Of course, it is possible as the other G8 leaders are less enchanted by some Russian practices in the area of the resolution of budget problems.
Most of the G8 countries seem unable to achieve the political consensus needed to take the necessary measures, such as increasing the retirement age or the significant reduction of indexing benefits on inflation.
Russia has virtually abandoned its pensioners having increased the amount of their income.
In fact, many elderly Russians are forced to ensure their survival to grow potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to grow.
It is, if they survive: since the fall of the Berlin Wall, male life expectancy fell 65 years ago to about 60 years.
It seems that the stress of the transition is the leading cause of death, even before the big killers of post-communist Russia as alcohol, crime and AIDS.
Putin should say to his colleagues that they too could balance the intergenerational account of their country in affamant older?
In fact, Putin would likely be well advised not to overstate the achievements of his country.
Perhaps it is best left vodka sink afloat and hope of cute smiles on the family photo.
Nevertheless, when Putin announces to his guests that they have to pay for Russia to increase their own "energy security," he will perhaps eventually get the respect that it is so strong.
The Économie fear
The world economy seems to walk on water, brushing aside to shrug their shoulders of rising oil prices, the political paralysis in Europe, the unsustainable deficit of États-unis and record prices of real estate.
Just because, as would have us believe the G8 leaders, investors are optimistic, confident in the direction in the world economy by their leaders?
Or are governed by a disease of fear, fed by certain events, such as the recent terrorist attacks in London, which maintains the long-term interest rates low, masking as a whole set of problems latent?
The role of long-term interest rates, extremely low (after adjustment for inflation), who hides a multitude of weaknesses in the world economy, is all too apparent.
The rise in property prices across the world supports the call in many countries, and, according to a recent study of the International Monetary Fund, interest rates falling continues to explain the two-thirds or more of the rise of international prices.
Europe has less benefit, but its savings would have a worse if long-term interest rates were back to their average of 25 years ago.
Similarly, Latin America is experiencing a boom in recent years, despite the burden of debt and a political reform mixed.
The weak long-term interest rates have led to the region to manage its debt, while demand has helped drive the price of exports of commodities in the region.
Why the soaring oil prices did not put to its knees following the global economy, as was so often the case in the past?
Once again, the answer lies in the low interest rates.
Usually, a sudden surge in oil prices translates as soon as expectations of high inflation, followed by the rise in interest rates for all the dates.
But this time the Fed continues to push its short-term lending rates to control inflation and long-term interest rates that are far more important, have declined, as if by magic.
Indeed, America is the single biggest beneficiary of this cycle of low interest rates, where everyone borrows money as if soon there would be nowhere.
Property owners, supported by rising housing prices, mounting debts.
The federal government has laid out the window any fiscal prudence.
The whole country absorbs so incredible three-quarters of global savings.
But, as long as interest rates remain low and high growth, the Americans can laugh in the faces of those who pronostiquent their excess plant the fruits of their downfall.
But if low long-term interest rates help both economies to walk on water, why the rates are so low and it will continue?
The situation is perhaps more fragile than many politicians would have us believe.
People feel less, not more secure about their long-term future, either because they fear terrorism, a global pandemic or a set of financial crises.
I do not say that investors are hysterical, but simply that they have become a little more concerned about the long-term prospects.
Therefore, they are thrown on the actions and mortgage securities they receive, rightly or wrongly, as safe.
We have no other explanation.
It is certain that emerging markets are in a savings unusual, reformant their reserves and improving their balance the budget, but nobody expects that to continue indefinitely.
Even the director of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, the Oracle of Delphi bore on interest rates, says about the current situation that it is a "mystery".
History suggests that the technology boom has not completely finished playing its role, and with the productivity gains Americans prepared to irradiating the world, making up the rate of growth everywhere.
Usually, a rapid global growth is reflected in interest rates to rise for the long term, unless, of course at the bottom of themselves, people have become concerned.
Suppose that investors are mindful of the possibilities of disaster in the five to ten years.
(According to experts nuclear terrorism and pandemics, the risk is real.)
Suppose that investors believe that growth will probably remain strong, but maybe -- just maybe -- the situation is then.
In this case, it setpoint quite possible to coexist with low interest rates with strong growth.
It is true that some economists have happy days of the 1950s and early 1960s, when Europe, the États-unis and Japan flourished, but interest rates were generally well below the rate of economic growth.
This time representing the golden age of global growth, why worry if we are experiencing the same phenomenon today?
What the optimists forget is that these years of Paradise were also a period of great uncertainty.
Many were those who feared the outbreak of World War III, and rightly so, according to many historians.
At that time, the specter of the book helped keep the loans at affordable rates.
Fortunately, the worst fears of investors have not made, and we can only hope today the same thing.
But if uncertainty is one of the main reasons for which interest rates are low, then the G8 leaders should be less quick to congratulate themselves.
The fragility of the psychology of the collective investors is known.
If they are moderating a day, interest rates will rise and that could lead to ferment the imbalances latent in the world economy.

Political upheaval in Israel.
The political world of Israel is going through the changes the more impressive than it has seen for 30 years ago.
The realignment of parties and leaders is particularly notable, given the unexpected nature of recent events to date: Ariel Sharon's decision to leave the Likud, the defeat of Shimon Peres as head of the Labour Party and the withdrawal of Labour members of the grand coalition government of Sharon.
It is more important to understand the significance of these changes for the future of Israel, the region, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Basically, the Israeli political system is approaching the end of its second era.
The independence in 1948 until 1977, the Labour Party has dominated, before giving way to a coalition of opposition composed of conservative, nationalist and centrist parties allies in the bloc of Likud.
Since then, the two parties have alternated in power in turn, sometimes in the grand coalitions and sometimes in partnership with smaller parties.
On the surface, the rivalry between the parties matches between "left" and "right," or "hawks" and "doves."
The truth, of course, is more complex.
The social classes and the economic problems in the shadow of existential more persistent concerns, such as physical safety, and the continuity of État, played a role much less important in Israel than in other societies.
Here, the political divide could define itself as the clash of "optimistic" and "pessimistic".
The first, Labour, believed that one day a force would be among Arabs and Palestinians ready to make peace on reasonable grounds, while the latter, Likud, were more circumspect.
For years, the discussion has been an abstraction, a debate on what could happen in the future, until the Oslo accords with the PLO in 1993 to test the opposing views.
Since 2000, when the PLO leader Yasser Arafat rejected a political agreement and has begun to place a terrorist war five years, there is little optimistic.
The realignment of intellectual which resulted in Israel has given birth to a new national consensus.
It is now widely accepted that, as has always stressed the left, Israel must be ready to withdraw from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and accept the existence of a Palestinian État in exchange for real peace.
But it is also widely accepted that, as the right has always supported any of the partners is really ready to make peace.
In this context, Sharon has won two landslide election victories as a radical applying a moderate policy, including a total withdrawal of the Gaza Strip.
That is where Israel today, a political changes fueled by two new elements.
First, Sharon has moved the Likud in the centre, and has made the hegemonic party, while destroying all the stereotypes on his personality, its methods and his vision of the world.
It is for the same reason that many members of the Likud party see Sharon, who has helped to found the party, as a traitor.
Sharon must now be institutionalized his reforms, even if he needs another party.
Secondly, the Labour Party has proved its bankruptcy, since his only option was a leader Shimon Peres aged 82 years, and that his anachronistic optimism of Dove was ridiculed.
Accordingly, and thanks to a low voter turnout, the selection of the party have been won by Amir Peretz, outsider and populist who wants to revive the Labour Party in highlighting the social and economic problems, which means the withdrawal of the coalition of national unity with Likud.
Although it should form a new party, Sharon wins the next election, he has scheduled for February.
The strategy of Peretz perhaps voters will attract other left-wing parties, but Labour will surely lose centrist voters (and those for which the national security is a priority) for the benefit of Sharon.
Paradoxically, it will take a huge in principle, and perhaps very modest in practice.
When Sharon has a strong public support to exert moderate politics, Israel will be more prepared than ever to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, Syria, and the Arab world in general to find a diplomatic solution global conflict.
However, given the chaos and the paralysis that characterise increasingly Palestinian politics, this opportunity will not be seized.
The growing power of Hamas, who says openly its strategy to increase the acts of terrorism and destroy Israel, only to strengthen this trend.
You can say the same of Syria, whose government sweeping turns to a militant dangerously risky.
Sharon could decide the partial withdrawal and the rings of West Bank settlements.
But it is today widely acknowledged that such changes are a reaction to bleak prospects for real progress toward peace.
Hang on to land to the challenges of a bargaining has much less sense if there is no one with whom to tout.
Israel will continue to priority handling its own security, strengthening its defences against terrorism and consolidating its control over the relatively small portions of the West Bank that it intends to claim as part of a possible diplomatic agreement.
Secondary consequence of this strategy, coupled with Palestinian attacks, international sympathy has been growing towards Israel.
This phenomenon could persist if the current political realignment that has occurred, enabling Sharon to win its programme of the centre and even the moderate left.
Nothing is assured, of course.
Benjamin Netanyahu, who remains popular, may well become a powerful rival to his right, and Peretz may well make the Labour party a strong contender to his left.
Nevertheless, the national consensus has changed, in undermining any convictions on the Israeli policies.
The February elections will submit those certainties to their toughest test in decades.

To ensure the future at the summit in Evian
The paradox of our time is that the world's richest countries have the power to do good, but they seem to feel obliged to miss all the opportunities in this direction.
The United States are the kind of excellence: a country that spends $450 billion per year in its defence budget and spending only $12 billion per year in development aid in poor countries.
They can bomb Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq, but they are poorly equipped to help these regions to develop.
Europe is not in better position, paralysed as it is by internal divisions and budget deficits.
At the G8 summit next week at Evian, France will take a chance to start again.
For a billion people which is represented at the G8 summit, life is relatively well compared to the rest of the planet, with incomes of $25,000 per person and a life expectancy of around 80 years.
For about three billion people in the world at present, including China, most of India and the East Asia, economic development continues relatively well, even if it has many ups and downs (most recently, the shock of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome).
The economic trends are also the day in Brazil and Mexico.
But for the remaining two billion, life is hopeless.
For around a billion between them, their survival is precarious.
Millions of people die each year without access to medicines, food, clean drinking water and basic hygiene.
Their life expectancy is often less than 50 years and fall in many areas.
The G-8 could end the suffering billions of the world's most impoverished people if it were realistic steps to solve their problems.
It does not because it is not just greedy but also fearful.
We believe that world poverty is inevitable and too expensive to eradicate.
But it can solve the problems of the poorest, with comparatively less effort and without significant negative impact on its own level of life.
The problem areas the most important are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, in the Andean region and Central Asia.
Other pockets of extreme poverty in China and India are on the way of improving thanks to rapid economic growth of these two giants.
But the problems in sub-Saharan Africa, in the Andes and Central Asia are not solved for themselves.
These regions are trapped in poverty.
Africa is the most affected.
The US government believes that these countries have themselves if they are poor.
But it is the vantardise ignorant of a rich country that does not understand the situation on the ground.
Africa is trapped in poverty for reasons deeply rooted.
It is suffering from malaria endemic, which resembles an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which would last for centuries, and not for a few months.
It is suffering a climate prone to drought and the massive soil nutrients are exhausted.
It is the fact that most of its population lives in rural areas, with cobbled streets to achieve the ports and to facilitate access to international trade.
Apart from a West African countries, it is suffering a serious shortage of energy (coal, oil and hydroelectric power).
The United States have never been grappling with problems of the scale of those occurring in Africa.
The ultimate irony, these serious problems can be solved, whatever the cost.
This is where the G8 should intervene.
The only commitment that must take the G8 leaders at Evian is to follow in their previous promises that have not been kept for years.
Over the past three years, world leaders have promised to take concrete measures to reduce global poverty by half by the year 2015, in a series of commitments known as the Millennium Development Goals.
But only small measures were taken.
The United States have increased aid to $4 billion per year while they have also increased military spending of $150 billion a year and cut taxes for a trillion dollars.
It is clear that America has the means to do more to very large scale to help poor countries around the world, if only they did.
The G8 leaders should commit to provide financial support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, to increase food productivity in Africa through a new green revolution, to ensure that all the poor children can be in school and that all the poor peoples of all countries have access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
The total cost of this problem would be markedly less than 1% of annual income in rich countries.
For the first time in history, the rich are so rich and poor so poor that a tiny effort of the rich could end the suffering is enormous.
The summit in Evian would clarify the situation and whether the greed and ignorance and the grandiloquence of war have completely ignored US and Europe and Japan will watch themselves rather than outside.

Good reasons to slow population growth
The global talks on the demographic policies are disturbing.
On one side, arguing that the growth of human populations threat to our environment and our prosperity.
The land, water, energy and biodiversity all seem to have a stress more important than ever, and population growth appears to be responsible in large part.
The debate in rich countries mainly on households and small numbers of children that they have insufficient to take care of their aging parents.
Those who worry about population growth have the best arguments.
The questions to which Europe, Japan and to some extent the United States, as some middle income countries must face in terms of ageing population are manageable.
The benefits of slowing population growth offset the costs of adjustment.
If the world populations continue to grow rapidly, the pressure on global resources will become more acute.
Governments should therefore be put in place policies at increasing the birth rate, even where birth rates are low.
The confusion of public debate partly reflects various demographic trends in different parts of the world.
The most rapid population growth occurs in the poorest regions.
Poor people, particularly the agricultural populations, tend to have a greater number of children (often up to six per woman) and the population growth rate.
The families of poor farmers rely on their children for the standard, the firm and the safety of parents when they get old.
Poor families lack access to contraception and family planning.
Finally, poor families are doing a lot of children as to insure against the high infant mortality.
The fact of the birth rate is very high in Africa, the United Nations Population Division provides the doubling of the African population by 2050, is the passage of 900 million today to 1.8 billion.
The people to rapid population growth are also young populations because of the large number of children in homes.
In Africa, the average age today is 19 years and it is clear that there will be around 28 years in 2050.
In Europe, the trends are reversed.
The United Nations a decline of the population will fall to around 630 million in 2050, against 725 million today.
With fewer children and a longer life expectancy, the population has risen sharply in these forecasts and passes for 39 years in 2005 to 48 years in 2050.
For the whole world, the population is supposed to continue to grow 2.5 billion between 2005 and 2050.
The full in the developing world: 1.3 billion extra in Asia, 900 million more in Africa, and the rest in Latin America and in other regions.
Increasing the global population of 2.5 billion human beings will increase pressure not only on the companies where the population growth has happened but also on the whole planet.
Overall energy consumption is taking off, reflecting the effect of increasing per capita income (and thus increasing the energy consumption per capita) and the people.
The high consumption of energy, climate change already dangerous.
In addition, the tensions created by the global population growth coupled with higher incomes are at a rapid deforestation, the loss of fisheries, to soil degradation and loss of natural habitats and the extinction for a number of animal and plant species.
Population growth in developing regions, particularly in Africa, India and in other parts of Asia, should slow down.
The public policy can play an important role in improving the services of access to family planning for poor people, by extending the social systems of care, reducing infant mortality, thanks to investments in public health and improving education and access to employment of women.
Part of the European public, noting the decline of European populations that threat, to take the opposite and promote the return to large families.
This would be a mistake.
The defenders of a demographic growth accelerated in Europe are worried about the lack of manpower young to ensure public pensions.
But this concern that can be handled by savings from the people young and middle-aged preparing their pensions and working beyond the age of 65.
These workers will gain greater benefits if they live in people with stable or slightly industries.
Their household expenditure directly linked to the education of children will obviously be less important.
They will save in investments related to infrastructure such as the new roads, energy plants, schools and other public services.
They also benefit from cities less congested and less pressure on the environment in the campaign.
The European economies will have less cost to take over the limit on greenhouse gases due to the energy consumption, which will lead to more effective control of climate change.
In short, the quality of life will improve with the decline of the European population in coming years.
There is nothing radical here to call the slowdown of population growth.
For tens of thousands of years, the human population has tended to increase and decrease without really show a trend set in the long term.
This is that over the centuries with the rise of the modern economic life that the world population soared, passing a billion people around in 1820 to 6.3 billion today and 9 billion projected for 2050.
The explosive growth has been made possible thanks to the huge advances in science and technology.
But this unprecedented growth has also set our planet to the test.
We should intensify our efforts to slow population growth on a voluntary, and we should recognise that the stabilisation of the world population would be now a more human happiness and increase the sustainability of the environment for the future.

Foreign investors are still relevant?
Global flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have soared over the past twenty years from $40 billion in the early 1980s to 900 billion dollars last year.
The cumulative stock of FDI has reached nearly $10 trillion, which is the most important mechanism granting of goods and services to foreign markets: sales by the foreign subsidiaries are roughly 19 trillion, compared to the global exports of 11 trillion.
Meanwhile, the liberalisation of the FDI in virtually every country is a major force for trade between the companies, the vital source of emerging system integrated production and international already about a third of global trade.
But this beautiful time is coming to an end?
If the FDI can provide many benefits, it has sometimes costs.
In the 1970s, when the transnational corporations (Stn), which is in such investments have begun to point out, many governments have believed that the costs of FDI exceeded their profits and have therefore controlled.
The pendulum, held by developed countries, has begun to wave in the 1980s.
Once regarded as part of the problem, the FDI has become a solution to economic growth and development.
Nothing illustrates better than the changes in the national systems of FDI.
As reports the UN Conference on Trade and Development, among the 2 156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004, 93% were aimed at creating an environment more hospitable to the Stn.
But the risk that the pendulum is set to turn round is real, resulting in a decline of this process of liberalisation.
The FDI in developed countries (and increasingly in emerging markets) often takes the form of cross-border mergers and acquisitions.
The resistance to such steps is becoming more frequent when they involve companies that politicians regard as a "national champions' or play a role in national security, economic development or cultural identity.
The growing involvement of private equity firms in the activities of mergers and acquisitions of other controversies, because of such transactions are typically considered purely speculative.
In the name of "economic patriotism," security and other considerations, resistance to mergers and acquisitions to codify in an increasing number of countries.
For example, a US Senate panel recently tried to block the liberalisation of the rules for foreign takeover for airlines, and Europe has set up more restrictive laws on the takeover bid.
In addition, governments are more stringent regulatory provisions on the control of a takeover bid by foreign companies.
The answer is linked to a defensive reaction to the growing role of Stn emerging markets, the 'small news. "
The Stn already well established, and their country of origin, to adapt to this new constellation of strength and its implications for the global market.
Like other circumstances we have learned, it is not easy to adapt to the newcomers: Compare, for example, the reaction provoked by the rapprochement between the French Alcatel and Lucent, an American takeover by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Chevron and Mittal for acelor.
Another kind of defensive reaction this time against the FDI, could well occur when the relocation services will be taken to speed.
All indications are that the offshoring has achieved a level and that this phenomenon is to be speeded up through the FDI.
If the countries of origin put in place of adjustment mechanisms to adapt to rapid revolution which makes negotiable the jobs of the services sector, a political backlash against such an FDI to the outside will be inevitable.
The growing malaise caused by the FDI is currently confined to developing countries.
Some signs indicate, however, that it extends to emerging markets.
In the case of large-scale projects, some of the host countries raise questions on contracts that define their relationship with the Stn, and governments to review such contracts because they think (rightly or wrongly) that they have not received a fair market.
One of the 219 to international arbitration known for investment projects, some two thirds were initiated during the past three years.
The approaches of the FDI has changed in the past, and they can still change in the future, according to how governments see the balance of costs and benefits.
This means not only economic factors, but also considerations such as safety and the desire to control a country's economic development.
The concept of 'nationalisation of the 21st century, "introduced by the Peruvian presidential candidate Ollanta Humala, reflects the" economic patriotism "of the French prime minister Dominique de Villepin.
The reservations against the FDI (as with everything that is alien) are in all groups of countries, and when politicians are at the forefront protectionism is not far away.
It is ironic that the developed countries, who led the wave of liberalisation of FDI in the past twenty years, starting a movement.
Hope that the movement of dé-libéralisation which is taking place in the developed countries can be monitored before it from spreading to other parts of the world and to all undesirable consequences.

The culture of energy
The global warming to the volatile oil prices, a global energy crisis seems to happen.
To meet this challenge, humanity cannot afford to ignore the finite resource of organic materials that the sun provides each day through photosynthesis.
Solar energy allows plants to absorb carbon and so produce not just of oxygen, but also the matter that the animal kingdom is used to feed themselves, and that our machines can use to obtain energy.
Since the Neolithic, humans are growing this biomass to feed themselves.
À our times its energy potential is ignored.
À from the industrial revolution, humans have sought the energy from coal, and later in the oil and natural gas, which led to the depletion of resources that are not renewable.
The alternatives to diversify energy production are limited.
Nuclear power has a number of objections, particularly in terms of security and radioactive waste.
The hydroelectric power is already widely used, as the wind and solar energy, they are structurally sporadic and available unevenly.
Biomass, however, has several advantages.
It is widespread, in large quantities in the world.
In addition, we can control long since the technology needed for the converted into energy, including the carbonisation high-yield, gasification and the disintegration of fuel.
This technology widely used during World War II, has experienced considerable progress since.
The energy of biomass, however, is a victim of unfair competition from fossil fuels.
Oil prices reflect its extraction, its refining and distribution costs, but not those of the creation of the raw material.
Millions of years and 200 tonnes of plants are required to produce a litre of petrol, while it takes 15 kilos of plant material to produce a litre of fuel compact.
When oil was sinking afloat in less than $20 per barrel, the attraction of the development of renewable energy from biomass has fallen and there was more interested as the militants' green 'and those involved with basic science.
But the potential is huge.
The biomass of the planet: the forests, grasslands, the savanes and cultures, is a productive capital which generates a "yield" of 10% each year.
À the image of a battery that is empty and recharge thanks to the sun, it is renewable indefinitely, as long as it is properly managed.
The yield on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tonnes, and yet only two billion tonnes are used for food and 10 billion tonnes for energy purposes.
Increase the responsible use of this source of energy would help to combat climate change by reducing the proportion of carbon in the atmosphere and reducing the amount of fossil fuel needed to produce energy.
In addition to its abundance in the South promises to facilitate their economic development.
Regarded as "energy of the poor" until today, biomass could become a source of wealth, provided that it is grown and used with the support of the international community.
As well, "energy crops" could be developed for the production of biofuel.
The remnants of forestry, agriculture and agro-industrielles could be collected and converted.
The six million tonnes of waste each year by Niger could theoretically be used to satisfy the needs of this country.
Growing energy would surely competition for food crops in many countries.
The estimates on the long term plans for 50 years, most arable land in the world should be used to produce food and for the protection of Forest Resources.
Therefore, areas dedicated to the energy production, including biofuels, may not achieve the desired level by companies.
But that such a competition reveals new global shortages, it could lead to price increases, thereby encouraging producers to increase their yields and productivity.
Although the culture of energy would create new constraints, but it would also open new opportunities for many economic players.
The farmer and the Forestry manager could invest in the market, the minor look to crops, the banker to plant, etc.
It is necessary to implement new policies in the north and south, in terms of agriculture, water management and the Earth, protection of biodiversity, taxation of fuel, information and public awareness, to prepare for an increase in energy crops.
The old Égyptiens and Incas used the cult of the sun, because they thought he was on the origin of life on Earth.
Science has given them since.
Today, when it became more important than ever to use renewable resources, we should use the sun to grow our energy, like our ancestors did for their food.

The culture of the creation of company
The world's governments want to encourage the creation of businesses.
Even though many start-ups will become ever more significant, every small business is an experience, and we need much to give birth to one that could transform the economy of a nation, or even just to gain international dimension.
In short, the creation of company is an incubator, also important to long-term economic success.
Nowadays, to explain the differences in terms of companies, we look at the divergence in attitudes and national policies.
But it must also take into account differences within the country.
Residents of Shanghai are apparently more daring to this point of view that those in Beijing.
The inhabitants of the Ukrainian city of Kherson are more than those in Kiev.
In a recent study, mariassunta Giannetti and Andrei Simonov, of the Stockholm School of Economics, showed the extent of differences in the area of the creation of businesses in the cities in Sweden.
They define the entrepreneurs like people who say the resources from companies they control and in which they work at least part-time, and see that the proportion of business leaders in the population differs substantially in the 289 cities they have studied, varying from 1.5% to 18.5%.
We say these differences on the real causes for the creation of company?
The variations policies at national level can justify the variations identified by Gianetti and Simonov.
In the 1980s and early 1990's, the central agreements on the threshold of wages have been dissolved and the Swedish government has reduced income taxes and businesses.
Accordingly, the number of creating business has doubled in the country, but the response was very different from a city to another.
Why?
The variables cultural seem to take a large part: half of the variations is due to the religion and the municipal politics.
The cities are more entrepreneurs when they have a large proportion of pensioners are members of the Église Sweden (church of État official until 2000) and an electorate of the right result.
In addition, there is a phenomenon of cause: the cities that are the most entrepreneurs tend to create even more.
Once a culture of creation of company takes root, it extends to measure that people know of advantage on the business world and are starting to feel attracted -- even if the benefits are not immediately.
Indeed, Giannetti and Simonov found that the average income of CEO is lower in the cities with more companies in those who are less.
Similarly, studies from other countries show that entrepreneurs are often less at the start, and see their income increase less quickly than if they had been employed.
These studies suggest that the differences in terms of the creation of businesses are perhaps less due to better economic opportunities (the "supply" of the equation for the creation of company) to the cultural differences that make the creation of businesses more fulfilling a personal point of view (the "calls").
This assumption is highlighted by Giannetti and Simonov, who believe that the differences of prestige of entrepreneurs in the various cities can justify the disparities.
In some boroughs, business leaders have a high social status, they are successful or not; they are not considered and other activities are more admirées.
The idea that the prestige is important is not new.
In his book the moral and money, the sociologist Michele Lamont compares the definitions of success in France and the États-unis.
She asks the inhabitants of the two countries that means "a person of value."
In fact, it is consulting on what they consider important in life and their sense of identity.
The study of Lamont has confirmed the conventional wisdom that for the Americans, the success in business is important, while the French place before any culture and quality of life.
Similarly, contempt opened for business people, "tough greed" and the competition is more often in France than in America.
But while Lamont focuses on the differences between French and American, the discovery the most interesting research is significant differences between various regions of France.
It compares Clermont-Ferrand, chef-lieu the Auvergne in central France, and Paris.
The auvergnats have a reputation for thrift and discipline, and despite recent progress very generously relative shortage of culture.
Lamont has found that both in Paris that the clermontois have tended to have distain for greed.
However, the clermontois believe the simplicity, pragmatism, the work, and the will, as the Parisians relate more to the force and the talent.
It concludes that, in many ways, the clermontois are closer to the Hoosiers (the inhabitants of the American État of Indiana, in the Midwestern) that Parisians.
His research suggests that in Clermont-Ferrand, demand content creation of businesses is stronger than in Paris.
Almost all countries are units of local cultures that differ in their way to motivate people and to shape their identity.
The differences in how they define what that means a person of value, and how this value is, probably explain a lot of changes in levels of companies.
Economists are not only to see the country together, and to appoint the attitudes and national policies as the main factors of encouragement and the creation of businesses.
But the success in this field depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with the national policies.
The enthusiasm for the creation of company can take root in any region culturally attractive to any country, once removed the economic constraints, which are Dam, then acquire national importance in the Fed itself.

University investments
Yale University, where I teach, entrusts his fund of funds to one person, David Swensen for over 20 years ago.
During this period, this portfolio has risen from just over 1 billion to $18 billion -- an average yield of more than 16% per year, which is the highest of all the major universities.
And it shows no sign of weakness; at the last fiscal year is waning in June, the yield was 22,9%.
If the presidents of Yale's succession, Swensen remains.
It has done more to the university than any other president, or anyone else.
In a university, the ideas are worth more than money, but $18 billion can create an environment conducive to many new ideas.
With 11 500 students, it is more than 1.5 million dollars per student (not counting the buildings of the University or its collection of art, worth several billion dollars each).
How has this been possible?
How Swensen he could earn as much money?
Everyone is the demand -- including us, at Yale.
Indeed, many here is "the efficient markets hypothesis," which claims that the financial markets worldwide have become so competitive that it is impossible to obtain a return on investment, higher than normal.
Anyone who breaks the market has just a stroke of luck.
The studies seem to confirm this phenomenon.
For example, an inquiry in 2004 by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the University of California, yi-tsung Lee and yiu-jane Liu of the National Chengchi University, has collected data transactions per transaction on the day traders of the stock market in Taiwan.
The study revealed that only 1% of day traders engrangeaient a profit -- after deducting transaction costs -- during both periods of six consecutive months, and that means was just such an effort: $4,000.
It is easy to conclude that it is futile to try to beat the market.
But then we think about people like Swensen.
The consistency of its good results can be attributed to luck?
Robert Kiyosaki, author of the series of books to success on the investment Rich Dad, Poor's dad, the Securities and the themes of his works on a comparison between his father very graduate and the father of his friend, who left school in fourth.
According À Kiyosaki, his father scholar, but impécunieux have tended to be pessimistic about the possibilities for everyone to achieve something in real life, and had discouraged his son to try.
However, the father of his friend loved to try to do great things.
The fact that it has become rich is it a coincidence?
Kiyosaki is perhaps too much to be inspiring, but I often think of him when I hear teachers finance pronounce on the efficiency of markets and nonsense that there has to earn money through the transactions.
It may be that many academics are difficult to take action in the real world -- and I have not yet met other Professor claiming to have read Kiyosaki.
But Swensen is a university doctor in economics.
It is surrounded by academics.
All these discussions on the efficiency of markets have not discouraged to try his luck and to get there.
There seems to be a model.
Two universities, Harvard and Princeton, have hardly had the same success.
The fund of funds from Harvard, under Jack Meyer, has increased its average annual rate of 15.2% over the past ten years, which can be compared to 17.2% of Swensen, and the allocation of Princeton, under Andrew Golden, won by an average 15.6% per year.
In fact, Golden has worked under the auspices of Swensen at Yale in 1988 and 1993.
Swensen wrote two books on investment, one for professionals and one for the public.
In the closing, I have not had the impression of being able to do what it was.
But some elements are prescribed to me.
One of them is its long-term vision.
Yale is Swensen invest in the long term, and does not weary with the quarterly results.
It allows him to focus more on the fundamental long-term, and make investments that have not necessarily a good return in the short term.
But it has always had good results both short-term and long-term.
Part of the success of Swensen is "the absolute return," a term now widespread in the community of investors, he has invented to describe investment strategies unusual involving things like the arbitration on mergers and acquisitions and the difficulties distressed securities).
It has also invested in assets than traditional, as real estate, oil, timber, capital investment and venture capital and the resumption of businesses.
These assets are not generally followed by many analysts, and are not easy to understand, which gave him a greater advantage by taking advantage of intellectual capacity and expertise of his entourage.
In this direction, Swensen is completely different from the day traders, who invest in the short term while trying to beat the market the most frequented, the values in listed.
But I also think the phenomenal success of Swensen and its peers reflects the environment that Kiyosaki criticism.
The problem is a defeatist attitude, not the scholarship.
When an analytical mind, a spirit led to continue with the truth, as part of a community of such people, is released from the question itself, it can produce amazing things.
I know David Swensen, and I can confirm that this is not a day senior trader alone trying to beat the market.
He knows how to listen, to support people in which he has confidence, and it is surrounded by many people the qualities many and varied.
And it has nothing to a defeatist.

A moral
According to forecasts, global consumption of meat will double by 2020.
But in Europe and North America, there is increasingly on the moral aspect of the methods of production of meat and eggs.
The use of calf has fallen since he became known for producing the veal 'white' (in fact pale pink), the newborn calves are separated from their mother, anémiés voluntarily, private fibre and packed in the stalls so small that it cannot walk or go.
In Europe, the mad cow disease has shocked many, not just because it has discredited the image of food safe and healthy beef, but also because the public learned that this disease was caused by the feeding of cows and fed to brain and nervous tissue of sheep.
People who naively believed that cows eat grass, discovered that the herds for our food could eat anything, corn on the fish, of the litter of chicken (excrement included) to the waste from slaughterhouses.
The concerns raised by our way of dealing with the animals are from the small percentage of vegetarian or végétaliens, those who do not consume any product of animal origin.
Despite the strength of the moral arguments in favour of végétariennes practices, they are not yet the prevailing opinion.
The most common position is that our consumption of meat is justified by the time that animals are living a life well before being killed.
The problem, as Jim Mason and I describe in the last book, the way we eat, is that industrial agriculture is refusing to animals the chance to be correct.
Tens of billions of chicken products nowadays never go anywhere.
The conditions so that they have an appetite fierce, and waiting as soon as possible, then the pupil in hangars which may contain more than 20,000 animals.
The rate of ammonia in the air, due to the accumulation of their fientes, dig the eyes and hurts the lungs.
Killed in 45 days, their bones immature can barely support the weight of their bodies.
Some are crumbling and, unable to reach the water or food, are quick to die. Their fate is only a negligible amount to economic throughout the company.
The conditions are worse for egg-laying hens crammed in cages and son of iron, so small that even if they were one in cages, they would be unable to open the wings.
But they are usually packed with four, often more.
In such conditions of overcrowding, the hens, the more dominant and aggressive can stung to death the weakest of the cage.
To avoid it, the producers cut side of the tooth of hens with a razor.
The tooth for a chicken is full of nervous tissue. It is, after all, its main means of communication with its environment, but no anaesthetic or pain reliever is administered to alleviate the pain.
Pigs are perhaps the animals more sensitive and more intelligent than we used to eat.
When they fourragent in a rural village, they can use this intelligence to explore their surroundings and diversity.
Before, and use straw or the leaves and brindilles to build a nest of safe and comfortable when caring for their scope.
But in the intensive farming, pregnant sows are cooped up in cash so close that they cannot go, or even more of a step forward or backward.
They are on the concrete, without straw or other form of litter.
The piglets are removed from their mother as soon as possible for it to fall pregnant again, but they never leave the hangar before being led to the slaughterhouse.
Advocates of these methods of production argue that it is a regrettable but necessary to the demand for food to a population continues to grow.
Instead, when we confinons animals in the intensive farming, we need to produce food for them.
The animals burn most of the energy provided by the food just to breathe and heat their bodies, we are therefore in the end only a small fraction, usually no more than a third and sometimes only a tenth of the value of food that we give them.
However, cows and very light basis in the fields are eating food that we cannot digest, which means that they add to the quantity of food that is available.
It is tragic that countries like China and India, as they get richer, copy the methods of Western and parquent animals in huge industrial farms to provide more meat and eggs at their middle classes in the development.
If this continues, the result will be of animal suffering bigger even than currently exists in the West, more damage to the environment and an increase in heart disease and cancer of the digestive system.
This will also be completely ineffective.
As consumers, we have the power and moral obligation, to refuse to support the methods of farming cruel to animals and bad for us.

The fear and freedom on the Internet
We learned earlier this month at the request of Chinese leaders, Microsoft had closed the website of a Chinese blogger sheltered by a service of Microsoft called MSN Spaces.
The blogger, Zhao Jing, was published details of a strike of the journalists at the Beijing New, who had followed the referral of the editor libre-penseur newspaper.
The gesture of Microsoft raises a key issue: the Internet can really be a liberating force that authoritarian governments cannot control as easily as newspapers, radio and television?
Ironically, when you think that the founder and leader of Microsoft, Bill Gates, has been an enthusiastic supporter of this view.
In October last year, he said: "There is really no way at large to suppress information today, and I think this is a wonderful must all be happy... this is a means of communication to open and a total freedom, and this is what makes it so singular."
Despite these sentiments, Microsoft help its best the Chinese authorities to censor the information.
A spokesman for Microsoft said that the company had blocked "many sites in China, and it is known for several months that the tool used to make Chinese bloggers filters words like 'democracy' and 'human rights" when they appear in the titles of personal sites.
The defence of Microsoft is that it must comply with the laws of local and global. "
But the sites of MSN Spaces are hosted by the États-unis servers.
Local laws to respect in this case are those of États-unis and discussions of Zhao Jing about the strike of journalists to Beijing does not violate any of them.
There is no global law preventing the Chinese to discuss events that their government would prefer not to see them.
The New York Times, for example, is free to publish articles on the strike, even if it is broadcast on a website that all Internet users with free access can consult.
If the Chinese government does not want its people read a newspaper, that is to find a way to block access.
The newspaper did nothing to do so in his place.
The defence of Microsoft is long past.
We can only guess the real reasons that led to the closing the site; and fears of impact on its commercial interests in China could be a major factor.
Admittedly, a company can and should be limits in the use of its services.
The line absolutist, which is to allow complete freedom to prevail, collapses in the face of irritating examples.
According to Gates, Microsoft could prevent the use of its services if they were used to broadcast instructions to manufacture a nuclear bomb, to send the Nazi propaganda in Germany, where it is illegal, or to spread the child pornography.
These examples are they really count?
In its traditional defence of freedom of expression, freedom, John Stuart Mill said that the most important reason to allow freedom of expression is to promote competition between the ideas the widest possible, and that the debate without hindrance is the best way of testing.
Protecting the ideas of criticism, the government become rigid dogma and life, they are true or not.
If we agree with Mill, then one example of Gates corresponds to the category of expressions to be protected.
The revenue to manufacture nuclear bombs are technical, not ideas.
The child pornography is not an expression of ideas.
So we can reduce both without contradicting the thesis of Mill.
(a trial, saying that there was nothing wrong for adults to be interested sexually to children, and that such behaviour should be admitted, speaking of ideas, and so disgusting that they can seem, as such should not be censored.)
The most difficult of three examples of Gates is the pro-nazies statements on a site aimed at Germany.
It is easily understandable that Germany wants to ban such views.
The laws of many countries ban incitement to racial hatred, which can be justified, in agreement with the defence of freedom of Mill, if such laws focus closely on incitement to hatred rather than on the removal of theories, too bad they may be, that appeal to the intellectual capacity of people.
A defender of the removal of Nazi ideas could argue that they have already been tried, and they have failed, the most appalling way imaginable, to produce a better society.
Nevertheless, the best possible sign that would show that Germany has exceeded its Nazi past would focus its laws specifically on racial hatred, rather than on the Nazis as such.
In all cases, the crackdown by China to direct reporting and discussions about the events taking place in this country does not return to the removal of a discredited political ideology, but that of an open political debate and argued.
If Bill Gates really believe that the Internet should play a role in liberating force, it should ensure that Microsoft is not doing the dirty work of the Chinese government.

The weaknesses of a strong dollar
It is always dangerous to write an article on the exchange rate.
If the exchange rate of a currency falls, it can be up when the article seems.
Is the continuing question of how to think the exchange rate and their proper management.
The issue here is not only the dollar which is falling, but rather what American officials intend to implement.
Paul O'Neill, the very direct US Treasury secretary, suggests that the États-unis cannot and will not intervene to support the dollar.
His remarks have been criticised by some who see an abandonment of the strong dollar policy caractérisa the Clinton administration.
One of the responsibilities relating to the economic leadership is to dispel myths, certainly not creating them.
The politics of "strong dollar ’ is a particularly egregious example of the myths that can develop. This myth suggests that the Treasury could, and would like to maintain a strong dollar, and that a strong dollar would be beneficial to the États-unis.
When I led the White House Economic Council, I was often asked if I supported the strong dollar policy.
I would always that I supported the dollar.
In other words, exchange rates are no different from others.
As the price of apples or oranges, they should be set by the market.
Anyone who déclarerait prefer a policy of "orange strong" would be immediately laughed at.
And yet, many appear to have the utmost confidence in the market to see the exchange rate as governed by laws, other than those of the mainstream economy that would make a word or even a simple glance from the finance minister could raise or lower the currencies.
The foreign exchange markets are of course very irrational.
Keynes described a day the market values as a beauty contest where the aim was not to assess the smartest person but the other would crown.
The aim of a foreign exchange market, in fact, is often guess what others think.
And even if the government policies can affect the exchange rate in the short term, in the long term, only the market rules are.
The government can find a legitimate role to play in limiting the market volatility, but if the basic rules of the market does not lead the charge of exchange rates, where does our confidence in the market?
Stick to concepts false inevitably leads to greater misunderstandings.
He came a day that one journalist asked the US Treasury secretary on the negative effects of the strong dollar in terms of exports (at the time, sales of cars and other exports are suffering from the strong dollar).
He replied that a strong dollar meant that the economy was strong and that exports are found.
Despite everything, even the Ministry of Finance, as strong as it is, can undo the laws of the market economy.
The levels of demand flagging: Well, when prices are high, Americans are less relaxed, and a strong dollar means that the American products more expensive.
The counterpoint to the most significant of the strong dollar policy is that it encourages precisely this confusion between a strong dollar and a strong economy.
We should not focus continues to exchange rates more than at any price.
An exchange rate high discourages exports, and deal with the unemployment of its work force, a country can see its economy to go from bad to worse.
Moreover, an exchange rate could also help to bring inflation down, since the import price falls.
If inflation is the first concern when an exchange rate could prove beneficial for the economy.
The strong dollar policy reeks of smacks of an economic nationalism, which stands out in the era of globalisation.
If the dollar is strong, then the euro and yen weakened.
And so what are the reactions of political leaders of other countries?
Are they simply have to comply with the strong dollar policy, even if it means a policy of the yen and weak?
It is necessary to create the conditions of a debate with the États-unis since the policy of the strong dollar leads to a rather unusual position: the richest country seems unable to live up to its resources and must constantly borrow hundreds of billions of dollars abroad to finance its huge trade deficit.
The strong dollar fueled the bilateral deficit with Japan more than protectionism Japanese did.
It has also contributed to the protectionist policy of États-unis that we see today in the price of steel.
It is time the insanity of the strong dollar policy should be abandoned.
Paul O'Neill should be praised for its efforts in this area.
Perhaps we could now start thinking seriously about the creation of an international economic system taking account of the devastating effects of the volatility of the main currencies for the least developed countries to ensure greater stability.
We have for too long accused the victims.
It has served only to avoid seriously consider the system itself.

China's mistaken her world?
Cheating.
How, say the US, China could undercut American producers in all areas?
For decades, America has seemed to dominate the production so that American officials have focused on the liberalization of trade for manufactured products.
They have spent as little effort to establish an equality for farmers because they knew that America could not compete on the plan.
China is now on the other countries, gets a huge trade surpluses with the United States.
The US Treasury secretary and accuse China of keeping its exchange rate deliberately low and ask him to leave the trends of the market determine the value of reminbi.
The IMF chief economist Ken Rogoff, who leaves his post, warns that trade surpluses threaten global stability.
For those who recall the crisis that has occurred in East Asia five years ago, this seems to go against what was said to this time.
China had been urged not to let its currency float.
Until the implosion of the Argentine peso, the fixed exchange rates were perfectly.
The US Treasury had welcomed the government intervention in the markets of exchange rates and had encouraged the IMF to support such interventions with the méga billions of dollars to countries in crisis.
If China was again left its currency float, it would be devalued and would have intensified the crisis.
The country received a warning: avoid trade surpluses and accumulate reserves because they are the main defence.
The East Asian countries have followed this advice, for a good reason: they had already seen the consequences of a lack of reserves.
The governments of East Asia knew when the policies of the IMF will only lead to worsen the economic downturn, but they found themselves unable to resist it.
The IMF had the money they had an urgent need.
China and Malaysia, lucky enough to not having to turn to the IMF or courageous enough to follow their own line, acted as it should: they have conducted the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies.
China's economy has continued to grow at 7%, Malaysia, has seen the economic downturn as short and shallow.
To understand the stakes of this fight, it is necessary to explain a few fundamental economic concepts in detail.
First, international trade is based on the principle of comparative advantage; the countries export goods in which they have an advantage on and bring those in which they have a disadvantage relative.
Overall, America currently has a relative disadvantage in terms of manufacturing, while China has a relative advantage.
China must export manufactured products to the US.
Secondly, if a country invests more than savings, it will be forced to borrow and therefore a trade deficit.
The trade deficit is emerging in America is the result of mismanagement, unprecedented for the Bush administration.
The tax cuts that America could barely afford have transformed a huge surplus in a massive fiscal deficit, rather than to make savings, the American government borrowing, including a large part abroad.
It is this bad management, and not the exchange rate policy of China, which is the culprit.
In fact, the overall trade surplus in China is currently low (about 1% of GDP).
Of course, the Bush administration wants to lay the blame on others, but neither China nor any other country, should not be cheated.
This situation reminds me of events 20 years ago, when President Reagan had drawn up huge tax cuts to rectify the situation, but who have actually resulted in huge fiscal deficits, which in turn led to huge trade deficits.
At that time was in Japan that America had rejected the responsibility of these deficits.
The truth is that neither the IMF or the Bush administration does not truly believe in free markets.
They are hampering the markets when they can find their interest.
The Bush administration rebuild of airlines, has made the unprecedented subsidies for agriculture and has protected the tariffs imposed on steel.
The IMF is right: there is a real risk of global instability, but the underlying cause of this threat lies in the massive borrowing undertaken by the US abroad, which began under President Ronald Reagan.
The US has become a debtor country to the enormous debts.
If, one day, creditors of America decided to be reimbursed, they could trigger large movements of exchange rates and thus cause a global instability.
Why the IMF not criticised severely these deficits?
Why the world's richest country should live beyond its means when the IMF scolding the poorest countries for transgressions less important?
This problem is compounded by the global reserve system which welcomes the demands of most countries in US dollars, but only penalise them more.
The system requires that the country that holds the reserve currency (in this case, the US) is piling up debts until the other countries do more confidence.
But to solve the problems deeply rooted in the global financial system, we must overcome the complacency which has long been invaded the G-7 and unilateralism that defines the current American administration.
China has had reason to ignore the demands of America.
The flotation of the exchange rate would have exposed the country to the instability that would have led to a host of other problems, which would particularly hit the banking system precarious.
An exchange rate higher than would have shaken the process of job creation and contributed to deflation, that China is currently off.
China has the chance to have the freedom to pursue its own targets.
Its huge foreign reserves to ignore the IMF and the Department of Finance.
Finally, this could be the most compelling reason why China must continue to maintain the trade surpluses.
Again, China has shown his mastery of the basic economic principles.
The other countries in the region lamenting its loss of not having done likewise.

Italy will survive for Berlusconi?
If history seems to support Silvio Berlusconi in the category of Italian prime ministers, he will leave the memory of a prime minister out of the ordinary and more bizarre.
Make a promise, but to take another has been a principle of government action as a weakness.
Given the unpredictable nature, it is hardly surprising that since the election of 2001, which has brought to power, the center-left coalition the Unione has won all the elections that followed (administrative elections, regional and European).
But the success of the left for the next parliamentary elections is not guaranteed and the fate of Berlusconi is not yet sealed.
Given the country's economic situation, you would think Italy ripe for change.
For four years ago, the average income has risen by only 0.3% per year, whereas it has increased by an average of 1.5% in the European Union, and for two years the public debt began to grow.
The strategy of the center-right coalition of Berlusconi, Casa della Alliance, has been to do nothing until the European economy is recovering, instead of addressing the structural problems in Italy.
This is why this is not only the unions who criticise the government but also the Cofindustria employers' organisation which had put its weight behind Berlusconi in 2001.
There is also the incessant conflict of interests between Berlusconi and the Prime Minister Berlusconi tycoon the press, which holds licenses in the area television that give it a position of semi-monopole advertising in the media and on television.
During his term, his personal fortune was multiplied by three.
The parliamentary majority voted number of laws in favour of his personal interests and has flattened some of the legal obstacles that are on his way. However, beginning March, Berlusconi has again been accused of corruption and tax fraud.
The conduct of its ministers has been little better.
Two of them, Roberto Calderoli and Francesco Storace, have been forced to resign for months.
The first, a leader of the Northern League, the third party's coalition government in order of importance, has caused riots in Libya, wearing a T-shirt with the ghastly cartoons of Prophet Mohammed.
The second, former health minister and one of the leaders of the National Alliance, the second of the coalition government, is suspected to be the source of spying, a political Watergate to the Italian.
Despite this catalogue, both in terms of the economy of ethics, according to polls, the Unione displays an advance of four points, too little in terms of the number of undecided voters to predict the election result.
What makes that Berlusconi and his coalition are still in the race?
First, the election campaign of Berlusconi, as Bush in 2004, aims to mobilize its supporters and attracting a growing mass "of non-voters.
For this, it did not hesitate to use its semi-monopole on television to sing the so-called marvels performed by his government.
His rhetoric of campaigning is based on a anti-Communism, that we had not seen in Italy since 1948, coupled with a defence of the family values and expensive to the establishment of the Roman Catholic church, although the church should not have so far left to draw in the campaign.
The coalition of Berlusconi is also benefit from the weakness of the Unione.
Its leader, Romano Prodi, has won popular support and more than four million votes cast in primary elections, the first of this kind in Italy.
But without a party, he continues to be at the head of too many parties.
The cohesion of the Unione has increased: the two main parties (Democratici di Democratic Party and Democrazia e alliance - the Margherita) gathered behind the emblem of the tree, the other parties are set daccord on a programme for government detailed in a document of 280 pages and the Left Party Partito Della as fortuitous as it has given signs of moderation devoid of any ambiguity and loyalty to the coalition.
Still, to the voters, the coalition remains fragile.
Finally, uncertainty about the election result does not reflect both the attitude of voters that a change of the electoral system.
During the last decade, the Italian electoral system was based on a majority vote on a tour with a dose of proportional representation.
With this system, Casa della Alliance has succeeded in 2001 to transform a small advance elections in a parliamentary majority.
But, fearing that this system is now to the Unione, the parliamentary majority of centre-right has changed the electoral rules only a few months before the end of its mandate.
This is reminiscent of the military strategy which is to defeat looming on the battlefield, poison the well before retreating.
A proportional system without a chance to choose individual candidates that the secretaries of parties, rather than the people who choose members, and in the absence of a real election threshold, the parties are proliferating.
The voting papers will be 40 centimeters long for that included all the symbols of the old and new parties, but we will not find the name of one candidate.
But the more serious is that the electoral system for the Senate could lead to a majority opposed to that of Parliament, leading to a political deadlock.
And this is not everything, the term of president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will be completed at a time when parliament will be dissolved, which means that his successor who will be elected by the new members may have to appoint a government with a majority in each chamber.
Berlusconi and Prodi have ruled out a grand coalition of the kind of that which exists in Germany, a result is highly unlikely after a campaign in which each of the two candidates made clear that the other was not the legitimate right to govern.
And an election more would not solve the problem of the electoral system.
The headache of political survival of Berlusconi reflects a wider problem at European level.
Many Europeans, and not just the Italians, are worried and do not know where the continent is heading.
It is not surprising that an opportunistic and a quack like Berlusconi continues to hold the hearing.
The Italians must decide for the future of their country if they want a leader who has the stature needed.

The game of the trans-Atlantic criticism
As if the diplomatic spats over Iraq was not enough, relations between America and Europe are slowly poisoned by the economic policies differ.
Indeed, the differences between the economic strategies on both sides are as sharply as they have been over two decades.
At first sight, the depth of this "political divide" seems surprising.
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and in 2004 have recently improved in both the US and Europe.
The US and Europe are facing a similar challenge: to promote economic recovery.
But the actions of their government (or rather the lack of action) seem to indicate that none of the two sides cannot see the problems faced by the other.
During the introduction of the euro, most of the EU (Germany, in particular) have looked forward to manage their economic policies with greater autonomy and American pressure less strong.
The current structure in the euro zone, with its unique mix of monetary policy and national responsibility for a fiscal policy, was not built to facilitate the macro-economic coordination with the USA.
But the perception of many Americans was different.
They saw the central involvement of the euro as forcing Europe to be stripped of its role in "free-rider" on the international economic scene, a role that has left the United States shoulder the burden of adjustment policies to promote global growth.
Europe will inevitably be forced to coordinate policy with America.
These two views were doomed to come into conflict and it is happening today.
The tensions overshadowed in the long boom of the Clinton era have proved in 2001 when America has tried to cope with the decline of its economy by releasing its monetary and fiscal policy.
When the huge budget deficits refirent surface, the European scepticism about the viability of the external deficit in America and the strength of the dollar also returned.
Meanwhile, criticism Americans have seen the euro zone as too cautious when it undercut slowly interest rates and maintint fiscal constraints the stability and growth.
Originally, the Europeans had underestimated the economic slowdown which they were facing.
Later, they have been forced by the limits imposed on their fiscal responses, limits set by the Maastricht treaty; the major economies to continental Europe had not reached a budgetary consolidation enough during the years of continuous growth.
The monetary and fiscal policies have facilitated the growth but Europe has not done much to redress the imbalance outside America.
Of course, the euro zone is so large that it cannot abdicate responsibility to stimulate global growth in America.
But the American efforts to encourage people to adopt their discretionary and pragmatic approach to economic policy lead inevitably to the frustration: the problems faced by the European economies are facing the United States, like the perceptions of the challenges.
In fact, the main reasons for wholesale change in the American public finance (of the surplus in 2000 to a deficit of over 4% in 2003-04) have little relation to stabilisation.
In addition to the costs of war in Iraq and other security issues and shortcomings in the previous controls on spending, tax cuts of the United States meet targets and structural distributionnels rather than short-term goals.
A stimulus in the short term would not have given the benefits the more significant to the richest people, whose expenses are less sensitive to taxes.
The tax cuts need to support private demand this year and next year, but at the cost of the postponement of improvements in economies and the private debt.
Although the dollar was already down for a year, continued growth in domestic demand will probably exceed the current account deficit to 5% of GDP.
While the deficit rises more, it is highly likely that the dollar should again be depreciated in spite of performance rather slow the other major economies in the world.
The United States accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004, and Europe can offer a greater contribution to global growth?
It is likely not.
The equivalent of the emphasis placed by the US on independence rather than on public assistance is represented by the desire to maintain employment at high levels, whichever party in power, while most European countries have been prepared to accept the unemployment rate of 8% or more.
The US should opt for growth.
Despite three years of low growth, the gap between the potential yield and the real return in the major economies of continental Europe is now lower than in the United States.
The tax cuts on the income to stimulate demand for labour and investment are desirable given the high rates in the greater economies of Europe.
But the tax cuts that should soon be cancelled because of population pressure exerted on pensions and public health care are unlikely to stimulate demand, the loser in consumer confidence in the government's ability to control the deficit.
Europe needs structural reforms and a more rigorous fiscal management, and not inflation.
The EU countries are finally starting to accelerate their implementation of structural reforms, but the starting point has become less favourable and political resistance too firmly anchored, as the examples of the recent conflict on the pension reforms, French and German labour market.
Further depreciation of the dollar and a slower U.S. growth would undermine exports of the EU, the only component relatively successful in demand in Europe.
The difference in policy and his time will be concealed by the prospect improved growth in Europe and the US for the next year.
But the medium-term perspective is that of a transatlantic showdown that could create as many divisions that conflicts on the war in Iraq.
If this is true, the world trade round of Doha, currently being held, could be the first to suffer.
It will be more difficult to resist protectionism of the two sides of the Atlantic.
The US cannot afford a massive drain continues to demand through an external deficit while complaints relating to the loss of competitiveness has intensified in the EU.
The thought that the confrontation of macroeconomic ahead could calm down quickly and quietly puts the imagination to test.

A multilateral engagement in favour of energy security
The countries of the world are linked to by their common need energy security by the global network, which holds the distribution of this energy.
A failure in a network, and we are all affected. The local interests and the conflicts sustainable life, especially the unresolved issue of the supplies to Ukraine and Europe in Russian gas, reminds us again that energy can be used as a means of political pressure.
Energy security is a key part of the G-8 meeting, which receives President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg.
The G-8 was able to identify the economic issue, namely the interdependence of energy, and it is time today to take the multilateral commitments in this area.
For some countries, which have the chance to have vast reserves of oil and gas, it is tempting to use of exports to the friends and punish enemies.
But these days, such a strategy is likely to destabilize both friends and enemies, and damage the producer.
Embargoes, does not generally the desired results.
The price increases triggered by the actions of OPEC in the 1970s were not tolerated and have encouraged the economies of consumption and the development of production in countries not members of OPEC.
This has caused a fall from OPEC in global exports of oil in the twelve years following the 1973-1974 embargo.
Experience has taught us that transparency and stability of prices are in the interests of all.
It is essential to increase the potential of global economic growth, to meet these principles while encouraging the development of international markets.
When Russia considered this year to multiply by four the price of its exports gas to Ukraine, it was intended to apply the market price.
It seemed right and, for some time, some politicians and investors little to the situation themselves harbor.
Let's be clear, measured and gradual price has never been challenged; some adjustments were necessary to Ukraine.
But, unfortunately for Russia's neighbours, this is not the market determines the price of gas from Russia or its transportation: this is the company Gazprom and its President Dmitry Medvedev, also first deputy prime minister.
The asking price by Gazprom is different for each country neighbouring Russia, and determined largely by diplomatic relations in those countries with the Kremlin.
The prices depend more on the political situation that supply and demand or transport costs.
Ukraine has been threatened to see its gas bill immediately increased by four -- or its supply interrupted -- because it had to take the independence from Russia during the Orange Revolution.
Georgia, which had attracted the ire of Moscow with the Rose Revolution, could also suffer significant price rises.
But the Belarus, always very close to the Kremlin, continues to qualify for subsidies in the energy sector.
Of course, Ukraine was not the only country affected by these tactics of intimidation: some providers such as Turkmenistan, that the location to smuggle the gas from Russia, suffer too.
On the consumer countries in western and central Europe, rising prices and fears of a disruption of supply have been so important consequences.
It is probably the multilateral action to the European Union and the United States prompted Gazprom to open the floodgates.
Natural gas is perhaps the first supplies is the most vulnerable to the vagaries of policies.
The pipelines connected fixed forcing producers and consumers to loyalty nearly absolute.
The diversification of the delivery of natural gas is a cross-border project in the long term, which requires considerable investment and political engagement.
Many are solutions to the study: new gas storage devices, greater efficiency, development of the production of oil and gas, and other energy sources such as methane coal.
In addition, the market liquefied natural gas (LNG) is growing rapidly.
It is easier to diversify the supply chain, even gradually, important gas producers are remote and no more suppliers neighbours with a monopoly.
All these initiatives should be able to absorb the shocks and to create greater energy self-sufficiency.
But it must go further.
First, the G-8 leaders should consider applying standards for transactions in the energy field, and demand contracts open and transparent with the best business practices.
It is essential to minimize the impact to the global scale of the behaviour of local politicians pursuing objectives not energy, or simply their personal interests.
There are problems in the business in Latin America, with political instability in Africa, tensions in the Middle East or even some brokers opaque, as the dubious contract signed for gas between Ukraine and Russia, under the name of street (RosUkrEnergo).
Ultimately, energy security for us all in Europe is based on the recognition of our interdependence.
This is why it would be useful to create a 'energy alliance "of consumers and suppliers, in which the European countries ravitailleraient each other in case of major unrest.
The energy charter, which focuses on market access and transparency, is a commendable effort, but it is inadequate in crisis. Our markets are not yet sufficiently equipped to manage interruptions of supply.
The energy charter could provide a basis for a collective energy security, provided to be deeper and wider.
It is our duty, as leaders, to find a future path to energy security.
If some tolerate today suspicious transactions by political expediency, we all pay for a day when the other.
When the inevitable conflicts arise, public confidence, the political credibility and market forces are sacrificed needlessly. This is obviously what happened with Russia and Ukraine.
The threats to energy security must be countered and resolved multilaterally with the participation of all stakeholders.
Our interdependence obliges us to adopt a multilateral approach.
This is our future is at stake.

Lebanon is in danger of manipulation
For a few weeks, the Lebanese politicians belonging to groups as diverse as Hezbollah and the Lebanese Forces Christian meet from time to time under a "national dialogue".
Their first goal is to forge a consensus on the future of Lebanon after the withdrawal of Syrian army which took place last year.
But the dialogue has also shown that the Lebanese political continues to play out of Lebanon.
The Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad El retains an enormous influence on the État Lebanese, including security issues, the Secret Service, the army and police, not to mention his alliance with the powerful militia Hezbollah.
The Syrian soldiers have left Lebanon a year ago, but the regime of El Assad has never accepted his withdrawal from Lebanon and it is seeking to regain some form of hegemony over the country.
The Syrian position is made more difficult by the UN investigation, which accuses him of being involved in the assassination of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, on 14 February 2005.
The Lebanese allies Syria wants to improve ties between the two countries, but the assassination of Hariri, they will probably not to have won.
For the moment, the Lebanese parties have agreed not to leave the country to form the basis for threatening in any way the Syrian regime.
Meanwhile, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to prevent the collapse of the regime of El Assad.
Officially the two countries are in favour of the UN investigation, but in private, their leaders have heavily pushed the Lebanese government to release the pressure on Syria.
In Lebanon, opponents of Syria have resisted this requirement, but the position of Egypt and Saudi Arabia shows that the Arab leaders do not want the fall of other despots of the region.
The attitude of Egypt and Saudi Arabia differs is more of the two Western powers very influential in Lebanon, the United States and France, which support the UN investigation wherever it leads.
However, those four countries agree that Syrian influence in Lebanon must be contained, and they are in favour, in theory, to disarm Hezbollah demanded by the Security Council resolution 1559, even if their views differ on how to get there.
Another problem, the cycle of violence between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq, also marks the domestic policy.
Lebanese Sunnis and Shiites - the two main groups in the country because of their population and the support they have in the region - are to be at this stage, but since few political tension is palpable.
Hariri was the main Sunni political leader, and after his murder, the two communities have taken positions diametrically opposed to Syria.
The gap between Shiites and Sunnis in Lebanon is much wider regional differences between the majority of Arab countries (including Saudi Arabia) who are Sunnis and support Saad Hariri, son of prime minister assassinated, and Iran, which supports Hezbollah.
In Saudi Arabia, the Shia are concentrated in the country where most of the oil fields and the Saudis fear that the discord between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq is spreading in the Arab world and reach.
This is why Riyadh has encouraged Hariri not to break the dialogue with Hezbollah, the main force within the Shiite community.
Apart from this concern, Saudi Arabia and Egypt are afraid that if Iran manages to possess nuclear weapons, it might lead to a domination of the region by Shiites.
Plus the tension between Iran and the US, fuelled by the controversy over the nuclear and the conflict in Iraq.
The Arab countries are sandwiched between the two, as the Lebanese, who fear to pay the price in case of American or Israeli attack against Iran's nuclear facilities. For Hezbollah could attack Israel from southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah interprets the resolution calling on its disarmament as a plot of the Bush administration to weaken and show American supremacy in the region.
It is refusing to disarm with what he calls "the Israeli threat", but it has so many times changed the definition because it gives the threat that one wonders whether he will never the weapons.
It has agreed recently to address this issue on the negotiating agenda of domestic policy, perhaps because Iran does not become a cause of tension in the country - but it is unlikely as they lead to a real disarmament, at least in the short term.
Finally, the Lebanese must not only manoeuvre, according to regional and international, but they must also take account of the American domestic politics.
Regardless of the opinion that it was on the Iraq war, we must agree that the American presence in this country has helped Lebanon to frustrate attempts to Syria to get up in Lebanon, and those of some Arab countries to make Lebanon to deal with a regime that ought not to its sovereignty.
If the United States are pulling out of Iraq, they may become indifferent to the situation in Lebanon.
In this case, who else that Syria and Iran from the benefits?
Such an outcome would likely be good for some elements of Lebanese society, in particular Hezbollah.
But the vast majority of Lebanese want a Lebanon in peace, beyond the insulation and activism that characterize Iran and Syria.
Unfortunately, Lebanon has always been buffeted by its environment and once more, against the will of the Lebanese, it could serve as an arena for regional conflict.

As a signal in Asian trade
The global financial crisis has impacted the markets for actions that are falling.
According to Senator évadiez Democrat Harry Reid, legislators are so that Congress could reach a final agreement by Sunday.
They want and calm investors before the start of trade on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could influence the exchange on Monday.
For now, however, it is impossible to say with certainty when both chambers of Congress comes out to vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, the last time, by this or that problem.
Lawmakers are hoping that it will be adopted during the coming days.
However, the law still to see many changes.
The total amount to aid the system needs to be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush, must be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress will have the impression that the programme does not meet its function, it has the opportunity to block the granting of the remaining amount in two stages: First 100 billion dollars more, then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr Bush salua progress in negotiations
Although the president can vetoing the decision, Congress has the opportunity to put it in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the programme, which was to obtain finance to buy bad mortgage securities, whose value Chuta, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to vote for the law, and the Senate on Monday, "made the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush is pleased with progress in negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr Bush was pleased with progress made on Saturday and appreciated the "bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".

Limiting the golden parachutes
The Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of helping against losses, the rebates, the conduct of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also plans to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of companies participating in the programme and it sets up a committee, which will ensure the monitoring of the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked very hard on the issue and have made important progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also includes aid for homeowners, who have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new advance payments for mortgages that it will buy, while reducing payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek psychological assistance.
According to the chief economist of Patria finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but his achievement will be very difficult.
"And that is because we know what will be the mechanism and the price the purchase of assets.
This will be crucial to decide on the share of losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek, this week, ihned.cz server.
If the plan will be taken now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not so important.
"It is much more important than the congressmans agree, this week, they support this plan and they will devote as soon as possible.
This psychological importance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, more important at this time, "emphasized Marek.

A fight to the extreme: MP3 players against the mobile.
You can choose conseillera.
Almost all the Mobile can read the MP3 files, any MP3 player knows telephone.
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Nevertheless there is reason enough to get a reader independent.
The choice is entirely dependent on the use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the home a gramophone expensive high-end to put the new album of Maxim turbulenc.
A music of such products are not on vinyl record, and, in terms of quality, there is no objective reason for that to happen.
If there is in your shelves of records vinyles crammed with the art rock, jazz and blues music, some hope at least likely to have such a gramophone.
Then there is music for the movement, music squeezed, to say a simplified - music on MP3.
There are also categories depending on the price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a reader, the same way as a fan of Pink Floyd would be difficult to sustain the headphones bought for 20 kroner to the market.
These two extremes, from which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of batteries is also crucial
Some music players high-end are capable of much more than a simple reading of music, but it is unknown functions, of course, most of the mobile.
No current apparatus is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the basic functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, it is able to read music and films, registering them, it has a camera quality is variable and can, for example, up to serve.
And if we take into account the smartphones and communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer.
Given that no cold storage does not know burn of meat and no television will take photographs, there is practically a miracle.
But the universality of the mobile is not without flaws.
The number of roles you use is high, as the interval between two rechargements will be reduced.
And the reading of the music is one of the goinfres energy the most important.
There are few mobile phones that are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is significantly lower.
The music players (especially the rudest) are much more efficient.
In the case of mobile cheap, intend to do they play music for a few hours.
If you happen to call time in time, procurez-vous, to be sisters, a second charge for the work - this is true even for the more expensive.
Will should be no problem for MP3 players, which are capable, following a recharging, a continuing operation of at least 9 hours, including the less efficient.
Another problem occurs when the registration of music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the aircraft has a universal USB connector, as not all cannot be directly connected to the computer, without a special software.
We can clearly make music directly on the card memory, but little card readers know go without a reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobile.
As far as readers, you do need, except (iPods), no software.
It is enough to fill, via the USB connector, the apparatus of music from the computer.
Most of the mobile and readers will create a library media classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or even after the judgement of the user.
Some aircraft is showing that an index with a structure of tree, the way of exploring, others are capable of both (iRiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobile phones have more expertise
In the choice of equipment, intéressez-vous especially for life accumulateur, to the ability of memory, the quality and the kind of out of her and, of course, the ease of the contract.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise, and if in the day you are going to listen for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you only need any mobile reading the MP3.
Almost all mobile phones are now able.
You are not even forced to too much attention to music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read.
All come to read the MP3 and the vast majority of music which will get to you will take precisely this format.
It is part of the most prevalent formats and hand him, the vast majority of aircraft is also read music format WMA.
The PCA (format used by the firm Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, buying music online.
It is enough to visit, since the mobile phone, web pages of the operator (or those of another supplier) counterparts and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason to get a mobile music.
The offer of operators is unfortunately wretched and it is limited in most cases of radio tubes fast facts.
Prices are not the lowest.
However, we usually see this way to buy music (either by GSM, or by the Internet, wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people are always wearing their mobiles on itself.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you only have to break the motive in your pocket, so that you forgot your MP3 player at home.
It is also important if you are always on the headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the bodies included, have almost all the Mobile, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three to four thousand kroner, you can have a Walkman already very good.
But in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for headphones.
The price of the best phone and better equipped, also an entry for headphones, no more than fifteen thousand.
The readers, however, have the advantage of having a command easy.
Really, no matter who comes to ensure the commissioning of readers the rudest - which do not necessarily correspond to the less expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command post with a cassette, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet, trendy, by chance, followed by a piece of data transmission.
What a device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile, (e.g. the Vodafone 527) have a memory card slot for tradable (the type M2, microSD, etc).
Even with the purchase by such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kronor.
But be careful.
The basic models do not support in principle that the cards with a maximum capacity of 2 UK.
Only the more expensive fare even with the memory of 8 UK.
If you have a mobile and want to buy an MP3 player cheap, take a Cowon, a creative, a Sony, Samsung, a emgeton, or a iRiver.
According to the max. 2 (UK), you must not spend more than 1 100 kronor.
If you are part of listeners more demanding, choose the mobiles-walkman (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung).
These appliances are filled with touches of commissioning independent for MP3, and the ease of the order is moving closer to that of an MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, which the mobile number Walkman have the same menu user of MP3 players sold separately, is one that went as far in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a capacity of memory (up to 16 UK) and a life of the accumulateur (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is overseen by an MP3 player produced by one of the trademarks mentioned above.

The first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this année-même.
Maybe
The mobile market is relatively late in the Czech Republic, our operators offering virtually the same services that their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, there is still something - a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to reduce prices.
It may be that there will be long.
We have already raised repeatedly on mobil.cz the fact that operators Czechs are among the more expensive in Europe.
The ČtÚ (the Czech office, which indicated that the price of an SMS was higher here than in the rest of the Union, has confirmed.
So, following the latest step to the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation could happen - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of mobile operators Czech cheaper than the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are still so high, compared with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a competition that would really get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we have just three networks, mobile penetration and a far greater than 100%.
Instead, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez.
In this, Pavel dvořák, president of the Council of the Czech office telecommunications (ČtÚ), which has repeatedly said that in the Czech Republic there was more room for another operator, is join operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has apparently not much chance (now, it would hardly of frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has led to a substantial reduction in prices, which were subsequently react to the traditional operators.
However, even before the entry of trouble-fêtes such as Tesco and Virgin Mobile mobile on the market, the voice similar to those that it is now home to was suggested by Britain.
However, it transpired that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go looking too far to find examples.
In February we were informed of the launch, in Poland, the virtual operator mobilking.
In just six months, the operator has managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country.
Add that behind the mobilking, there is the financial group penta-, which owns, among others, the U: FON in tchèquie.
The advantage of virtual operators the ability to concentrate on a target group more specific.
For their operation to be effective, indeed they need far fewer customers that a trader classic.
They are, indeed, without the costs of construction, operation and maintains the mobile network, a relatively high.
That is in the world, the virtual operators are emerging as operators at low cost, they offer appeals and SMS cheap, which is often matched by a range of services limited.
For example Mobile, Tesco, Britain, SMS or at least two times cheaper than its competitors.
However, as shown by the example of mobilking in Poland, focusing on a target group unusual can also be a publicity.
Indeed, the operator is specifically men.
"The real men choose mobilking - an operator who want, and that they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of mobile entertainment company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk at home.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentaire approach, which is based most of the virtual operators.
As it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services. "
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say the mobile operators
However, it still seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, this will not be mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project to success, but in the Czech Republic negotiations are not very promotrices.
The launch of mobilking will rather than in other countries in our area, "said in a phone has to mobil.cz Jana studničková, spokesman for the financial group pentabde.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were at least not support this idea.
Instead, they are trying to do their utmost to a potential competitor may appear.
The group Novera GTS, which would then take a step further in order to become a real competitor to telefonika in the area customers company, does not hide, long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We want very much to be able to offer our clients not only of telecommunications services fixed, but also mobile.
And the sooner the better.
We have already held talks about this possibility on several occasions with all the mobile operators Czechs.
With some, we have managed to make progress in negotiations, "said the group spokesman Pavel kaidl.
The future is perhaps a promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that perhaps we could host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"We do not believe that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific.
For the moment, no issue with a complex project and seriousness in this area has contacted, "said Vlastimil sršeň Department press telefonika O2, in its statement to mobil.cz.
Other operators are also related to the nature of the Czech market.
The spokesman for T-Mobile Martina kemrová says in a rare agreement with the declaration of O2: "We have not recorded for the moment of project viable and bilaterally advantageous, which could be used."
And it adds: "It is virtually impossible that appear in a virtual operator T-Mobile's network by the end of the year.
To operate in a period so limited, we should have now a tangible agreement. "
Vodafone is rather its attention on the performance of the requests for its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said about this: "We are open to negotiations with the virtual operators, and especially in the area of expenses and infrastructure.
This is what we said, means the more contributions from the point of view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is the discovery of a partner for establishing a network for a fast mobile internet. "
The authorities in line with operators.
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry to another operator would mean an increase of competition, would have led to lower prices and falling to their benefit.
What good is to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators can be heard as dodging. The harassment accompanying the creation of the U: FON witness also.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČtÚ, the creation of the U: FON, has been that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
Witness the publicly available information drawn from the Web pages of the ČtÚ.
Today, however, the U: FON is ready to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina kemrová noticed on this subject: "The competition on the mobile market has been, most recently exacerbated by market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of a player would cause further, and especially its services to high standards. "
But given the attitude of the mobile operators that are, the indifference of the regulatory agencies Czechs seems strange.
It is not just the attitude of the ČtÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has not, alas, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition.
It is exclusively to the Office for the protection of economic competition (Úohs).
However, he embraced, faced with this problem, its position is typical.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question about renting the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement was reached for the moment, because the supply of interested potential originally had not made enough interest to the traditional operators, "said in response to our question kristián chalupa of external relations department of Úohs.
A statement and does not surprendrait from representatives of operators.
But from an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and between other also take care, that no-one will take its position on the market, such a statement is baffling.
As kristián chalupa adds: "abroad, where the virtual operators are normally here, we can see that their entry into the market has helped to lower prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the direction of a functioning honest on the market and to lower prices is apparently not part of the interests of Úohs.
What is really shocking is the tallies almost touching the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, whether it is really a chance, there is of course.
Similarly, a price of petrol strictly equal to all the service is deciding due to chance and the battle of the competition.
"The office did not take up of signs of a anticompétitif behaviour, it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators of a dominant position, none was therefore a corresponding responsibility of his behaviour on the market.
The tools necessary for the opening of the mobile market in the virtual operators are probably even in the telecommunications regulator, "said in its statement chaloupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drafted by the ČtÚ that telecommunications are, in terms of economic competition, a single market.
None of the operators Czech Republic has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some experts of the right offer a different view: for the creation of a virtual operator is possible, it must get each time the consent of the operator of network.
And the mobile operator has fairly logically the monopoly on its network.
It is necessarily a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
But even without acknowledging this argument, it should be at least worrying for the Úohs three mobile operators are clearly in a similar.
However, complaints of many people (including the society Novera GTS, already mentioned) show that they are in negotiations with all the operators of similar constraints.
To place responsibility on the ČtÚ is a fairly common in communications, through which the Úohs is washing his hands.
We have already seen this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
It has not managed to get in the novélisation of the law on telecommunications, recently adopted an enlargement of the powers of the ČtÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement.
This, the representatives of the Úohs must know, but their interests are apparently.
When nobody watches, it can walk
That said, the operation of a kind of virtual operators shortfalls, several mobile networks in the Czech, remain undetected.
It is business publishing their own list price of mobile phone services, but these are public, in part.
In most cases, it is a matter of firms handling of the multi-level marketing.
The mobile telephone services particularisés are being proposed by Amway Bohemia, telecom, starlife and others.
The list price of these firms are generally only to members.
The magic wand is the fact that the company made before the operator of a client company Classic, which commands a large quantity of SIM cards.
As a client, she gets the price (and other special).
The problem is that business conditions of all mobile operators Czech prohibit such a resale.
"If it happened what you suggest, it could be a breach of contract terms that we examine and which could lead to a halt in cooperation with the company in question," answered the question on this issue kemrová Martina.
However, it is rather unlikely that an echo of such activity was not able to responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No one with operator, however, opposes such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms are non-négligeables their profits, and in opposition to the virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own marketing official.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used as a percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not recorded in their name, so they cannot be fully in the manner of customers' normal 'mobile operators.
This is precisely which would seem strange to ČtÚ.
Moreover, there is another question to the Úohs.
If the mobile operators are turning a blind eye on such a procedure, why are blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
He added that the Úohs has fairly broad powers to disclose such activity, and if it does not want to settle the explanations of operators, who said they had no idea that this would happen, their contractual terms and conditions the ban.
When we will not be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has made a significant loss of the price of services.
However, almost in every country where appeared of virtual operators, the traditional operators were an attempt, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by these were almost the same - a market too little, if not too crowded, problems with the quality of services, etc.
This is precisely at this level that have occurred in the developed countries, regulators, who had not the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their clients.
As well by formal action by an informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, regulators Czechs treat this issue in the manner of a hot potato disposed of in the passing of a target near.
Following the experiences that we have, we cannot shake the impression that the confusion in the skills in this case more than good.
But do not throw give up so easily.
If the information to the scenes true and a virtual operator will soon be home, the mobile market, the Czech will perhaps movement.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the Úohs will hardly remain impassive face rejection (discrimination) other interested parties.
And we will probably call more expensive than the rest of Europe.

The new anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, during the day of the Czech nationality, the Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem KDE domov můj (where is my homeland?).
The anthem has again been recorded by the Orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of jiří bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a solo singing male or female, an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version.
The call is overseen by kateřina kněžínková and Adam plachetka.
Otakar jeremiáš and Jaroslav krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the ihned.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national singing as one of the finest anthems.
As it had already left before the Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he has chosen for interpretation of the versions solo singers with the young and representative, which are marked and appreciated.
"Since the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers and chorus, have a good walking, so that they understood the words, they sing to simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will next year, his 175è anniversary.
The call KDE domov můj retentit for the first time in 1834 on the planks of stavovské Divadlo (the scene of the member) in fidlovačka (kermesse of savetiers), original Czech Josef kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music františek Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously.
After the creation of the tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first breath became an integral part of the national anthem.
It demeura one of seven national symbols, even after the creation of the Czech Republic independent.

The transport (mhd) pragois introduce, Wednesday, the chip in their system of ticketing
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be included in the history of pražský dopravní podnik (the agency pragoise transport) as the date on which will set up in the metro and trams and buses, the first passenger, who, instead of having a ticket on paper, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At this time, it is accessible for nearly a hundred thousand people, owners of the smart card opencard.
Passengers can buy a coupon for 30 days or 90 days (it will apply from 1 January 2009) and the time to register on their smart card information points and the offices of the dopravní podnik (the agency Transport), located in the underground stations muzeum, můstek, nádraží holešovice, anděl, roztyly, letňany, kobylisy, rajská zahrada, kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the opportunity to buy the voucher via the Internet on Web pages of the dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people profitèrent service during the morning.
Those who will begin to use the shop online can forget all the counters in the underground stations, where they had until now speak to in long lines in order to get tickets in paper.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon via the Internet and we will see on their card opencard in one of the 13 městská knihovna (municipal library).
"In these points of contact, there are available to passengers a one-stop shop with a trained staff, which will help them with the purchase by the Internet and predict the coupon that they purchased on their card," said spokesman Martin opatrný project.
In addition to the library, it will also be possible to register the electronic voucher on the opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule several underground stations.
What are these machines?
They are red, reminiscent of the machines to compost tickets and passengers have perhaps already noticed in the underground stations roztyly, budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, florenc and vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should have 80," added opatrný.
An automaton will monitor the coupon on the driver
The vending machines that will operate from tomorrow, are easy to use.
It is enough to introduce the smart card opencard and the coupon bought earlier will make himself on the map.
The electronic voucher is valid from tomorrow, not only in the capital, but also around the town.
The périurbains trains and buses 300 to 499, that are essentially the inhabitants of Commons bohemian central to access the capital.
"In the trains involved in pražská integrovaná doprava (Transport Integrated Prague), the supervisors are equipped with card readers, in which they set the validity of temporary and zoning voucher," explained the control of the notes Filip drápal ropid organisation, which sees the hours of public transport pragois.
Buses are equipped with périurbains card readers to a driver.
When boarding it is necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but it must also put the opencard to the right place on the side of the fund.
The driver control the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger would need to check the validity of the voucher registered, there is nothing more simple request this information to the driver," compléta drápal.
Passengers who are not taking the bus périurbains and do not remember the date when it expires the validity of their coupon can join new vending machines, originally used to record the voucher on the map.
This is, on the screen of the plane, which will display the information on the validity of their document.

The Sudeten demanding a referendum in the U.S.
The Sudeten Germans were in 1945 that Šumava is included in the United States.
It stems from a letter filed in the collections of the jihočeská vědecká knihovna (the library of scientific Bohemia in the South).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans are turning supposedly in the US president with such a desire.
This is between a letter preserved in a private archive, which has now lodged in the collections of the jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
The Germans of Český Krumlov praying in the letter the US president not to allow "šumavská župa '(area of forest in southern Bohemia) - It was annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - was in Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops are on the German territory not oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "people, the fate of the Šumava take to heart."
Given that the rallying to Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising, knowing the Czech National - that of brutality, attitude regardless, lack of understanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter calling on the American president to take in its hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe, that you would give it to a state, alien to us, that oppresses and destroyed the minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the allies without taking account of the opinion of the quarter million people," is written in the letter.
The reason would-be for which the authors may not sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge "oppressors Czechs."
If the US president doubted the opinion of Šumava Germans, it would have to hold, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish if its people wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text content in the letter can, given the current knowledge of history of post-war seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of Sudeten Germans.
While the Germans Czechs were at least suggests that the issue of their expulsion from the Republic will be very few of them are avouaient such a possibility.
Some promised that America and Britain would get for the Sudeten some sort of autonomy.
Others believed that they would simply in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav chalupa, born in České budějovice confirms this.
During the war, it was, as a German of České budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the camp to capture of the region the Holstein, dozens of Germans Czechs were consulted for what they learn the Czech.
"They believed that once they return home, the Czech their would be beneficial," said chalupa.
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war was, according to him that, following the beneš decrees, it would be expelled from the Republic.

It should discourage the drivers of the conduct quick and drink-driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It is primarily designed to reach the conscience of young drivers, motorcycle, pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Above all the personal stories that are going to attack the emotions.
It also shows the slogan "bloody" throughout the campaign.
You do not consider - you paies!
The phrase "You do not consider" is included in majuscules on the registration plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "You paieras."
What needs to symbolize that we can pay for life for a moment of insufficient attention.
The spots will "haunting" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see commonly images with drastic images of victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to lower the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on roads in the Czech Republic.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
The strategy of sugar and the hard against the drivers
"What works with drivers, it is the system of sugar and hard.
For them, the sugar is represented by, for example, to save time, when they grillent a red light.
The Whip, is the threat of fines or an accident.
The risks should be reminded drivers, "said Martin kořán, the psychologist transport to hospital na homolce.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and negative advertisements, believes the psychologist.
The signs pointing out the danger to the drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static panel, which warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers do the will see more," signala kořán.

Ehud Olmert, president of the provisional government in Israel, has ruled in favour of the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He made that statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (involved), and all," said Olmert daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not happen," he added.
The deal that the return as possible, including East Jerusalem.

Issues that arise after the accident: The cabin in because they are illegal immigrants?
The law is ignoring them; walk in a long distance is forbidden.
In the context of the tragic accident of the coach of society student agency near Padua, Italy, created the question if the cabin and passengers can during the journey to move inside the bus.
"If you wanted to respect the law strictly and formal, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on the road," said the spokesman of the Department of Transportation Karel hanzelka.
The accident, during which has killed a hôtesse aged 22 years, was apparently caused by the driver of a lorry which has come across the road to the coach.
The girl was at this time, unfortunately, seated next to the driver, on the seat the most dangerous of the vehicle, although it has available to her other two seats.
But the coach can have an accident or slow down a steep, also at a time where the steward serves the coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is if the coach is under its technical fitted sheet of places up or not.
If this equipment for places standing is not approved, passengers must sit.
Coaches long distance student agency does not have seats up; that was confirmed in aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim jančura.
"It is an issue that we have dealt with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of the passengers.
Then they have cancelled and we have achieved that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey on condition that they have their own seat, "he unveiled his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of Steward, a legal prescription is involved in this role.
Moreover, no legal requirement does not prohibit the carrier to offer services.
The law on the road transport is just the term recipient of vehicle; it does not define its rights and duties, "adds more ambiguity, the spokesman hanzelka.
Josef pokorný, the director of the Department of the movement of road vehicles, believes that the law treats enough.
"It all depends on the fact if the coach was in his approval granted permission to offer places.
All lies in this, "he says.
Coaches are divided into town, where there are seats and a maximum speed is limited, inter-urban with seats and a speed allowed more high and long distance coach without place standing with the maximum speed and highest seats fitted with seat belts.
As in the plane, said an expert
Jaroslav hořín, an expert at besip (security) of road safety in transport, does not see the movement of cabin on board as a major problem.
"At a movement, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
But it is not sure when will be a hôtesse turbulence and the air can beat your head. "
"However, in case the coach would have slowed down a steep, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way in a city bus or in a tram.
The carrier needs to manage the safety of cabin by internal requirements, "he says, and also believes that the point of view of the law, the problem is not settled.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student agency is the only carrier coach to offer the services of cabin.
It takes two hundred.
Even after this incident, the director does not consider their profession as a profession.
"However, once I have the impression that it is a profession, I supprimerai.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding.
It would reduce the cost, "he says.
Security concerns is the reason that gives the absence of cabin in its vehicles, the director of the Asiana Alexei litvine, which in comparison with her, a very small number of lines.
"We have no receptionists. We are opposed to it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident, "he said, there is a years, týden.cz.
A great tragedy came
A young hôtesse region plzeň, who worked for the company for two years ago, has died at the accident on the line of Naples.
A lorry Slovenian probably quité the hard shoulder without using clignotant and it has blocked the path to the coach.
The driver to try to avoid using an abrupt, but he came by his right side.
Jančura denies that the two seats reserved for the rest of the cabin were sold.
"In the case of long distance, it is not possible to treat these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the lorry.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait the judgment of the court, but as regards financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
Changing the law?
Not so
Changing the law, which is being drafted, for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the ministry of transport, could provide details about the movement of cabin aboard the bus.
"However, it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
Indeed, it is not interested too buses, but rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phone at the wheel, "said the hořín expert.
"The transport ministry does not consider the activity of the cabin as something that would basically endangering the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesman hanzelka, stating that the safety monitoring coaches is under the power of the police and the Office for safety at work.

The hopes of düsseldorfois based in Frankfurt.
The big words have plenty in the letter by the steering committee of WestLB to employees of the home.
In a Union of entities from the Institute of Düsseldorf with the deka-bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be, according to the letter made public Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "block of competence" doubled in a sustainable productivity in such a case.
After all, such a relationship could be the decisive to other concentrations in the banking land.
That is what it looks like when a committee board is keen to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is still strong pressure.
This is not only the European Commission, but also the federal authority to monitor the financial services, which it only recently, made clear the government of the land of rhenanie of nord-westfalie that time was running out in search of a future solution.
But it is a matter for some time ago - on the side of Frankfurt - a relationship of any kind between the bank Deka, which is the customers of the Sparkasse through their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the deta-bank Franz WAAS announced at the presentation of the figures of six months in late August that he had no sense in the merger of the House of the Mainzer landstrasse with a bank of land, whether the Helaba or WestLB.
However the board of the DEKA which each half is borne by the banks land and by the groups of savings banks, has instructed the steering committee to conduct talks with the WestLB, for commercial activities.
It might be the flow of financial market, or parts of it.
The talks come, however, only to start, told the financial centre.
This is not the first time that the deta-bank, with its 3,000 employees, account for one of the largest employers on the city of Frankfurt, comes in when there is talk of consolidation in the sector of the coffers of savings.
In 2003 it was believed for a moment that the deta-bank could merge with the Bank of land and the halbab Rhineland Palatinate.
Nothing has yet emerged this ternaire mix.
À death the plans had they been made public that the government of the land of Hesse said it was against any participation in the hellaba in them.
Subsequently, the other two houses no longer does not rejoignèrent.
The Bank of the land of Rhineland Palatinate was joined at the bank of the land of bade-wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there was always new negotiations on the reunification of the deka-bank with banks to land.
Finally, Günther Merl, president of the steering committee of the hellaba, however, was made against any commercial strategy to merge with its bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to spread that the amalgamation of different schools of public sector is especially urgent.
Now that the election to parliament of the land of Bavaria is gone, a union of BayernLB with the bank of the land of bade-wuttenberg could be put first.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that requires new mergers should increase the potential partners, he released gradually.
In the South, it is now a junior partner, although it has so far better withstood the crisis as banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The grouping of savings and transfers of hesse-thuringe, which owns 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba, has instead pushed a barrier at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB.
Would remain at the NordLB.
Such thoughts geo-strategic does, however, that one of the facets.
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can qualify.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question, thanks to what business model the future capacity of banks land should be assured, had not previously resolved by the German Association of savings and loan payments.
Eventually, a carve-up of WestLB, could take place, carve-up which here is not wanted.
It is also what it is in the letter of the Committee executive board in place: In any case, would be referred to a 'global solution is for the establishment.
How this will all be lumped together with the union of certain entities with the deta-bank remains to see.

And so noisy, explains Marco Guarda, this is not for the Italians.
The bus belonged to Marco, who wears a long coat doubled to false fur and pairs of glasses for the broader silver eels.
For five years ago, they go to the celebration of beer, already three virées this year alone.
They go at night, remain the day at the festival, and come at 10.30 p.m..

And it is, it is party to the celebration of beer.
On the Road, somebody is building a yellow caps the trees on the way, the signs and even an election poster of a great party Bavarian.
It is to be ready for the return.

Nights sleep disruption to shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the federal finance minister there is only a few weeks.
What chance that the politician had used the word 'relatively' and that it glissait that the sector banker German would not be spared by the movements of crisis.
It is indeed that occurred this weekend.
The financial, real estate Bavarian Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the DAX, gets a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from turbulence.
A person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the aid commitments are issued to a total of 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the part on what it might as well.
The money comes as many private banks that banks of public law.
In the background, is the société-fille Depfa bears the losses.
The financial state, according to a newspaper article, refinanced at very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is not possible for the fact of distrust of the markets.
In the first half 2008, the reserve of liquidity to the bank had been reduced by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, the rate of capital also was slightly to 1,45 declined by 1.6 percent.
The benefits and those net from financial transactions were compared with the same period last year, dropped to zero, the benefits from the allocation of debt and securities firm and the termination of provisions in the operations of credit had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
And it is only due to large profits from reimbursement of costs of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as interest payments, according to the Book of fiscal procedures and purchases for companies to konzern that the deficit of the gains of about 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former financial state had initially poorly speculated on the Appropriations industrial estate, which then had been filialisés at the bank Aareal.
Because the financing of state classic was not enough profitable, the Depfa was then committed more intensively in the infrastructure projects and in funding for projects in common between private investors and État (privat-public-partnership, PPP) and diverse internationally.
On the value of the société-fille, Hypo Real Estate needs of depreciation, which should have on the calculation of gains and losses of the group as an essential material that remains unclear.
The fact is that dividends have been cut.
Already, in 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the takeover of the Depfa, an investor of state and infrastructure is extremely important.
It is more robust than other institutes dependent on the refinancing on the market inter-bancaire because it has no deposit of customers.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the allocation of funds between banks has again expressed constant considerably, banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion - all the resources of the Depfa, a way for short-term refinancing.
According to release the Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding the group is covered with the credit in the medium term and the company protected the influence of international financial markets largely out of work now.
Other sources say that the refinancing would be assured the funds until the end of 2009.
The president of the committee board of HRE Georg Funke explained that the group Hypo Real Estate should not have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Établissement for the supervision of financial services (BaFin) assume that the ability of Hypo Real on the market is now assured.
Shareholders and creditors of the bank no longer than hoped.
However, given the momentum and the impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty.
This is not unthinkable that it should not use the funding in full.
But the opposite will not be dismissed.
After the fact that the bank is the latest releases, yet the gates of insolvency Sunday at the end of evening, rescue packages for the least temporary will not be able to reassure the minds either.
The share price has fallen by 75% to EUR 3.30 goes.
The bonds, however, are particularly well.
While the debts in the first head have barely budged, loans to sideline flagging.
The most affected are especially investment funds from the former société-fille Württemberg Hypo and those of course that have a life beyond 2009.
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate appeared before a speculative investment alternative, now their value should be seen as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute who has brought the crisis in the establishment by the takeover of the bank Depfa.
As the institutes, governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, we can assume a reduction of arrears in time.
Or will that no one would hope at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the 15 months.
But the noise renouvellés a partial nationalisation, the likelihood that approached the sureté has now become a mere hope based.
This should give nights sleep disruption before all the creditors in the long term on the decision of whether they should secede from their commitments.
Investors in the short term can still use what they have drawn a line for a postponement of losses for the coming years on the next tax on incomes of capital stock market gains automatically deducted.

Sylvana and the secrets of the boite to Bento
When Sylvana hiltrop, 16 years ago, must be present for the first day in highschool of Tachibana, girls are beginning to Pouffer laugh: The German is so "Kawaii '!
What it means?
Sylvana is already the word through the Mangas - in his new log exchanges, it speaks of Japan.
"The first day of course in Japan.
What I was excitée.
Already the way to go to school I was afraid.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train up to 40 minutes of Tachibana highschool.
I find the road alone, fortunately I am not lost.
The start of the courts do not seem to be set so strict that home in Lower Saxony.
Pupils are after another from eight hours, until at least nine hours, 20, a round table discussion begins with the teacher, the 'home room ".
But before it begins, it was for me to stand.
I am not the kind of love to talk to people, particularly in a class of 40 pupils.
As I had not yet the uniform of school, I have put an old skirt of my mother, and a rising blue shirt, socks and black leather shoes.
In this place so I am presented to the chair, and tried to speak properly: She Sylvana sayonara Wo... '- I call Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
À this time, I was very pleased to have begun to learn the language there two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have all been whispering, pouffé laugh and signs, and I constantly hear the word "Kawaii."
I already knew, thanks to my Mangas.
It is the vocabulary is essential to the survival of experienced Japanese and means "beautiful, cabbage."
Then I am soon crept in my place.
The girl next to me made me a great smile ironic, it felt that it was an honour that the corresponding to sit next to it.
The rest of the time has been relatively calm, but when the gong was music, I have been beset with the rules.
Everyone was at best, pouffait laugh and I did a lot of questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand the Japanese English.
During the break, they have all come out their Bento.
My mother reception had also made this kind of lunchbox - it really is something other than the miserable snacks Germans.
I had Rice aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and a kind of meat, surrounded by tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a bizarre appearance and a completely new.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except perhaps plums salt confites, Brrrr!
The Bentos are not only of lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a bento she has prepared itself, and who is prepared very carefully - in the hope to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I have read it in my Mangas.
I am curious to know if I could see this as well here.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked me my friends when I have told me that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I have always responded.
"Because it fascinates me, what '
Ultimately, read Mangas, this is what I prefer already for years.
And, in order to better understand the Mangas and culture, at a time, I have also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was very clear that I had to be travelling on a day.
Because I was too low for the traditions, the customs and traditions.
And here, it gives them a lot of importance.
On one side, Japan is the country of technologies and the latest trends – it is tough, disciplined and traditional.
And like everything is so well organised, I never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen. "

Rats are also sensations
A rat or a cafard fled before the danger, est-ce-que it means that it feels as fear?
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have also sensations.
But how we can check that it feels the same thing when he behaves the way that we?
In the magazine online "edge" of the contributions are published for several years by famous scientists.
Spiegel Online in a series of articles answers the question "What do you be true without proof?"
I believe that the animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else has until now could prove just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, there can at least hope that all the human brain are the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species, and that we address the issues of felt or in general consciousness, we are moving into the difficult terrain, because the hardware is not.
When a rat is in danger, it did the same thing that many other animals: it is the death, fled or attack.
The human beings behave the same way, this is why some scientists deduce a subjective comparable.
However, I do not believe in it.
Two aspects of brain structure makes the implementation of our subjective experience to that of animals.
One aspect is that the circuits involved almost always human conscience include the prefrontal cortex (the wing of its participation in the short-term memory and in senior management and delivery).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than among other primates and seems to be entirely absent from other people.
At least for these aspects-ci our conscience who depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the conscience of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide it is reasonable to suppose that human beings differentiates itself from other primates.
Another significant feature might lie in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of its existence is linked to language, it often means that his conscience depends on it.
In this case, it could exclude the animals.
But even if the conscience should not depend on the language, it would have full influence over the course, so that the animal awareness, regardless of how it is produced, différencierait probably a lot of most of our member of conscience.
It is difficult to determine what may look like the awareness among other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not measure and the fact of this hardware particular analysis based on our own experience, then his observation we have big problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the experienced aware, but there is next to another aspect of the awareness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
It could examine the process of awareness of the animals without taking account of their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the memory of primates, particularly with the example of the display.
But in this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it focuses more on the correlations nerve fibres, aware that on the mechanisms triggers: the two may be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the display.
But what does he oil then for the emotions?
I conclude that a system emotional such as fear is activated in the brain aware of its own activity.
What we call as "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its follow-up, as the reactions of the body) absorbs the memory alive.
As well observed, the emotions are closely linked to regions of the cortex that characterise the primates and humans.
Of the subtle degrees was associated with our nature volubile, have been identified, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorising the member for the blame to others.
À contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, think the sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the bodily sensations of the brain cortex and the waistline, as pankseep Jaak which, however, focuses more on the waistline brain.
As this network is not much changed during human development, it could actually participated in any kind of across-the-board sensations.
In purely theoretical, I do not contradict him, but I believe this indémontrable.
Pankseep argument is that what is as fear among men and in rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: How are yet to check if rats and men feel the same when they behave alike?
A cafard fled before the danger, but if he felt fear?
À my eyes, similar are not enough to prove the experienced the same.
Although the comparison nervous help: rats and humans have troncs brain similar, the cafards however do not possess even a brain.
But est-ce-que the waistline brain is behind the sensations?
And even if we could prove that for the rights: how the show in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who knows?) have sensations.
But I do not know how the show.
And because their sensations to Mark probably completely ours (since the human consciousness is based on special circuits and the language), I prefer to explore the behaviour emotional sensations emotional rats.
In all cases, progress poignent nervous on the plan as it gauges the same thing in rats and humans.
As I is not exploring the language and awareness in rats, or the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
We could see this as the short term, but I prefer to go forward rather than bumping into things constantly against a wall.
I am a émotionel pragmatic.

The trend was clear, especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers were paid by 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this résideraient for American Express in the weak dollar which has led to a 'desire to travel down the American tourists ".
The financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by the decline in prices of hotels that industrial sites in Hanover, Cologne and Stavanger.

Domestic flights in Germany have even been halved in this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be a side fléchissante economic growth, explains the firm.
The request cèderait ground in a market segment of travel by plane.
Another side, there is pressure increased competition in the Open Skies treaty that liberalises air traffic between the États-unis and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the removal by the airlines non-rentables journeys, as well as the high number of airlines that would have presented the results during the first half 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone.

HSV fighting Gladbach 0 1.
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first.
In the Borussia, Luhukay still has not managed to find an eleven functional.
To Kristoffer Klein. Grow. Landing in disaster for international player Marko Marin.
The player of Gladbach does not rentra that late in the game and lifted his shot fell against the framework.

The practice has failed.

Bastian Reinhard would "also wanted to be more relaxed."
The 1: 0 (1: 0 at half-time), the team of Hamburg due to a strike of the head by Mladen Petric successful (at the eleventh minute); and the fact that very low Gladbach players could not do any harm to the small players in Hamburg.
"Ça was a dirty victory," Marine was Jol.

The team with its entrants late committed - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the guardian of aim Petric as Jansen débauché of FC Bayern - are true, but it was not yet.

The dark influence on the flight of the space sondes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon gives researchers in the confusion: the dark influence on the speed of space sondes during what is called the moves to support gravitationnel.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely accurate.
For almost 18 years ago the Sunda space "Ulysses" flies in the area.
The fact of conductions fuel soon set aside, the death cryogène the threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is causing confusion among researchers - the anomaly of the support gravitationnel.
The support gravitationnel is a ploy of sondes space, by which they get an extra boost in the field gravitationnel a celestial body, the Earth, for example.
Thus, the sondes can save a lot of fuel.
The Sunda of research américo-européenne Cassini-Huygens used this trick, as The Ulysses solar borehole.
This is what surprised researchers elsewhere for years: the volants objects are not always 100 percent of how it expects the venerable laws of gravity.
Much more, irregularities appearing at the speed.
The sondes become so unexpected faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this.
They referred to as the anomaly of the support gravitationnel.
Some experts fear that the theory of relativity general Albert Einstein, who described the strength of the attraction of the area because of the curvature of the area, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still hard as iron that Einstein did was wrong and is trying to explain the anomaly of the support gravitationnel using the so-called black matters that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The Black might be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth," he writes.
The researchers in the area know about the black only for about ten years.
It is apparently it an attractive prospect whose effect is seen on other bodies.
It is completely invisible, meaning that it sends out and do not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any light visible.
According to calculations of scientists, the black would be just a fifth of the mass of the universe.

The British companies in the building may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect deposits of 2.6 million savers of Bradford &amp; bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from investors, including 59 societies of the building.
The director general of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said he is "irritating" that companies and their states will have to foot the bill...
The loan of £14 billion will be repaid when mortgages of Bradford &amp; bingleys are released.
But the interests that will also increase, will be débités each year to 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The financial services compensation scheme has confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 companies the building are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that the institutions that have taken a cautious … must now pay some bills institutions that were much less conservative.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It says that each company must pay an amount proportionate to the deposits that it holds, and that companies must pay intermediaries about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will be in 2009, at £450millions.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the committee commercial companies of the building, told the BBC that this decision he seemed unfair.
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions that have taken a cautious behaviour at the resumption of the housing market, must now pay for the institutions, much less conservative.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since 1945, the first record.
"We need to examine all aspects of this matter for the coming weeks to assess the options to avoid building societies and their members are paying this bill balloon," said Mr Cole.
The interests for 2009 include seven months to end September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, it will pay interest on the whole year, which could also double.
Given that the building societies are organizations without shareholder, their members end up paying the bill by the burden is higher or lower interest rates for savings accounts.

New study in the case prosecutors Americans.
The attorney general has appointed a special accuser to check the question of the dismissal of nine prosecutors Americans in 2006.
It is born of the reporting of the inspector general of the Department of Justice, who criticised the actions of some officers cabinet.
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The survey is based on the theory of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is to political causes.
The accuser, Nora Dannehy takes place now whether the officers interviewed during the inquiry, lied to investigators, obstruant and justice.
"serious accusations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed nor resolved," said the inspector general Glenn Fine, in his report.
The appointment of a special accusing able to compel witnesses to table, was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute started by the radiation in December 2006 of nine prosecutors Americans made by the Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had said that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor performance.
But it emerged later that prosecutors dismissed were not more criticism that their colleagues, which prompted some observers to give these redundancies, a political connotation.
Some prosecutors have been accused of being close to the Republicans in Congress, while others have refused to investigate the allegations of fraudulent vote against the Democrats.
American prosecutors investigate and continue the courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be made redundant at any time, but can only be for political reasons.
The head of Department of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, is accused of being involved in this case of dismissal, and at the end, he resigned.
A number of Cabinet officers, the Department of Justice have also given their resignation.
The report of the inspector general was very critical of the role of Mr Gonzales in this case, saying it was "primarily responsible" for these redundancies, and eventually "abdicate" its leading role, "managing remarkably not involved in this case.
Other cabinet officers, including former collaborator of Bush, Karl Rove, have been criticised for not having failed to cooperate during the investigation.

A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and can be soon be on sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others merely functional.
And even some taxis veterans and local residents of a long time are providing information to go to extra place, because they have never heard.
The street is in the East Village and wanders the north of first street- not to be confused with second street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it resembles a poussiéreuse rather than a lifeline.
And some signs indicate the streets.
It is virtually impossible to find on a standard Atlas.
This Street, however, fans.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent buildings of luxury on First Street.
It would repaver extra place, and create a more fluid into the shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including the neighbours, have said to be happy with this shortened simply because there is one of the last and oldest streets of the houses.
But the Department of Conservation and Development properties of the city that manages the Street, has no interest in the bear.
This month, at a meeting of the committees of owners of neighbourhood, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have outlined a proposal authorizing the manufacturer property to buy the streets.
But the committee would prefer that the street in the hands of the city, and asked a new proposal to make next month, said Susan Stetzer, the manager of the committee No. 3.
"It leaves little room belonging to the city, and we would like the city retains extra place," she said.
"They could offer to rehabilitate and manage it, which also Avalon could do, but we want to maintain public."
Avalon Bay announced months ago she wanted to repaver small streets and installing seats, some are also used by a coffee that the manufacturer will lend money space.
The proposal this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele of Milly, the door floor of Avalon Bay, said that although the company intends to exploit the street, this does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is relooker this been abandoned, and make it public," she said, stressing that this was the city to suggest the sale ".
Seth Donlin, a door floor of the preservation of real estate, has confirmed that the city wanted to sell Well Street, stressing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than the handle.
Compared to its neighbour, more colourful, Bowery, extra place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that extra room bears the name since 1802, when the legacy of the big firm to the many children of Philip minthorne was split, leaving aside this small, who since abandoned.
The entry after the CBGB monument, a punk rock closed in 2006, will open to extra place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo in coverage of the album of Ramones' 'to Russia. "
"This place was magnificent," said Danny you think, the manager of Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
It was full of scrap yard, haillons, barrels, posters, leaves and strings. "
Some residents, including the bloggeurs who had already talked about the evolution of the luxury of the East Village, have opposed the idea to sell extra place, saying that this humble small property should be public.
Others have announced extra place as a true rareté- a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be done in peace.
Named Jeremiah Moss, who led a blog called jeremiah' is vanishing New York (subtitled "The book the protests: A look deeply nostalgic about a town in the process of extinction") described the history of the city and extra space, published in 1952 in the New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "extra place is a small cul-de-sac, narrow, dark day and night, and marked by the doors of a warehouse in rouillé and persiennes, full of newspapers last week which are soaring along the gouttières."
With few exceptions, the street has always the same pace.
A short agilement rat on the back alley, almost a door that was once the CBGB, and which has now become the headquarters of a clothing store chics.
The graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer to 22 onces vacuum, is part of newspapers that have just to be cast.
A few passers-by said they did not think that rarely to contractors, and suggested its value.
Mr Field, for his part, said that some under believed the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he declared, "took place in the dark, wet and disgusting".

The debate bilingual left in the English language.
In this part of the programme of supervision of education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidates about the bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of studies in California, and former director of the Department of Education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you thought: why the middle classes should be able to choose their school."
The favour of Hispanic voters is a business complex.
The proposals of Barack Obama on education are an interesting example.
The campaign of Mr Obama points out that "African-American is Latino students and have less chance of diplômer that students are white." It is true.
To combat these differences, the education programme of Mr Obama supports, especially among many other subjects, "the bilingual education efforts" to those who learn English.
But the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education, which defends the instruction in class in languages other than English, goes beyond its interest to eliminate the differences.
For example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school east of Los Angeles Conté.
The students this school are largely Hispanic, and low income.
More than one-third of students, set up many new arrivals, studying English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% have spent the review of maths in 2008, an expert.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have spent the examination of anglais-de langues-d' arts
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient that made by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street on analyses, the practice, a constant assessment skills as well as an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr Obama could copy, reported Linda Mikels, most of the Sixth Street, this school has introduced the education of the English language "full waterboarding."
The full waterboarding in English, focusing on the almost constant use of English in the investigation.
Ms Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education, has declared "we have had a tremendous success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after that, if you go without his class, you would have had no chance to identify."
"This way, she observed," it worked for us. "
Mr Obama should not take example of the Sixth Street Prep and respond in other schools composed mainly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by the school speak for themselves, but the policies on education within his party (the associations for the national education, support for a bilingual education) and his huge support for bilingual education, began the predicts the response from Mr Obama.
Although it is in favour immigrants learn English, Mr Obama has recently seen this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we all need to stop arguing about the wording of the laws in the English language.
"Instead, he said, 'You must ensure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, there would then consider carefully, the models of education that work, rather than dismiss or as insignificant.

The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals have salement played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre has managed to make a place to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown from 12 yards, precursor to an afternoon in which their relationship has made a leap forward.

Gebrselassie rested, beyond his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopia, has once again proved to be worthy of his best long-distance athlete of the century, having beaten his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, became the first run 26,2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes.
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 in a race to be compliant on the flat, Gebrselassie defeated 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, played last year in Berlin.
For 35 years, Gebrselassie won the 26ème world record of his successful career during which he won the World Cup or the world record for any distance, the 1600mètres marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, craignant- may be under the eyes of today, that air pollution is increasing its problems of asthma.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost parfaites- time sunny, 48 degrees at the start, 55 to the arrivée- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive for a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The runners to runway as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, all two Kenyans, converted to runners, contributed to the reduction of the record of the marathon of more than two minutes in the past ten years since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa became in Berlin in 2: 06: 05.
After the victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the reporters have suffered the crampes Mollet two weeks before, and having missed training for a week.
It is clear that the rest him has been brilliant, but not rouillé.
"I am so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I am called last week and today, I had my doubts, but at the end it all went for the better. "
It was reproché- especially in Kenya, the rival is in the ethiopie- for having too much to orchestrate his races, avoiding the stars of the marathon world, relying on the hares as if they were in a competition of runway, and considering the more world records that the sense of competition.
But this criticism is not diminishing the grandeur of the capabilities of Gebrselassie as a runner.
On Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. during road.
Two runners to elite Kenyans, James Kwambai and Charles kamathi continued to defy Gebrselassie after the head of queue have disappeared.
A little more than three miles of the arrival, Gebrselassie made his final push to diversify away from Kwambai, which ends up second in 2: 05: 36, improving her personal best record of five minutes.
Kamathis is coming third in 2: 07: 48.

The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25.

It could participate in the Beijing Games because of potential harm to the back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving its third marathon, his record of almost five minutes.
It courut making use of a clever strategy, leaving the group of runners in Ethiopia and Kenya's take a great advantage, the more then around 18miles ½ after.

In a city in hand, pride and the hardships of life black
Hidden in the development of its Great Park, with a few miles of the sunny, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a quiet town, where are the pride and the complications of the African-American experience.
"Eatonville, first city to integrate fully black, home of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston this description that it did in 1935, is not so simple to do these days." the city in the five lakes, three short of croquet, 300 foncées skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and not in prison ".
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora festival that takes place each year to Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the writer's most famous of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in different ways, the city that it décrit- has become a tourist thanks to its inclusion in the tourist guide to the Florida published by the depression- era federal writers' project- remains a place apart.
It is independent, dignified, and private than it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the rural population in Florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, "we knowing so little, does not know what he loses."
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain wary of the view from abroad.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, resident for ever and the oldest paroissienne of the city.
"It must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It is both a historic model of a takeover of blacks as well as a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of rural culture black sudiste- once scorned, other times acclamée- reminiscent of the birth of slavery in America.
Which explains why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, that everyone here calls Hurston.
It put forward his hometown in the world through books, full of dialect, such as "mules and square ” (1935) and" Their Eyes were Watching God ” (1937).
Five paragraphs in the guide to the Florida transformèrent this city, right on the road, 17, a road that runs through the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which in chapter of history and the human tragedy.
Such a big bold in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers of ownership of the first mayor of Eatonville Mr Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties.
"The Road on the left," écrit-elle, 'you will find a modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and parks game well maintained that Howard Miller has always taken care, although he can barely read and write.
It did in addition to mention the new husband widow dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and everything that can serve the people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston combined Eatonville at an auto government but also to the analphabétisation, remariage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not as well.
This was not actually a portrait that everyone appreciates.
Zora has described the reality, "said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, a young girls Johnson that Hurston has immortalised, citing the songs without colour, interpreted by men who have recognised their beauty."
She added: "Some people do not have appreciated".
I remember always Hurston as a person and eccentric, who frequently after his family has moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, rappela that Hurston arrived in the usual town without warning, on a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and wore trousers here, where even today, it is proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr Franklin said, while many moquaient it.
"People were still happy to see Zora" he said.
But he adds in addition, balançant in his chair of the patio arse which gives sabelia on Lake, where Hurston was certainly entitled, "it was never too long."
The death of Hurston in 1960, it was poor and his books were out of production.
Eatonville and the world seemed to have forgotten.
Although it was once a star of literature, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College years, 20, it was buried in a tomb, with strong Pearce from Fla, where she lived.
To Eatonville, no great celebration, and mark for the public.
I do not believe that they understood the contribution or the legacy that it's the world, "said Valérie Boyd, author of" wrapped In Rainbows ", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
The civil servants of Orange County wants to make a motorway in five channels in town to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, Main Street in two ways of the community.
The development of Orlando has already prompted Interstate 4 until the west of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just a difficult period of history.
A forced integration, among other things, ended the isolation relatively idyllic community.
In the 1950s, the dispute about the mix of races have led the hatred to the community.
"Then, a bunch of young whites came to launch of oranges or objects on the people sitting on the side," said Mr Franklin.
"A woman is dead."
They launched a pastèque their car. "
In a letter from 1955 to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston casts doubt on the request of the Supreme runs to a forced integration, setting out his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifieuse my race."
Residents are now that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, that is positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weaken the confidence of youth.
"The black children were used to be embrassés- I remember we embrace our master for the morning and evening, too," said N.Y. nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as head of safeguarding the community of Eatonville, a group not profit.
It has taken, she added, when teachers and students nor the same place.
"You do not embrasses tone white teacher because it is blanc- I mean that there is here, a line of demarcation cultural," said Ms nathiri.
The civil rights, have helped to create space for many other Zora Neale hurston- black writers, actors and artists who went beyond the damage, as it, armed with a cheerful confidence and guidelines such as: 'How can deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company. "
It is beyond me. "
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the grave of Hurston anonymous and began to fight to revive his reputation.
Five years after, a biography lauded on Hurston carried out by Robert E. Hemenway, a best seller, the réintroduisit and cannons, Americans.
The project of the motorway happened just when the girl's most famous for Eatonville had found its appeal.
And this time the old neighbours of Hurston regard as a sauveuse.
The community has begun to hold a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would create the motorway.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years after, and many are returning in January, to celebrate.
After many years, the contée rejected the proposal of the motorway.
"The fiasco of the motorway to five ways, very fast, a genuine civic pride," said Miss. Nathiri.
Ms Boyd summed up the first declaring that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the project of the motorway has enabled him to change its own image.
Those not residents, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who use our church depuis1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents were beginning to reconsider the past.
Eatonville is classified historic town since 1998.
A library mono subject (name of course Hurston) ouvra in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: six miles of Orlando, it can at any time is seen as a back street after a summer rainy day, small as it was when she was founded by 27 black families in the 1800's.
(Today there are 90 percent of blacks.)
Foreigners who come to discover the story of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
We must ask permission for most of the interviews, and some choses- as the walls of old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating the black men in the Champs- should not be photographed.
Much to Eatonville, as Ms Jones, a teacher courageous and has a low for the red, are still afraid that their island community is understood.
However, given the expansion of the festival Hurston, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
The young in particular, tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considers the entire race: beautiful, and all, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse, crazy and confused that the other racial and ethnic groups in America.
This is the Civic sincere affection we hear the voice of the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, which plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for younger people, as Alondra and Alexia kenon of 11ans, twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description.
"Most people, in this area, will think: 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to other" Alondra kenon said after the Mass on Sunday.
But if you stop and take time to see history is a very beautiful city. "

Here in New York, all speak fluent in finance.

Never before they could not believe that in the offices in glass and nest of bee on top of their tète, bankers and managers of funds to cover that have a New York, are the worst 'working day in office since the fall of 1929.
The livreurs continue to slip on the pavements, with their trolleys and their shelves of muffins for meetings matinières.
The Latin are still in the residential blocks, as mules, a 50 shirts luxurious hung a yoke prepared on his shoulders.
The office continues to be queuing up to buy their sandwich matinier dealers to happen, and it is impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h in week.

Most of those before me, I apprendrais later of Starr, my 'personal banker allowed ", were all queuing up for the same reason for me.
Not the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts of so-called thrifts (such as a society of the building), associations, and the kind of local savings banks and their subsidiaries which only function in a state, and who say they are dealing with customers and their families.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.

The polls and the analysis carried out just after the elections, have defined the extreme right as the most powerful political bloc of countries, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, as anxious about their future in the European Union.

The other, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, in these times, unknown to the public, where we learn to gestures intimate and unseen stolen artists who do not care about playing on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixture into "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people 'the théâtralité some stage with singers, dancers and guitaristes with this side of the lesser known artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the iconography of intoxicating spirit of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the month of the Flemish photograph, the exhibition "reflects the importance of intoxicating spirit of flamenco, more each day," explains the creator, clarifying that "intoxicating spirit of flamenco - people '" can be anything but, having seen the photos, the Observer that they are not the images of artists on stage.
These people photographiées "in the street artists' are able to transmit on stage of the passion, the sadness, joy... in exciting the public.
To capture the moments of personality of these artists should not be photographs on stage.
They have a personality and a unique character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere, which allows me to catch with the camera of moments of personality of the stars of the intoxicating spirit of flamenco. "
With the festival "sing popular mines," Bauer began in 1997 a long trip to photograph the singers, dancers guitaristes or with a camera to mark.
These are portraits, which, thanks to the choice of the camera and equipment, given the photograph classic.
The implementation of various means stylistic breaks with the classic of the image, giving a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of intoxicating spirit of flamenco, according to Bauer: "a very traditional music with roots that is changing and that surprised me every day."
It is not the dance and sing in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who sand filters the public with his art.

Despite these circumstances, such as photographer, I always try that my ideas reality ".

Vargas Llosa confess that the novel that it says is "real courage."
The novel takes place in places that no-one knows and addresses issues unknown, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to move the new project on which it works, a novel whose main character, Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived 20 years in Congo and who went through the Amazon.
The favourite to win the Nobel laureate has confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel, which currently holds "is a real courage" and that "all shows that it should not write it."

"but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure, a fun experience fleeting," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has the effect" and "makes people less similar" because it has asked the writers' not to stoop to the frivolity "and accept their vocation.

"Sangre Mayo," the bet dared to Garci
Based on the stories are talking about our Benito Pérez galdós, José Luis Garci récrée the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre Mayo," which is the most ambitious film of his filmographie with nearly 15 million budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis," he has always admired in the implementation of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of players.
The film for more than two-and-a-half hours, "Sangre Mayo" will make its way out in cinemas on Friday, which will become a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
Big fan of the literature of galdós, José Luis Garci assured of having done with this camera "a dream of child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who was responsible for three years ago, to turn a commemorative film for the two hundred years on 2 May, Madrid, something he has always accepted when the narrative stuck to the historical facts.
The 15 million provided by the municipality of Madrid are for Garci "a unique opportunity" to reproduce with the settings and clothing appropriate the atmosphere of a Spain which has pressed the head for the fight, since the fight for independence has led people to rebellion under the reign of Ferdinand VII, "he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regret not having achieved a funding for the films' Captain Alatriste "or" the ghosts of Goya ’ – more than double that achieved for "Sangre Mayo ’ – as it has not been able to turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio valcárcel, with whom he worked for almost his entire career.
The film "Volver has empezar ’ has influenced its usual way of working on the staging of the players, with which he used to say before starting the camera and that there is no cast, as it seems" humiliating "and believes that" the role of the film is going to theatre and cinema, to be informed. "
Many players in "Sangre Mayo" again before the camera, as Miguel rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times a candidate for the Oscar (he has won a), Garci believes that the three films candidates that represent Spain this year to the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre Mayo," "seven tables of ping pong French" and finally the winner, "the tournesols blind," are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which might be better known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.

The titles of his dances were thinking about the intoxicating spirit of flamenco.
As well, "the dance of the butterfly" reminded me of a popular dance Cuban and "Dance of the snake" to some tangos.
His dancing was sensuelle and they told me that my way of dance was similar to hers, "she says.
The staging is thanks to two outstanding contributions: Miguel Poveda who chantera new Isabela in one of his performances, as he had to "the Puerto Abierta"; and the professor Matilde coral, which has an unusually willing to cooperate with one that was his pupil.
"Matilde tórtola transforms into a mature man.
I am pleased because it has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors. "

"
This work tells, in a way, the life of this woman who has exhibée in places so far, especially for the time, as in India, the États-unis, or in Russia, but also in Europe, since it was usually in London.

America is very fond less without Paul Newman
"The time God creates the perfect people
Paul Newman was part of that. "
This sentence is the actress Sally Field, who has worked with him in 'lack of certain mischievous glee, "and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and the whole of America, with the idea striking that Newman is more of this world.
It was hard to get an Oscar
It is more since 2007.
Everyone knew that he was ill.
It was a blow to everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford began crying, 'my life and my country were better, thanks to its existence ".
No one was afraid to go to ridicule or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and the home died during a particularly dark, where the terrorists and the stock markets are afraid, believes the Americans fell well below, desperately searching for reasons of dignity.
When times are tough and without reason to live, there are human beings that admiration and we need not be Luis Cernuda for love Paul Newman.
It was for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender lost causes and defeated, as the foundation for the fight drugs created in honour of his older brother died following an overdose and the creation of its own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that has been struggling to impose himself against a food culture suicidal.
This wave of admiration balayait expansive Hollywood without paying attention or the nationalities or the passports.
The latest James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, has found that no James Bond died before him.
Another English, the Times Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman has left the summit of his career.
The bad boy arrived in Australia, Russell Crowe, dared name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"It has set the bar high", said George Clooney, which is perhaps the only today trying to penetrate the screen as Paul Newman: being very honnêt and privacy, serious and further goals.
It is not always easy or possible in the jungle media these days.
But there is anyone who tries, and Paul Newman is one example.
After a divorce, it has been married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to which it was true even if the opportunities it plenty not to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my home, if I have a beef in my fridge?", he used to joke.
The sky, it is with pride to the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something which is not so usual in America.
"among all major roles that he interpreted, it has never been so proud that the husband committed, the father in love, the grandfather attentionné and philanthropist," disent-il.

Madrid in the race for the Olympic Games 2016
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can hold the Olympics, after the failure in 2012, it could be in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of the race yesterday: We are not!
They call the race was perfect, but I think it was the worst race in which I have never participated.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, it would be a note éliminatoire.
But look at everything in detail and at the beginning.
The errors are starting with the withdrawal of dossards, which you have to go ahead.
This is not evil, but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the chip to shop).
And no
They did you go there only to take the dossard (first mistake, travel only for it) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was that the size it is for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL).
What are we?
Is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy the shirts of small businesses with fewer fabric and the cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened the day of racing.
The fact that we need to go there very soon to withdraw the chip, the queue is 15 minutes and we must leave his bag to back at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible since 11, 000 people are expected to these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions have started and we had not yet left the bag to back to the entry, although once the withdrawal has been worse.
The rain has accompanied the expectations of more than 40 minutes during which took place rebellion and assault of the barrack.
I believe that about 500 people have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, do not even in the figurerons classification with the exact time, because of the chip that they gave me, I think, did not properly the start.
Of course, if they were asking me to cite one example of race, which I would certainly not the idea.
And I believe we can always dreamed of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games..

Microsoft is seeking a while (virtual).
At the conference on technology Émergentes MIT Microsoft has been presented a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, with little intelligence but able to perform a few basic tasks, such as call a taxi (or in the Microsoft case, a shuttle to move around the campus of the company) in response to what he was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and recognition of forms and faces, "while" can know how many people there are in place, which they are - including remembering what positions they are - and listen and hear the keywords of their conversations.
But the pool in groups of conversation
In the video presentation, while detects a third person, but she understands that it does not belong to the group who is speaking with her and she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and it said that it will respond shortly.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things on which focus, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week was discussed in more than a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many programmes.
Steve Ballmer, has found that if the computers were sold with the necessary instead of applications, they would be five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, after version, has not been added functions and "perks" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operational system loses value, but also its software.
When Google Chrome came on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that a Web browser is not a workable system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is essential for the hardware and software to understand.
It occupies the same function that your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It is true.
It will never be but we must see the 'dead' operating system is not as an absolute truth, but as a truth is relative.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are less and less attention to the operating system but increasingly the navigator.
We switch on the computer only to turn Firefox, explore or chromium and every day, people spend more time browsing the Internet than to go on Windows.
To that serve half the applications submitted with the system?
Perhaps the most is the least.
And Windows 7 will contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less crowded, months, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in starting its own services online so that they ultimately become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo appeared in this article, was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for employees of Microsoft to Redmond.
On the distributor of drinks, a poster asks them to use their own search tool, "your research. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to seek information on the Internet.
The week delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely start at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The telephone, after all, increasingly resembling a computer.
But the launch of Android being delayed and the iPhone is already on the market, this will cost them dear.

Of course, I want to become the mother because my body asks me and I want to become a young mother; I do not want to lose it.

What I will do is give happiness to my son and raise it with a great love.
Turning to the cinema, you look that different films that you made last year.

Repeat offenders of drink-driving will install the system is alcolock '
The interior minister wants the driver, who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, has to fit in his vehicle, a system that makes it impossible to start the vehicle when drunk, or if it does not.
The initiative was already announced in June and it is now in the report of the minister of state in which this initiative is seen as a pilot project that will last a year.
His aim is the reinstatement of the driver in his rehabilitation courses.
The state minister responsible for road safety but also the general direction of Road Safety Foundation and the Technological Institute for security of the car will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for having led more than once in a state of intoxication, includes the car.
The alcolock would prevent it because it is trendy, on the vehicle that measure the level of alcohol in the process and to start the car when the driver does not before; or when the alcohol content of the driver is higher than permitted.
The cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the driver.
In this respect, a study in the United States in 2007 indicated that the vehicles equipped with this system were driving up to 65% of offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain, we believe that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This is the administrative penalties for two reasons: to do against them before they become criminal offences.
And make its implementation, as the legal reform can be made by ordinary ways but, however, reform made by law requires a reform of the organic law.
The facility is not yet available on the Spanish market in any form of trade, although some vehicles industrial and office in already has one of experiments.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress members will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party, which proposes to resettle in the school bus system, as has happened in France.

Speaking in sleeping
A few children speak during the night.

The first time this happens, it may surprise you, but in reality it does not matter.
This is a distortion mild sleep is somniloquie.
It is quite often, especially among children and adolescents.
It is sure that there are more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can be very sporadic (once in life, for example, involved in an episode of high fever), or more regular (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child does not remember nothing.
There is no single, which determines its appearance
They are often linked to other alterations of sleep as the nightmares, the night terrors which were the night énurésies (out at lunch in bed) or the sleepwalking, but it is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very strong or fever, in situations of stress or become agitated.
In any way it is a bit studied.
The intensity with which it happens is also very variable.
It may speak with a small voice of calm, with isolated words, nonetheless, or instead with the screams, tears, long speech...
In cases where the somniloquie becomes very frequently, it would be wise to observe the child and to consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a distortion benign, so there is no treatment, unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is linked to a apnée sleep or stress).
What we can do is take account of a number of preventive measures such as very simple.
Try not to annoy the child before you go to sleep.
So look for games, quiet and avoid programmes or television series that are more or less violent.
With children very nervous and have the death to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them relax internally.
This will allow the child to have a more restful sleep.
As soon as the somniloquies appear to try to stay calm.
Remind you that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember most of what happened.
Useful advice
Do not get on with waking.
It is useless because it is unconscious and you réveilleriez.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and is based.
Remind you that if it is very anguished several times, it is advised to consult a doctor or to check what is causing so much anxiety among children.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), did not tempted to ask for information.
You will get nothing, because in sleeping, it is not aware to arrange his thinking.
Moreover, you hear what he said, but you will not know what it is dreaming of careful how you interpréterez information and conclusions you draw from this.
Never say never to the child that you can ask questions during the night for its secrets.
Not even jokingly.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing of villain, is an episode that has lasted only a few minutes.

Illhaeusern has finally found the road to victory on the ground after a long period of shortages.
Without a great match, the yellow and black people have created the largest number of occasions and have managed to turn a profit for the match.

The sailors have already shown Monday their determination to live, from dawn, tyres and deposits of fuel pellets in the port of Brest, and Lorient, while the demonstrations were to Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel as the sands of Olonne, in the Vendée, where the trawlers have stayed on the quayside, or at the Haven, where a dozen boats have blocked the movement of ships.
The fishermen of the turballe and croisic, Loire-Atlantique, have stopped in the evening the blockade of the massive refinery total of Donges.

Professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, now pay about 50 cents per litre but they believe that the threshold of profitability of a ship is achieved with a diesel below to 0.30 euros per liter.

Obama wins the points in the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was followed by another to know who John McCain or Barack Obama has prevailed.
Not surprisingly, the headquarters of Republican and Democratic campaign have declared their own victory in this duel television would have been followed by a third of American families.
The political analyst David Gergen believes that the provision of John McCain, although he has not been enough 'brilliant' to allow him to halt its decline in opinion polls in five weeks of presidential elections.
The Gallup institute, an opinion poll published on Saturday is an advance of five points to Obama (49% to 44% to McCain), thinks this is the Democrat who has learned the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are those who count, Obama has emerged the winner for 39% of respondents, while 25% of them the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm its advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of her colistier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate.
It is good instincts, "has, however, warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The septuagénaire McCain has been put forward its indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naive" of his opponent on these issues were at the heart of this first showdown.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he has accused several times.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and expertise needed to be president", he also assured.
A line of attack teeth since yesterday in the Republican TV commercials.
Obama has stressed that it represents the future.
Without changes, it was concise and accurate.
It has highlighted his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, though," said this weekend, a Democrat, accusing the Republican chosen not to have grasped the impact of the crisis on 'American Street. "
"during the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing on you, has denounced Obama yesterday, in 20 000 personnesrassemblées for an election rally in North Carolina in driving rain.
It has not even uttered the words' class' or 'workers. "the rout of financial advantage clearly Obama is viewed by Americans as the most able to save the economy to the brink.
"This coming week could be a turning point," said yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared the "good instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current débacle "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implementation by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reiterating that he would manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the unpredictability of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois has also indicated that the achievement of a possible energy independence in the country by promoting renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a system of health insurance.
McCain has sought to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Careful, both candidates have ducked questions on the financial rescue package of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.

In Minsk, 'You have noticed that there was an election, you? "
Young and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square in the capital of Belarus to reject forward the elections.
A few hundred Belarus met on Sunday evening from the closure of polling stations on the central place in Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people were demonstrating against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit have not even voted: "What good, because they will do what they want my voice," said a young.
They do not believe that the regime which has been good to foreign observers to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic watershed.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if elections were considered own observers.
They have not been according to the opposition.
"We have been excluded Electoral Commission and our observers were unable to participate in the counting," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of 12 parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, says Alexander Milinkevich, former opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 and leader of the pro-European, because the important thing is that counts the votes, and at home, it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition are in Parliament is that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry to parliament can mean the area on television, meetings in the regions and the draft laws. "
The opposition must enter the political game because "we must begin a dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and that we do not reform, we will be a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has followed the election process does not recognize the validity of the ballot.
It points out that the figures of participation seem too high, and that voting in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all the manipulation.
"You have noticed that there was an election? asked the Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the two remaining political prisoners released in August this year.
There was nobody in the polling stations.
And there will be the maximum five members of the opposition in parliament, those that best suit in power. "
The silence of the night falls on the place in October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission welcome their success.

The meeting of blood to become course.
Héma-québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation and its president, the Dre Francine décary, had reason to rejoice, because héma-québec became one of the suppliers to the more security and effective.
And it has regained the public trust, which had been seriously dented by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the National Blood Transfusion Service run by the Canadian Red Cross have been infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the virus hepatitis C during the 1980s.
In this tragedy and the public discontent, the government of Canada has set up in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Krever giant, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and make recommendations for such a disaster again.
While the judge Krever tardait to submit its report, some provinces have established a committee aimed to plan a new management system of blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the committee gélineau has fulfilled this term.
À following reports gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: héma-québec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian company of blood to supply all the other provinces and the two territories.
"In 1998, when héma-québec began its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls the Dre décary.
The situation was discouraging.
À strength of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we have returned to public confidence ", according to her before proudly say that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the population québécoise has confidence in héma-québec.
The Dre décary warned however that "confidence is extremely fragile."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, héma-québec has applied the precautionary principle.
À this time it was in Europe to many of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says that is the strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we were not at all if the disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then relied on a key recommendations of the reports Krever and gélineau that when we don't know and that a serious blunder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease characterized by a degenerative brain leads inevitably to death, bringing in measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, it has refused the blood of people who had stayed more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
But there is a few years there has been proved beyond all doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has demonstrated that the precautionary principle that there has been made sense. "
In 1999 has appeared on the market a technique is much more sensitive HIV testing, testing nucléique acid (tan), which can detect directly in the blood of donors in the presence of the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus, which sat the tests used so far.
The Tan helped to shorten the period, which stretches between when the person has been infected and when the first virus can be found in blood by our technical, explains the specialist.
It could reduce this period to less than a week.
It has fallen substantially and the risk that some donors are infected without the knowledge and that we can detect.
These improvements have helped to lower the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million will be given contaminated blood for HIV.
"In other words, it means to distribute 12 million of blood products before someone is infected with HIV.
As héma-québec distributes each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products, it will take over 24 years before that occurs in a case of HIV transmission by a blood products.
I think it can now feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover the health, "says the head of the direction of héma-québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the security of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than last year appeared on the island of the meeting the Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must always be vigilant, "continues the Dre décary before to emphasise that in addition to supply security, héma-québec must also provide an adequate supply.
"The needs are increasing because the population ages.
The anticancéreux being more aggressive treatment, patients often have a need to recharge in red blood cells or plaquettes.
The ageing population also has implications for the network of blood donors who brings together on average 3% of Quebecois of eligible to donate blood. "
Anyone in health, aged 18 years and meet the eligibility criteria can send blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who make their blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS and malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where there is malaria, they will be excluded for a period a year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain a list that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they mature and can no longer give blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but they retain and encourage them to become a regular donor.
The life of today is so rampant, there is rarely the time to spend an hour to give blood, "laments Francine décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, héma-québec not only provides blood products, but also of tissues, including greffons bone, cardiac valves, the Globes eye and skin that is almost exclusively used for serious burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in héma-québec runs as the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks, the Bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and is predicted to take over one thousand per year.
We should begin to offer for transplants at the beginning of next year, "says the Dre décary who described the programme to levy of umbilical cord blood is very popular.
"Several grans are disappointed not to have access to it," because héma-québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive in all hospitals in Quebec.

On the north Charest
The prime minister does not exclude triggering elections before the end of the year
Immediately after the general council of the Liberal party is finished, Jean Charest visited yesterday in Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in the by-election today.
"push the limits of our last great northern border": This is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad outlines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, lévis yesterday.
Behind him during his speech, was projected a mill in pictures.
Go loops, on three huge screens, clichés spectacular power dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google maps, maps, etc.
The great resources as the election period.
As of press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that it would trigger the elections this autumn, although he pointed out that it was very busy.
The North "is the fourth part of a" vision "that the prime minister claims for Quebec, a new economic area", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speech of the prime minister recently, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory in the 49th parallel - had never made a presentation.
The prime minister is, however, resorted to explain why the North was "a jewel in the huge potential", but has not given a deadline, investment figures, and priority in the future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be developed further: the power, the forest, but the mining sector, led by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platine, however, money, iron, titane, and even diamonds," according to the list of Mr Charest.
This' territory twice as large as France ',' that is home, it is in Quebec.
Not only that is home, but it is with us, "he insisted, as well show that he solicited a myth.
The Quebec is much built in its relationship with the North, he said: the rush to gold in Abitibi, engineering québécoise, the Bay James.
"We, our future", he added, having made a dramatic pause to contemplate the vast map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebecois of, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, prime minister said at the point of press.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a line of border on which there was no understanding for very long and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of government ", he said.
The rest, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North", he said in the Northwest Passage, which is open all year because of melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister has said that the government of Quebec would be very careful attention to them and that the project their benefit, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel létourneau (a former member péquiste of Ungava), have already begun consultation with a 30 communities.
A committee chaired by Benedict Pelletier and Julie pellets (transport and natural resources) has an important place has started work.
The prime minister does not preclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment where "there will be a common vision".
The development of the North would be in conformity with the principles of sustainable development.
The North will be "concerted, ordered and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as in continuity with the Prime Minister liberals that preceded it.
"As the liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to transform the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development."
This has been a recurring themes at the end of this week, which began on Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage leading the party.
One of the resolutions adopted is proposing to rename the plant beauharnois in adélard-godbout dam.
"Godbout, which has created Hydro-Québec, Lesage who made the quiet revolution and the nationalisation of the power to Bourassa who made the Bay James, our party has been able to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
As of press, he cited another reference, conservative, the programme "roads to the North" John diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
In the draft of eastmain1a-ruper hydroelectric dam, Mr Charest stressed that its service was scheduled for 2012.
"Ça remains us here, but I expect to be there ', it gave its militants, bringing home the sustained applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not eliminated the possibility to trigger an election this autumn, what the law allows it.
He stresses that his schedule is full, especially by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a summit québec-new York.
The general council of the weekend has given the Liberal leader a platform containing resolutions nationalists, in the 'constitutional aspirations, "which have gone as a letter to the post: the plq calls, especially the recognition," the specificity of Quebec' in the constitution.
It also hope that the Quebec called the council members of the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications and that they have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, it has welcomed the outlines of the plan North with scepticism.
The head péquiste, Pauline Marois, has emerged from the development of the nord-du-québec that the government Landry was launched in 2001.
According to it, the Liberal government, coming to power in 2003, has refused to apply.
If he had done, "it would be more advanced today," commented Mrs Marois alongside its candidate in elections Jean-Talon (today), Françoise Mercury.
The adq said support a plan north by the government.
"But what we hope is that it is not just a spectacle," commented on the leader Sébastien Proulx, to replace Mario Dumont, who returns from holiday today.

A country he letters.
It is Mr Vic Toews, former 'Justice' (ironically) in the Cabinet Harper, who were in the summer of Louise Arbour said she was a "disgrace" to Canada.
And the cast aspersions on this woman who has conducted an unending struggle for justice and deserves admiration as said so long on the entourage of Prime Minister on Stephen Harper itself.
We are facing a government which is the only, of all the Western countries involved, not to have brought back a couple locked in the concentration camp in Guantánamo.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at that time he is accused.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies his floor and stay in inhumane conditions a child soldier.
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Remember, remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadr, so that he has a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government which condone torture: not matter to him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps for ever, after years of abuse.
It does not yet, but we are currently undergoing a rampant erosion of our rights, our freedom and democracy, the word that Harper continues to hold and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
This is the moment where no moral no longer exists: we can bully, torture, according to arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen of a head of government so far in a minority (as it will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in which extols the virtues, law and order: they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, it is, in this shift, and not elsewhere.

Pursuing an Orwellian approach, he says that the biggest airline gold of the world has brought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a "transparent" public debate.
It is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they believe, especially in the case of prosecution in libel, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way of conducting a public debate would lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a contrary position to hers?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and the editor of The Black Book Canada will have to spend large sums to prepare for their defence and fight, arms very unequal, against an army of lawyers, backed by the pockets almost without the mining.
The tactic, in these struggles unequal, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement which bâillonnera opposition in addition to frighten anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate, it is before the public that it would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in several countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally in the exchange of ideas and not with clubs.
It was enough to the mining to open its books, and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding for independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejects dismissing the petitions and letters of support from black Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how it can request a "public" in which the views of the public?
In the world of vice-president, it seems that word means only the lawyers handsomely paid, and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What does not understand - or does not understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of black Canada is primarily because it rejects the brutal manner of the mining.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but based on the exchange civilised arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a poursuite-bâillon (with the "public debate," Barrick Gold has also lodged a formal notice of the authors of black Canada but to stop the use of this term...).
Beyond the speech surréel Mr Garver, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, essential to a democratic society.
She denies, part of the right to the quote to credible sources and the debate on the facts and interpretations, which represent the backbone of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and to discuss issues that do not like the rich companies in this world in a country like Canada, for fear of prosecution in rehearsal, which will be able to do this?
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate and transparent, it could do so in the scientific standards used by the authors of Canada.
It has a right of reply.
The academic world, which we belong, has long known to manage the debate and dissent and resolve conflicts.
The proportion of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims it has no desire to debate a transparent.
This is a loss for the academic world, as in the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place of limiting this kind of abusive lawsuits.

Operation Rescue of Wall Street – Democrats and Republicans are
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of $700 billion dollars to curb the financial crisis affecting Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
It includes: better control by members of its implementation of new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money involved, new provisions to contain the number of foreclosed homes in default, as well as an influence on the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the table, Senator Judd Gregg announced the news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after a marathon negotiations in two days.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement which will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done in order to shield the real economy and the ordinary American of the ongoing crisis in Wall Street," said the Democrat.
"It is the fundamental point: If we are not doing this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The talks had turned into a sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that would cause another failure on investor sentiment.
The time limit that was given was the opening of markets this morning.
Associates late in the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election have been more favourable to the agreement, without fail, however, to express their dissatisfaction that you need to come to that.
The senator, Democrat Barack Obama was awarded the addition of some provisions in the understanding, especially to allow owners to keep their homes and on executive pay companies rescapées by the État.
"When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is not welcome.
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the airwaves on American television.
Asked about another chain, on whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain, said: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The lines that I have read [are] that it is something that we will all have to digest and with which we can move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable ", he said.
The plan of $700 billion to buy up with taxpayers' money the bad debts, assets and sell the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that has led to the collapse of sub-prime mortgages (subprime) before spreading to other forms more widespread in securities of credit (pcaa) and lead to a liquidity freeze and the exodus of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had killed the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to be out of this impasse since Democrats have agreed that some assets "toxic" of companies in trouble are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to cut corners to everyone in Congress, there has also added a provision that if the government should take losses for five years with this programme, it could put in place new taxes to help recover its implementation.
The new plan provides for a first tranche of $250 billion that will add another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 other billion should be approved by another vote in Congress.
In exchange for assistance, Washington will receive shares in companies rescued it be worth of dividends in case of profit and that it will sell when the storm will be passed.
The federal government will take the opportunity to delay the procedures of foreclosures on homes attached to the loans covered by this plan and set limits on pay and redundancy payments paid to executives of companies affected.
The architects of the plan would see before the vote of the House of Representatives from today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not even certain that their plan will take the green light.
The votes have continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican side that Democrat.
"Obviously, Washington did not intend to," said to his constituents, the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the finance committee of the house.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of taxpayers'.
Leader of a small group in Congress nicknamed "the caucus of sceptics", the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents differently, but comes at the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to tell us: we are asking the Congress not to hurry and carefully consider the way to take", he said yesterday.
Meanwhile, in Europe, we had once again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis to 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it is refusing to acquire its rival in trouble since she has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of mortgages in the États-unis.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of 20 major European banks and the ten biggest insurers.
"This is not wasted money, said yesterday the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos.
In exchange, they get a vote in the bank and influence.
This is something that savers and households are now that the time looks uncertain. "
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seemed on course to nationalise another bank rocked by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government will resume his account of all the loans at the bank Bradford and bringley, more than 41 billion (75,5 billion US) of mortgages.
The Spanish bank Santander has announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and the accounts customers of the British bank.
The Bradford and bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.

Paul Newman (1925-2008) - death of an icon committed
Its beauty in the eyes of a blue card was long, some would say its weakness.
If it was released from the mirror narcissique, the American player to smile about charmer?
Yes and no.
Modesty, his sensitivity and a talent who was sinking to the will also have a far cry from the register of power that is actually giving rise to the real sacred monsters.
But what a great runner of substance.
Paul Newman, disappeared on Friday, at 83 years, after lung cancer at his Crawford ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icônes American film of the good years.
Less monumental as Brando, to which it was and how it was long a rival to the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also great champion of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
The blood involved are often beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a senior German Jew and a Hungarian mother of origin.
The European roots will generate a glorious faces in the American dream.
Without huge egos, the final mark of quality.
Because it is projeta a whole country enamored of the self made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in battle, which in the early 1950s étudia art dramatic to Yale and then fréquenta actor' if the studio in New York, before succeeding at the theatre, television, soon to film.
The same man who milita for civil rights was also the pilot cars, which is classa second for 24 hours of mans in 1979, doubled to a sex symbol, albeit a member of a couple model trained since 1958, with the actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappearing with it the vagueness of this star secret, quiet, committed, allergic to pieces of bread, which will not entirely holes the enigma.
An honest man, in the truest sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has brought the dizzying array to the cinema goers later this week, then that is endlessly its major roles on the screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh art American ever-changing people around him.
Returning compete in memory of the cowboy charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man sensuelle rejecting his wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the chatte roof on a hot line of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr Bridge, troubled by his old age by a marriage, which did not fulfil all its promises.
Many other Paul Newman are shrouded in history.
This boxeur Rocky Graziano, criminal, harried, violent, departed in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, resumed after his death, which launched really Newman in 1956.
A small-time criminal will appealing in the brillantissime the sting (the scam), Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter and Avenger by ping pong player in the magnificent the hustler Robert Rossen (1961), it will resume the man on the return in the color of money to Martin Scorsese, which won him in 1987, his only Oscar on nine nominations.
The face through the ages, it was him.
Yet it.
The Times jostling through its journey.
Young people know it all through the cultissime We slap George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach a team of ice hockey unorthodox.
His fans have found in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy brothers Coen.
With a final role of Mafia godfather of the Irish in road to distress of Sam Mendes in 2003, the picture was completed.
À against several legends film, which lâchèrent soon enough, Newman will come a long time on board, while denouncing Hollywood, its TARP has its good and his concessions.
The French film-maker Bertrand Tavernier regarded, not without humour, "as a challenge in the 'underplaying" judging its benefits too supported.
The profession has not always been kind to the wonderful Paul Newman in which the roles fell a long time all cooked in the tooth.
He played less often young people first that the Fringe: neurotic, alcoholics, swines or desperate, including its features perfect reflétèrent excesses and the uproar.
As director, Newman revealed aspects poorly known, both of his true feelings.
Its Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, traçait an end female portrait of melancholy.
He lost his son Scott by overdose him dédia his film Harry and his in 1984, modest and sad.
Among the rain of tributes which déferlait yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in the sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) was very saddened, "his presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love of life are vibrants features of the actor disappeared.
Across his career of legend, is fading away a great campaigner for the civil rights, ecology, Film Independent, an opposition of the excesses of Hollywood.
We have seen much of its Binette allowed to grace the vinaigrette pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, so the process of poor taste, albeit a joke at the start.
The profits of these sales were nonetheless paid to his foundation for children in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will be committed.
He has left its five girls a letter containing these words: "until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for.
It was a privilege to be here. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of an American artist if lucid and generous.

That could well produce Zuschlag &amp; the company in their factory to bills?
Soon, on 8 October, will start the proceedings relating to the criminal process underway, János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud in the form of criminal organisation, permanently and regularly, having led to the damage, especially important. Other charges have been held against them, such as false and use of false.
According to the public prosecutor, money from subsidies, was spent for personal gain, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the État and municipalities, approximately 65 million Huf in total, was in the coffers of the movement Fiatal baloldal and, in the pockets of some people.
Their method, made public by the authorities of the inquiry, was to touch the money subsidies received by issuing bills of expenses, behind which no real provision was given and the associations have never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were untrue.
For these, they are - books józsefváros bills in the market, while they fabriquaient stamps to Kiskunhalas.
For the names of societies that were included on the bills, it was decided, among others, during tours in the province of north of Lake Balaton, carried out by István lados, János Zuschlag on request.
According to the testimony of the latter, it was to identify pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he called for a bill, modeled on which they would other bills that they would include, among others, from the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the city of the capital for access to grants.
The majority of bills was created by István lados and his accomplice Mr Őri, according to our information, was involved in drafting the files needed to qualify for subsidies.
In a "circuit to spot," a choice of lados was a bistro.
According to the two bills issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Association biztos bridge egyesület.
However, according to what the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people in this place, as well.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the bill on behalf of the foundation jobb jövőért which will bear the name of együtt has harmadik Évezredért, grouillait mistakes of form and content.
A pension, based in badacsonytomaj did in fact that three houses, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night. However, the bill was one hundred and thirty clients.
Issuers of bills to the imagination restless have also fallen in excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal KFT, even in the catering industry. In their accounts, or the name of jobb jövőért nor the hoppá does not appear, according to the information given to the prosecutor.
Győző Farkas the manager of society, said the site hvg.hu when the public prosecutor has called him and has shown the bills, he knew immediately that it was false documents.
"The name of our society and number of tax were placed in a bad place on the stamp."
He added: "beyond the fact that after the bill, a hundred people were housed there, not very truthful headline either, as this has only 11 bedrooms, which were not so much space.
The bill also mentions of the meal, and our restaurant is closed for much longer. "
Issuers of bills accomplices were not informed on the travel agencies of Budapest, part of their choice, but only organising trips abroad. Thus, naively, they said residency in Hungary on bills to pay in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
Also, as it emerged during the investigation, they also ccee VAT on these documents, while the benefits on the activities of travel, which is outside the European Union, are paid for without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four bills based on behalf of the hotel révfülöp the order of jobb jövőért was incorrect, because the benefits of society do not bear a vat of 25%, as pointed out, but a VAT to 15%. In addition, employees of the hotel to emit the bills are printed, while the false were prepared to hand.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "Issuers have also made mistakes, stating that provide the Road Haulage, that the company issuing bills could not exercise, given that his profile was the council in investment.
This is also for the sins of forms, as the types of bills inadequate and counterfeit pills, which bills issued the order of együtt has harmadik Évezredért alapítvány, 21st. Századi kulturális egyesület and biztos Bridge proved false.
As in the case of society Ravenna bt. or sporting kunfehértó internship, who both deny perpetrators of invoices in their name.
Counterfeiters have not paid attention to the fact that society Hib KFT., established in nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (2001) the group of Fiatal városért egyesület was supposed to take a meal at home. Our information, this is why the liquidateur of the company denies having made this bill.
Bills set deliberately
A group of other issuers of bills is composed of those who were fully aware that they were asked to pass bills.
The foundation esély budapestért alapítvány, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal baloldal - ifjú szocialisták, has established a bill to the next to the foundation együtt has harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million Huf.
According to the indictment, the manager of society Collab kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic györfi.
Similarly, has cooperated with the zuschlags, society biogate KFT., which is currently under liquidation and that in 2003, issued bills on the order of the foundation jobb jövőért alapítvány, the Association atlasz egyesület and the Association vörösfenyő egyesület, amounting to around five million Huf but, behind which no provision has actually been provided.
No financial movement has taken place, either, given that the invoices were cancelled by the result, but that the bodies have avoided mention in their accounts.
The group of companies issuing bills is that companies directly related to the accused.
As well, the administration's director general of the Delta trió KFT., addressing the trade of fuel and cars, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where there was nowhere to be found, was Iván kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company has issued several bills on the sale of computer equipment, for a sum of about 18 million Huf.
According to the investigation, such equipment would have been purchased by the company cash investment kft. of Kiskunhalas, which was being wound up since the September 14, 2005.
The director of the company was a man from Romania, who Iván kubatov would also have sent documents in connection with society, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, kubatov acknowledged during the inquiry that it issued bills on the order of companies atlasz, hoppá and együtt has harmadik Évezredért alapítvány, and he has earned their equivalent.
It is precisely at the request of Iván kubatov that builders Romanians have created the companies fa-bani Jos faipari kft. and jos-investment BT.
In fact, none of these companies worked, that the accused is that they did not receive work.
He served when even those companies, because at the request of maestro Zsolt szente, coaccusé as well as editor of corporate foundation, established the Bills to their names, the order of associations with Zuschlag, as the associations atlasz and y-generáció.
Kubatov gave the bodies, 15 bills in total, issued by companies cash investment, Delta trió, fa-bani Jos, Jos investment and linaxtrade with a value of 14,2 million Huf.
The public prosecutor believed that 10% are listed on the bills as well as VAT were in the pockets of kubatov.
The man has even used the company szi-beri bt. to establish the fictitious bills that have been used as part of the request of subsidy for biztos bridge.
In January 2006, the Association y-generáció and szövetség has modern magyarországért have applied for a grant from the body of public utility of the Socialist Party, táncsics Mihály alapítvány (MRI).
They have achieved this subsidy for the amount of 500 Huf twice, but these amounts were not used for the objectives set out in demand.
In order to prevent it happening, five bills fictitious received from the company works team kft. have been presented to the MRI.
Moreover, these bills that have been found during the raid in the office of Árpád kemecsei, the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, part of the accused relatera method of production of bills, as it had already done before the public prosecutor earlier.
What could be really interesting is that the accused, János Zuschlag himself, decided to lift the veil on history.
Until now, its admissions are not very detailed, and although it has promised repeatedly telling detail, it has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in its interest, or, perhaps, the Socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million Huf, Zusi would only the hat.
Today, it is likely to be insulted, since the requests for his placement under house arrest, on the basis of a reduction of its conditions of detention, continued to fall on deaf ears.
While those who have caused damage much more important, and the authors of economic crimes, not repairable, roam freely or at least, waiting for their own home, the end of the procedure. He has not this possibility.

The psychology of the bidding war: why do we think more money?
At auction, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the commodity.
The researchers in neurology and economy of the University of New York have managed to update the neural bases and economic behaviour known and seemingly irrational.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be dependent on this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, which is why they prefer to even pay too high a price.
These studies have tried to set a pattern of this kind of neural "game" with the help of auctions experiments.
One of the groups of volunteers playing the lottery, while the other group was involved in an auction playful, while using a process of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), the researchers analysaient brain areas of the experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could make money, but during the auction with a key element is the surfeit of a third, all under the waistline brain, called striatum, were moving in a crash at the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, in addition to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism "auto-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to researchers, the rise in prices is with the brain before the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, members of this group of researchers have pursued analyses of financial supervision.
In these three groups surenchérissaient with a partner in various circumstances.
They were simply informed the group monitoring the real value of the product in question, and they have done their implementation.
Another group, they have promised that if they went to winners of the game, then they would receive $15 additional, reward.
While the third group has received the $15 before the auction, but the group also lose money if they lose the auction.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was put in on victory, while another, on the failure.
In demonstrating the assumption of neurologues, members of the team of players' against the failure "were willing to put higher than those made by the group control and the group" for victory. "
"These results cannot be proven by any economic theory that already exists.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena noted at auctions by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only the neural imaging methods have helped remove the contradiction between the two theories, leading on a third explanation. "- found Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.

Hepatitis: when do we see a doctor?
In the world, around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic disease of the liver is mentioned among the main causes of death.
An estimated 100 miles patients infected with hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles following treatment. This is the fact that often patients do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infection affecting the liver and caused by different virus.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and jaunisse are characteristics, but the pathogens and disease caused differ.
The virus hepatitis, according to genes, pathogens spread mainly in two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: food or water contaminated), the hepatitis B, C, D and the other virus in blood and liquids -- organic (sperm, vaginal, salive).
For passengers, it is recommended to be vaccinated against the virus has A and B. There is no vaccine against it.
The symptoms of hepatitis has included two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated feed, in general, accompanied by a poor state general weakness, upset stomach and nausea.
Then there is growing on the skin and white of the eye a jaunisse visible, the selles become more clear and the urine is a colour more foncée. The recovery could take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, every year, a million people die of the most serious of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis has got the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that according to estimates, only one patient on ten receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know reached the virus, because the gene pathogenic destroyed a sly liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear that after 20 to 30 years.
Consequently, an early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: those who suffered a blood transfusion before 1991, the consumer of drugs and the tatoués.
Currently, we figure to 200 million patients suffering from a type of chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in a laboratory, it is advised to consult their doctor dealing with the observation of symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer has warned.
On 30 September is the world day of hepatitis, organised for the first time in 2004 by the bodies representative of patients from all corners of the world.
His aim is to draw attention to the liver cirrhosis has got a chronic, caused by viruses, on the causes of its development and on the importance of the early diagnosis of illness.

Anyone who believes in God has he less pain?
According to the results of recent research, the religious beliefs would work as a kind of pain reliever, who would have already made more bearable, the death of Catholic martyrs.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experience in looking at what level the belief in God could influence the tolerance to the pain of human beings.
As part of this experience for the bizarre 12 Catholic believers, and as many atheists have been subjected to electric shock treatment, while each of them from a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the faithful Catholics have been able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation the human brain, was also able to discover that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating the pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, which academics, scientists, philosophers, theologians are from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experience is as follows: an instrument that emit sparks and broadcasting the ECT is set on the left hand of the experimental subject.
Researchers have asked the participants of the experience of watching a sustained two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato what was done in the 1600s and another, the lady in the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the highly publicized 15th century.
Researchers at the origin of this experience had hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary is a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of da Vinci, not very different from the first, was on its calming effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scan, and during this time, received 20 ect four part is a worthy successor, watching the paint religious theme, the more general.
Catholics have said that in view of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", as someone whose "takes care" and they are quiet, and peace has invaded. "
At the sight of the painting of religious themes, they have reported a 12% of pain in less than when they watched the work of Leonard.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who had taken part in experience, believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, atheists, provided to find the photo appropriate.
"We should find a picture in which they respond very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, has welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, changes in our personality," added Wright.
After these excellent results, there is more than the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain issues if it shows the believers a Madone painted by Leonard or a painter of the same arms?
Does the sight of a Virgin Mary of better quality would lead to better results?

You are what you to your subject divulgues
In the tenth anniversary, Google says that we can find at the bottom of the pockets of people as the sky above their heads. He knows where they have spent their summer holidays, which experts they look and what their interests.
This is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While the sceptics, establishing a parallel with the vision of the horror of Orwell, they are not the bulk of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said, there is little, the Financial Times that of Google's main ambition is to gather more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can keep their original purpose, which was as follows: "set out in a system all the information in the world!".
According to the leader of Google asked, after ten years of work to chamboulement world, they are still at the beginning of their targets to be able to deal with all the information.
The question: what will be in five years ago? Schmidt replied that he would like Google can answer questions such as "that I could do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that I would be better?". However, software can only respond to this type of question, simple at first sight, as when they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used in research on the Internet, the IP address of the computer, which sends research and the pages retrieved then by those involved are listed.
Through the programme personalized search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own historical research and can see what they have sought, what they have cliqué. Through this long-term recommendations, based on the same logic, will be able to give much more intimate, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences.
What happens if someone is using my data against me, if it looks at what is my job? asking users, who worry about seeing the monopoly of information to Google.
In most cases, it is the power potential represented by society, which can cause of fear, and this is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can arouse a contre-réaction Internet users.
It is, however, a fact confirmed that the terms being sought are not only registered, but in the case warranted, they are sent to a third, and in this type of case law, nothing to protect the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding these days is probably the coordinated action against paedophiles Brazilians, in which Google has sent to the Brazilian government information that he had collected on the page called Orkut public, thereby allowing identification.
Internet users mindful of human rights have been able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arms into disarray with the body of legal protection for electronic Eff, has proved its right to the court with the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will not be bound by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the request secret FBI, of whatever kind.
(Meanwhile, the federal government has been successfully nearly 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 research he had won by the strengthening of the law on child protection, voted for several years ago. Ultimately, it fails to acquire the lists of investigations of individual users, or the whole list of Internet sites and keywords in the past two months.)
The judgment of Google is quite inconsistent: it is attacked by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think their inner world and their private sector suffer when they are starting to use the services of Google. Therefore, they argue against them in the spirit of revolt that there are protests against the companies that are proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, culture geek American and its "sauvageons" between the passionate, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of big business, "the corporation trendy ', as opposed to his rival, Microsoft, classified as invader in the world because of windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users to identification code, not asking for money for its applications. The Code documentary and the package of programmes, continually cooler, has a much more accessible, younger and more cool, with the practice of the software giant.
The reason may also be the geeks are exactly the problematic relationship between the individual rights and the Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the key word as announced in recent years, just behind him.
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is not something other than the collaboration, the fact that we are intentionally traces behind us, and that we use of communication channels available to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essence remains the same: it is exposed.
A young, in general, can take a profile on several pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and it can connect them to other services, such as at twinter, or Last.fm, listant musical habits, and then it can connect them to a system of prosecution, as FriendFeed or blip.fm. these young people can also take blogs, in which are automatically their most recent gallery of pictures they stock on Flickr, or on Picasa.
While you can read many examples, such as the girlfriend who is easily understandable to view photos of the morning, taken by the circle of friends in common, with which his friend unfaithful has spent the evening, or the society that has dismissed one of its employees, for the honest opinions that he wrote on his blog on the top management, we can be on one thing: the end of privacy is completely to reconsider these days.
Anyone who lives a life online, is composed of what it shows itself, and so we can establish the principle behind the behaviour of young people today.
That is hiding something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can do (starting with, for example, Scroogle, using the system to search Google, but, at the same time, leaving intentionally no sign).
The number of people who deliberately, are not public pages so that it should not be possible to locate them, is not insignificant. The services of Google online, via the treatment of text to the treatment of image, the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to a huge range of servers and assemble not our best, having been to date.
The public expects, without really is in hiding, when Google will reveal his true nature.
The company, with its present value of 156 billion dollars, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). The advertising AdWords / adsense threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at a speed of increasingly important cause of severe headaches, not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs.
However, those criticisms are, in addition to all this, the contradictions of worrying effects: for example, the top management Society has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the kindergarten and company after the company has found it too expensive restaurants multiple daily, taken at any time. All this pales next to the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced to the Chinese government and under the terms of their agreement, the company sees all the results that offends the good taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of society, the new services are not announced when they can be used. What is on is that in the coming months and years, they will get the world on new points. While some believe that the project to scan and archiving of books and magazines Google takes the dimensions so large that society will soon face the Supreme Court of États-unis, others are afraid to its health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical benefit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is a genetic data can give a good raw material for the next generation of science fiction. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, writing with demi-tons orwelliens, described the future in which a man could be approached in a horrendous only through the data to Google.

The stock of Warsaw made a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The stock market values of Warsaw has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion kronor in the Czech Republic, for the purchase of 100% of the package of shares of the stock market values of Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the stock market values of Warsaw, confirmed this proposal that the Poles have made despite that, earlier, the Czechs have ruled out the Warsaw stock of the circle of potential new owners of the stock market in Prague.
The cause of this exclusion is that the stock of Warsaw is owned by the État.
99% of the actions are owned by the État Poles who wants to secede from more than 60% of its actions in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech E15 Business Daily, the proposal of Poles represents the most high which was made to date for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the stock market in Vienna, the transatlantic exchange Nasdaq, the stock exchange in New York, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Koblic Petr, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw stock market would be the new owner the less good, and has not ruled out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated between 5 to 10 billion kronor in the Czech Republic by specialists in the market.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of papers would be sold.
The biggest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria finance, with about 25 percent of shares, followed by 14.7 percent of the bank ceská sporitelna and the tiger holding oven S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.

The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments Tuesday dedicated to the international financial crisis worsening, the newspaper leaders of the European press reported a "second 11 September."
"The global financial disaster, it should the American President", accusing the Rome daily La Repubblica. "the president has not been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised rushed to help a depressing..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as was the billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk of a second 11 September.
Some of the press Madrid also sees the scapegoat for Washington.
According to the vision of the daily newspaper El Mundo, the failings of the political leadership in there who led the world economy teetering on collapse.
The danger of collapse of the US financial system is accroit every day, and thereafter, the world will pay dearly.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the vote in Congress, a real threat that Washington does not propose a political tool for addressing the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the vacuum, just when the history of capitalism, one of the biggest changes took place.
We cannot ignore the threat of longer – underlines the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states can still offer a lifeline to their financial institutions titubants, and thanks to their own taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks collapsing like dominoes, then neither money nor new improvisations will not be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the member of the European Union did little of their national self-interest, and they centralises control over the financial markets.
Nothing that Monday, the weakened financial institutions have received more than 100 billion - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers also will have to delve into the pockets, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to resolve the crisis, are becoming more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really occupied the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, hand in hand, the old continent.
The "rescue workers' should not fly straight to 100 billion, by contrast it would be wise if they notaient how it would be rational to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim to prevent more serious damage.

The Smart car following the theft of Bourdon
What method would be best to develop technologies to avoid an obstacle, if not imitation of a sensor obstacles that already exists in nature?
As for example, one of bees.
In the draft surprising presented at the CEATEC, with Japan, bees bourdonnantes gave the idea a strategic departure to the engineers from Nissan, for inspiration on how they need to design the next generation of detectors obstacles.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a system in order auto-robotisé bio-inspiré such BR23C, it has equipped the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all the obstacles.
At its flights, each bee is its own space, to form Oval, which in reality is very similar to the hulls of protection of safe, said at the exhibition, kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the Department research and development and public relations technology of the brand.
The eye to facets of the bee plays an important role, as it is able to see in all directions, in terms of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the eye to facets, engineers have raised the idea of télémètre to laser.
It identifies the obstacles in a way of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, who turns into avoidance maneuver.
The perception of the barrier is taking place in a split second. Then, the Mini car robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, changing the direction of its wheels in the end of a light enough to avoid the collision.
Unlike any system that currently exist, this avoidance is taking place entirely an instinctive.
"If it was not as well, the Mini car robot could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh laboratory, the director of mobility and the car robotisée project.
It must respond instinctive and instantly, as this technology is the most vulnerable and most of the envelope, a layer of protection for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process should reflect what the bee to prevent other bees.
The process must take place in an instant.
The opposite of bees, the difference may not be upwards, to the bottom or diagonal, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of endless combinations of bees to prevent other bees in our case, there has been able to use as the movement rotatif, speeding up and the slowdown as moves to the provision of the Mini car robot
The BR23C uses lithium batteries polymère which are lighter and whose combination of energy is great, what makes their living longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh is the intelligent instinctive reaction which is essential, not the data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism must deal with some incoming messages per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to the store and react with the intuitive logic is based on data from previous games. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-octets of memory in continues.
We do not need memory capacity gigabits, or even méga-octets.
It is the first step towards the concept of a technology for the avoidance instantly. According to estimates of Nissan, this system will make its entry into the cars manufactured in the series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its inclusion in the GPS satellite navigation system, so it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding the obstacles on his way.

It has even given a name the baby overpriced
The written version of the economic recovery plan of $700 billion to buy troubled loans from banks, and to use in several times, is ready.
In the first round, half that amount will be spent.
Reuters News that during debates even until after midnight local time Saturday in the East Coast, the leaders of Congress agreed on the controversy that exists for days and days, around the rescue plan for a total of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward", said Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of the US House of Representatives, according to which we can only put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born out of the plan is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the programme will work and will be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not here, the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the workings of the economy in another direction.
The written version of the plan has been made public before the opening of the Asian markets, on Sunday night at 20h local time in Washington (i.e., on Monday at 2 a.m. the morning, according to the local time in Central Europe), but has not led to rise dramatically in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote the bill, responding on behalf of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with progress achieved last night and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy", said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
Moreover, the programme is the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which she mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent only once, for the purchase of securities on the appropriations.
Now, maximum half the sum of $700 billion can be used. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This amount will be the Treasury secretary to buy bad loans from banks, while the use of $100 billion more will be left at the discretion of the president.
The programme will be overseen by an independent body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will take part too.
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree in Congress.
Under the law, the Secretariat of the Treasury will be able to implement a strategy combined: It can also buy bad loans and securities related to mortgages and dubious mortgages and other types of debt "toxic".
The people of the ministry said that bailouts can take place within the framework of an auction, but also directly.
The rule allows companies to take part in an insurance program, where the Secretariat of the Treasury guarantees the tools to the origin of concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium equivalent to the damage.
Henry Paulson has said that the law provides the tools needed to spend $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, the vast buyback of dubious claims to their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system triggers the collapse of one or another financial institution.
"We shall take the necessary measures, to be prepared to law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
However, bankers are in bad position and waiting for aid from the État can expect their redundancy payments, called simply gilded parachute overseas, will be limited by the government.
The cap on salaries is not mentioned in the specific case. For more restrictions on how the Secretariat of the Treasury proposes its aid to the company.
The principle of the cap means that if the Secretariat of the Treasury buying up in an auction, they prélèveront a surplus of tax on the gilded parachute, unless the bank president discredited went into retirement.
Immediately after the purchase of bad debts, the government will aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders should not be exaggerated.
For the image is complete, we still need to add that the golden parachutes existing have not been modified. The cap is that the new contracts, to motivate and participation in the plan.
It is the first time in the history of États-unis that legal ceilings limits will be in force on the allowances of the directors - has commented on the commission president in charge of financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
The État is a right to buy shares in banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk to taxpayers, because they can even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it saved the banks will return on their legs.
The draft law says that within five years ahead, the president must submit to Congress, a proposal that will rule on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
The two sides, there was obviously those who have expressed doubts about the plan.
It is not what the American people we have commissioned, this does not protect the dollars of taxpayers - said the Republican member of California, Darrell Issa.
His colleague, Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur think the same people are pushing the measures, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The press cuttings of German language
The camp on the right is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware, this refers to the Der Spiegel, the low score of the Bavarian Christian Social Union in the country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de.)
In the Internet of magazine publishing information on the left German, Franz Walter analysis the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours her fathers."
According to this political scientist acknowledged, the erosion of the CSU started before the duo beckstein-huber takes office.
The Socialists Christians have transformed the Bavaria for decades and now, those same modern citizens who are turning their backs.
This change of time is the problem of all Christian democracy, and this fact, also of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, came to end a process that was likely to it, just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony in the national party ended.
There are 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU is ramassait with 47.7 percent, and for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent.
It has said it was three years ago during the election of the Bundestag in 2005 when the much talked about Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernisation "devouring her parents', put in place in the region so consistently by the CSU.
It is 40 years, sociologists say that but they have been misled about the pace, secularization, the results of Education and the establishment of Germans of the north and is in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not stay without consequences on the loyalty of voters.
An update goes hand-in-hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The camp on the right is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more and more stubborn.
It is astonishing that in recent weeks, this is precisely the classical groups of citizens who are quite far away from CSU, such as the self-employed, artisans, holders of the box and the graduate studies.
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40 percent.

The press (diepresse.com.)
In his article entitled "who?? the party chairman of the reserve when faced with questions of the coalition," the conservative Austrian newspaper is dealing with the situation of domestic policy confusing which has gone after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the spÖ wish to discuss with the Conservatives in the Övp.
The Övp prohibits the spÖ of meddling in its internal affairs.
The populist party bzÖ is open for negotiations. The greens are still not agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates on public television, the party leaders have barely be seen their cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the spÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the Övp.
The spÖ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is indeed possible - it is what already exists in some regions and in the partnership socialist.
The question that it would envision a coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current president of the Övp as vice-chancellor, remains open to the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the direction schüssel-molterer was, in any case, rejected.
A replay of this combination is beyond question.
Molter reacted with caution to the proposals of red.
As it has already said, a collaboration will surely be a failure if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the Övp.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is a very open. These items must be discussed within the Övp.
Jörg Haider, president of the bzÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"to avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume the government responsibilities," said Haider.

Járóka said: We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today, began in Paris, the European summit for the Égalité opportunities, including the guest is France, as representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message presentations to the house, as one of the main mouthpieces of the consultation with experts, lívia járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, has drawn attention to segregation in education, because this is a violation of law, which affects most Roma children, and one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French presidency, this high level conference has been opened by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European commissioner for work, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of the legal protection and civilian agencies, in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the bureau's press group of Fidesz party járóka warned that the distinctions in the recruitment, Roma disappear from the labour market, in first place, following their qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma have no qualifications of secondary, and as a consequence of a basic education for poor quality, only a tiny part has the opportunity to obtain a degree in higher education."
Moreover, járóka has insisted that education as a fundamental right of human beings plays a key role when the other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a circle the widest possible between Roma and the non-roms.
Indeed, earlier a Roma child starts school, it increases its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by the tax paid from his income and consumption, he is involved in the budget État.
"by their nationality of the European Union, the Roma should be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from education to poor quality and sectarian." - stressed lívia járóka.
According to the member, a collaboration of the European Union geared towards a goal and action is needed for an immediate accelerated the process of desegregation of schools. For this, the directives of existing anti-discrimination and preparation is of paramount importance.
"We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed. We must give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can take part as citizens of right in the future of Europe" - has demanded járóka.
On behalf of "year for the Égalité opportunities" guaranteed for all, the summit's aim for equality in Europe held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure a unique platform to support the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and for the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and within individual countries.

CSU: Thanks for a transition period.
It is in October that will be taken the decision on the fate of the duo failed huber-beckstein
Despite this pathetic failure, the head are not yet fallen, and the debate on the personal issues to the summits of the Bavarian Christian Social Union has been postponed.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the leader of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is: How will the grace?
The fate of tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the party congress, held last weekend in October.
Members of the pair were heavily criticised in any case, felt that they failed to specifically to their seats.
Thanks to this, they are employed to appease the angry members of the group and the basis, which a day after the tsunami Bavarian "demanded of personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
It is five years - it is true, even under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, on top of his career - the union socio-chrétienne winning 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there are only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the single "sovereign" Bavaria with 18 percent of GDP.
But, conservatives have always strongly in the southern region, important key to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal restructuring of the party, the vice president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as a possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this small group of recognition, who initiate discussions feeling our way ahead with the liberal FDP, and with the electeurs free, trained on the values of right, about a possible coalition government in Munich.
A mockery strange fate has been using the list of electeurs free, in the legislation Gabriele Pauli, including taking action against stroiber served as a possible coup by the duo huber-beckstein, then to address bluntly the very ambitious woman municipal politics.
Now, leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilise, somehow, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, which until now was the strings behind the scenes will be an active role. The former head of regional government and former chairman of the CSU, has appointed on 28 September as the most bitter of his political career.
On Monday, Huber has launched a scathing remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have earned a lot more support from the sister party.
Other politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the election Bundestag, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will again be Chancellor if they are up in one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, having played an important role in the success of 2005.
According to Merkel, barely concealing his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU is not playing to the grand coalition in Berlin.
Which is on because it will not be easier to manage the CSU injured, and the crisis of the Social Democrats lasts forever.
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18,6 per cent in Bavaria.

Lukasenko - rivals 110 - 0.
No member of the opposition came to parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian monitors, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, who gives her prosperity and stability, while the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by something illegal committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections.
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million works well in opposition for many decades before the election yesterday, the opposition joining forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (odsz) had hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, in the footsteps of changing the constitution in 2006, 'would' this time the presence of some members of the opposition in parliament.
This odsz renounced his boycotting originally planned.
The fact that Belarus, economically dependent on increasingly Russia, would improve its relations with the EU, where because of the political order of Belarus as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition, Belarus has taken a loan because of lower imports of Russian natural gas, always more expensive, and has contributed to this section of society Beltransgaz, owner of led to gas across the country, went to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE in the evaluation of the campaign, stressed the positive changes rather than on areas such as the ban to run for a third of candidates for the opposition, was referring to an easing in advance.
However, the release of the OSCE Monday challenging the campaign, during which most of the candidates for the opposition could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition feels quite an improvement palpable in the political regime: the political detainees have found freedom, and Minsk is ready to small confrontation with Moscow, still in refusing to recognise South Ossetia and abazzia split from Georgia, Russia and Belarus form a federation on paper, consider the two territories as independent for a month.
"We took two steps forward, and a step backwards, but the most important is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU", said Alexander Milinkevich our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that it remains, despite that "the power has been afraid to parliament which has no weight, to make even a single opponent".
The opposition does not provide for actions of protests in light of the results. It is trying to get his message on the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"We obviously have a lot of concern in this area: we need to print newspapers opponents in Russia, local authorities we put up obstacles for the spread, but I can see that they are increasingly to support the elections, even in the circle of elderly people," said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers the social security as its main outcome, the ozone pensioners most supported officially regard him as much as appropriate.
"Because of the indebtedness of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, evoking the silence of a graveyard, is just a matter of time" - think Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian monitors have described the democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the Commonwealth of Independent États, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in action.". In this way, the absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarussian voters.

And he adds that it is essential to make more efficient, public administration.
The Italian, "whose dynamic salariales- explains the ministre- these 8-10 years have doubled in the private sector, and well above the rate of inflation.
Meanwhile, thousands of employees, have joined together to challenge the standards of the decree Brunetta making use of the Codacons.

Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "prevention is crucial."
Every day, in Italy, one day, accidents, 3 people dead and 27 people who are disabled permanently.
In 2007, the data inail confirms that the dead White were about 1 200.
The figures indicate the gravity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
For the attention of institutions, the social forces and resources for information on this dramatic, the anmil famous today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58ème national day of the victims of accidents on the work, institutionalised the second Sunday in October.
"The worrying information provided by the anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of prevention in the workplace," says the French president Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to President of the anmil, National Association of maimed and disabled, Pietro mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "sincere appreciation for the ongoing effort associations in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of workers injured, assistance to families of victims and raise public awareness."
"Naturally, everyone has hit the table to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, and raise the rest of media and the participation of public opinion, even if the reality we present the case dramatic repetitive in their dynamic.
Napolitano will not deny that "there is certainly a matter of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information."
The many initiatives promoted in the schools, bear a special significance for greater awareness of the young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to keep the attention to this phenomenon, not in assessing the alarm about the seriousness of social and improve the standards.
The president of the house Gianfranco Fini has pointed out that "this phenomenon of dead white is a social emergency, who insult the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions, to make a real effort to end quickly".
The data of victims on the job appear to point out a slight positive trend, but that the number of dead white is impressive, "said later the president of the anmil Pietro mercandelli.
"We do not want this trend on the cheap 'does in fact a minor attention because it is precisely when the attention to release, that the tragedy.
"We believe that in general, it is not doing enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"I nous- stressed mercandelli- more checks and inspections are necessary, as greater intervention on the training of workers, and that, at school."
It has ajouté- "that it must make another effort on the communication and raise public awareness.
"But it must above all, a greater sense of responsibility from employers with a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
"mercandelli subsequently denounced" the progressive deterioration of the conditions to safeguard the compensation for victims of the work "and" the drift of assistance to the system is moving in recent years ".
"The objective, is to give the worker guarantee insurance – it has ajouté- so that the fate of anyone who has an accident, must not depend on the spontanéisme or enlargement of the legislature."

MP3 player finger, they put at risk the hearing.
Ecouter music at full volume for a protracted period using portable music devices like MP3 players, can cause permanent damage to the hearing.
That announcement, the European Commission, which, in a statement circulated in Brussels, quote the scientific committee on the health risks, unexpected and recently identified (csrseri), published today.
"This report scientifique- read us in the note- it emerged that 5-10% of those who, during a period of at least 5 years listening to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than one hour per day per week, risking a permanent loss of the hearing."
"I am concerned that so many young people who frequently make use of portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, unconsciously can damage their hearing an irreparable," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to data scientifiques- continues the responsible ue- it is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most is to raise awareness among consumers and make information of public domain.
We need to revisit the existing control systems, given the scientific opinion, so that they are entirely effective and can follow the new technologies. "
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and increasing the number of young people exposed to the noise that they generate.
"The scientifiques-conclue executive ue- confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now look at with the member states and other interested parties, what could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable music devices and appliances.
There is already a standard European security, which limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100db, but the concern is growing about the harm hearing that could come from excessive exposure to such sources.
It is possible to limit such data, making use of solutions, such as reducing the levels and the length of exposure to noise.
The scientific committee EU pointed out that users of portable music devices, which are listening to music at full volume (over 89 decibels) for five hours per week, exceeding the limits currently in force on the level of noise as made in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods, are a permanent loss of the hearing after 5 years.
This is 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the u.e.

Obama's first president anti-American. This is why.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second president anti-American.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in part its decisions, destroyed the economy and US were reports (as it has always today, as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam. "
The attacks against Obama are increasing as the date of elections.
A lady of Miami has written on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really culotté: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation which in all five senators, governors and black! "
In fact, it is attacks that do not say much; it is obviously the attacks of nature of race, and do not correspond to the question of all voters: it will be a good President? we have, in addition to the polls, which all say that Obama wins and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is yet to someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper of the Mississippi River, in the South sandpits, wrote an article: once in the cab to vote, we know who the American Patriot will give their vote.
This is that one aspect of the American mindset kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we shall we put the cross, Obama or McCain.
There are people who swear: If Obama wins, we leave the United States.
It never turned up to now, so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winner for Democrats is George Bush.
It was asked to 1500 people: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 per cent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation has lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent back home to the fesses kicks.
In Iraq, 500 soldiers have lost their lives, and Americans have not been forced to do the suitcases.
Despite this, Iraq was, for most of the weakness of Bush.
Who will take the place of George W will take a great stain.

USA, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press is the deletions and many blame the Internet, this "killing" of the paper newspaper.
Five hundred journalists Americans have been arrested by the Pew Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not declared to the value of information, feel less worried about the credibility.
They did not feel isolated as ever.
The problem of American journalists, it is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a model of economic crisis destroyed.
In addition, the losses incurred in the newsroom, in the room where editors working at the Assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be resolved, according to journalists interviewed, if we want the traditional media such as the public, will be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism invades the American journalism.
Six in ten senior executives and journalists newspapers printing are convinced that journalism at national level is pursuing a bad way.
Locally, the group executive is to 65%.
Publication printed against broadcast.
Journalists have not hard to see where is the Web.
The larger homes éditrices work a shift towards internet, seen by many as the 'murderer' paper newspaper.
The "economic pressure" that smell of journalists is increased up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology will "do something good 'for their journalism.
Today, the agreements, the largest in the American journalism is between who run the newsrooms- i.e. the directeurs- and reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at national level, are convinced that the reporters to share their values, while at local level, the percentage goes down to 23%.
For some it is linked to the "safety work."
The directors who are losing their job in the area of 3 years, are of 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are going to 30%.
The 'safe working "at the level staff (our authors, NDR) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists working under contract.
In a nation great as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it is fast becoming an issue to take or leave.
The directors are almost always wages, while the editor can win 10mille dollars per month, besides retirement and the payment of insurance.
On the holiday, the logic is simple: 10 days after the first year, 10 days after the third, up to 15 days at all, past a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, the American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It is the fault of climate.

The elites in danger.
The phenomenon has already shown a few days, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of $700 billion approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans, and still is, more interested to punish Wall Street to save the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that we can confirm that the current crisis divides the Republican party, even more divided between his eve soul East Coast, moderate, support the federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to those of Washington "and the world of finance, powerful, especially in the states of central and southern.
The Soul, which has made to feel a despotic rule with the vote which I mentioned earlier.
But what has been mentioned is only one example of the changes, the big changes that the earthquake ongoing economic pre-announcement or is already running: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not be just that here.
The United States in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena couvés for some time, so that, in the new climate, they solidifient and show.
The first of these phenomena is updating the extraordinary stimulus, the double category etat- sovereign, compared to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of bancaires-financières institutions that have, of course of close relations with abroad, but who, above all, are involved, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in one state.
This creates an immediate political problem for which the rules: it is to say as to respond to the difficulties and the protests of individuals and families who are in addition to an electorate.
In short, the crisis is economically, but politically, it is almost here.
The international policy seems to really out of the game or, did little to say: the evidence is provided by the European Union, which shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, will not decide any common policy.
And so is the government in every state that all are waiting for speeches, plans to rescue and recovery, the new rules, and especially the affection of credits: when you travel through a difficult period, there is that the member who have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources to try to put things in place.
They also possess the necessary resources, and the legitimacy for the use of resources: two priceless, things which no market or international organisation can never have the same way.
This new emphasis of the nation is in perfect harmony with the importance still major economic developments most recent economics tend to give a factor quite linked to this point: the territorial limits.
And, paradoxically, when we were convinced to now be entered in the Kingdom of the network, technology increasingly sophisticated, no equipment, convinced that global finance was now aimed to dominate the world we have found a bat, that our future will have to settle scores more with the things relatively little material such as water, harvest, the oil.
Things that can certainly be transported to a place to another of the Earth, but which are linked to definitively to a restricted area, a territory.
Thus, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards than that which is not, i.e., anyone who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and water.
I come to the second experiment that, however, provides a fracture.
That said territory, state government, inevitably, said political leadership.
The economic crisis seems to produce two phenomena converge.
One side, the conscience of the need objective of authoritarian leadership, the search for someone who will take control of the situation.
The other side, a wave of disrepute to the existing leaderships, species that have proved inadequate and full of grey area.
And furthermore, something even more profound in one sense, even disturbing: a shadow, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries in the West.
This is even more convinced of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of social elites until now to their height, their way to listen and to be, their culture in the acceptance of the complicated term, to have the same time, and to always be more foreign to the views of the majorities.
In short, demand for leadership, fueling below, a powerful and ramifié movement of délégitimassions ruling classes and traditional political orders in the 'revolt' electoral improvised or, in the changes of collective moods of recent very recently, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, in the fall of Labour in Britain, the rebellion of delegates Americans against Bush (and that the victory of the right in Italy is not by chance).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectual accredited, their format, would anyone have more difficulty, which is not starting today, to understand and therefore to represent the deeper layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and wave potentially too much.
At the sight of all this talk of a current rebellion of the masses "on the agenda, is frankly ridiculous.
But it is said, keep our eyes wide open, it is not without reason.

The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Defeating the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue, and in the future, walk on the walls as Spiderman.
This is the aim of various research centres, and today, a team of four institutes almost succeeds.
With a removed was barely 2.5 centimeters square, researchers have succeeded in keeping stuck a corps of 100 kilograms on a vertical walls.
The etude- the American Journal of Science has published the findings of some researchers from University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is one of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called the Nano tubes of carbon.
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes prepared as a pile of spaghetti." says Zhong flax Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the legs of geckos, overlaid hair microscopic which will ensure the animal, a perfect adhérente.
The testing of various materials, such as glass, the téflon, and the paper, glass, have demonstrated that the new removed is ten times more powerful than the legs of the reptiles, and together, that he "stands out easily from the walls," explains Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty of engineering from University of Dayton.
Walk on the walls? – 'this material could be used as temporary removed, "adds Liming Dai.
May be to walk on the walls as Spiderman? may be that yes, but researchers think to use much less compelling as the connection between electronic appliances, given that the Nano tubes of carbon are drivers of heat and electricity.
Other applications could affect the aerospace engineering.
For now, not super heroes.

The Nobel economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel prize for the economy has been attributed to the American Paul Krugman for his research on the models of trade and the location of economic activity.
Krugman, 55, is a néo-keynésien who teaches at the University of Princeton and it is also a famous writer of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest criticism solutions in economy and foreign policy of the Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times, the second event would have been more crucial that the first, in effect in US history.
A prediction which unleashed many controversies, and who was having the economist for years, but which now has proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or WorldCom, have disappeared from public attention," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an economist of great value, "but also a divulgateur in style" very aggressive, especially critical to the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration.

Following a work of almost a year, done by volunteers, patrolled by developers Microsystem sun, the new package open office is the public with several new features: the screen of welcome, and the interface reviewed and become less crude, to other more important, as the compatibility born to the system opératif Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest version ISO standard.
Open Office has been particularly focused on the interaction with the Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx..)
As interesting, certain specific modules, as anyone who can cut the PowerPoint presentations, useful, for example, to send them by e-mail, or import in the queue PDF module to chart, retaining the original aspect of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create PDF documents "hybrid" between the graph typical of the Adobe format to the elements of a piece of calculation or a producer of text.
The collaboration between several people is something that has had various improvements within the applications: in the roadmap calculation, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the changes in the development of texts, because each employee is given a colour of comments for greater recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are working to bring some functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the trail), and in the coming weeks, they should make the final outcome.
The Italian version is déchargeable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the result is as usual available for the system opératif Linux.
At the request, the CDS of installation can be shipped home or in the workplace.
And if the owner can be a way for the spread in the houses, it is precisely in the business, open office the following is the big challenge, can count on various projects in the public administration and schools.
Without mentioning the realities that offer a service of training, advice and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to the future of business.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: writer, for the video writing equivalent of word; CALC, is a calculation that aims to replace excel; impress, for the rival of PowerPoint presentations, dBase, such as the famous access, is the programme that allows us to work on the databases; finally drwa is the module graph.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million download, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely with the release of the new version, we could even exceed the figure predicted

Kohl, is positive is the fourth event of doping.
New cases of positivité at the last Tour de France: the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best grimpeur.
This is the site of The Equipe who reported the news.
To 26ans, Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive Cera EPO, the third generation after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests carried out on the test tubes of Kohl are part of those made in recent weeks in the laboratory in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the against analyses confirm the positivité in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the tour and will have to necessarily expect two years of elimination.
The news of the positivité Kohl in the third generation of EPO was confirmed by the head of the French agency anti doping, Bordry Stone, who has told The Associated Press, have notified the positivité the Austrian authorities.
The Austrian 26ans placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, raflant along the Jersey to the best grimpeur peas.

Immigres: New York Times wonders if Italy is racist?
Italy "as the country of immigrants has recently turned into a destination for immigrants' met with resistance.
This transformerait-il beautiful countries in a nation of racist? it is intéroge the New York Times who has dedicated a long article discussing the subject of racism in Italy, based on the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a boite of biscuits.
This case highlights that the New York Times describes as "the paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where there is "more and more work," but also "a sense anti-immigrés the strongest and most important support to Northern League."
To confirm the increasing tension between Italian and immigrants, the NYT has also refers to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature sought by the Lega Nord to curb immigration and facilitate the return of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trend underlined by the pope as well as president of the republic, "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict on Quirinal, asked what the state and church are working together to overcome racism."
Etudiants victims of the rents, up to 900 euros for a house.
The market of students try to not know of crisis
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the union of tenants, rent a house simple can cost a student, up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very seriously at the point to exclude entire groups of young, the right to the study because of the overall costs so high that families in need soutenir- explains the responsible for the Bureau of studies of Sunia, Laura mariani- in those cities, the strong demand from the students has distorted the market that a process of widespread increase is amorcémême for residents.
In most cases, the tender of rental include a series of violations: contracts free, not made, without limit of rent, sous-locations.
For the Sunia, exceptional measures through the review of taxation, are needed to calm prices.
I read in detail the investigation, we see in Milan, for a bed in the area Brianza, it should be around 450 euros; for a simple, we will at least 650 euros (area gang Nere), an average value of 800 (lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (area Vittoria.)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350 / 400 euros, a house around 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the university, it must be 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a simple.
In Rome, in areas near the Central University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), it takes approximately 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a simple) for the areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save if people living in the outlying areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the area predestina, centocelle or similar.
In Naples, for a bed to 300 / 400 euros, for a simple, spending $400 to 600 euros, with prices higher in areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli aminei.
To read in Bari, there are 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple.
In the smaller towns, where prices are low in absolute terms, but they have an importance in the economy in towns and cities.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which the variation is often taken by students from outside the community, there is an anomaly: the rent later asked foreign students is an increase of 25 / 30% compared to that applied to the Italians.

Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, cities éliment historical rooms.
The historic cinemas are closing in favour of multiplex.
"a city without cinemas is a city blind, it is like a face and eyes."
The image provided by the director Giuseppe Tornatore shows what happens in major cities in Italy, but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalisation of theatres, with the birth on the outskirts of big multisalles, and the death of consomption of Mono rooms in central areas of cities, is one of major events, which is inevitable and intuitive; he has all the characteristics of a real crime, cultural.
To disappear, it is often the historic places and charged with memory, "is as if a friend of mine collapsed, someone is known, with which we have shared a long way and so many emotions" is the orchestrator of the Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, film that offers Tornatore there 20 years, the first Oscar and the high price of the jurée of Cannes, and telling the poetry of a province, and nostalgia for a way to live the cinema, can be lost forever.
The figures provided by ANEC, the Association of Traders, want to say: the last five years, 316 of the traditional kind cinemas were closed, and the rooms of the main towns which have paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan and Rome, Naples, Bologna, 6, at least in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, the Roman Emily is at the top with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by the Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof confirming t that primarily responsible for their demise is the advent of multiplex because of the three Italian regions that have the most new cinemas multisalles: 195 screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as emilie-romagne.
"The Italian exploitation has grown so irrational," observed Paolo Protti, president of the ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would need to ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm in a city, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to multiplex.
Without mentioning the deliberation missed the credit for traders: the debt antécédente state is around 10 million euros.
It is shameful, a point of view étique and moral, the government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the industry, it should be between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation with the signing of a protocol between City Hall and ANEC, the first of this kind in Italy, to protect and promote the cinemas mono rooms of the historic centre and on the outskirts.
Among the prescriptive, there are measures of state tax in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: Viewers will be able to enter the zone restricted traffic, and will have special tariffs for parking spaces and in some parks.
"It is an initiative that I am very fond" note Giuseppe Tornatore 'and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place of other measures.
However, it is clear that, in contrast the superpower of the multiplex rooms, the traditional must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public of today is more demanding.
The defence of the traditional film is an issue for me, has always been important: the closure of the supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do 'new film Paradiso' which I thought already since 10ans.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I turn to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have both experienced emotions shared, I turn on the other side not to see signs noircis by dust.

Links between politics and 'Ndrangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to standardise the choice of the town hall to the interests of the clan Piromalli."
Heavy charges are launched by the anti-Mafia magistrates in the direction of Calabria, the mayor and the vice mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal torrione, as well as Rosario schiavione, and the mayor of rosarno Carlo Martelli's liberal socialists, arrested this morning for externally advertised for Mafia association.
The manettes also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the administrations, and his small son lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted of criminal association of mafia type, and to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to the regulatory and legal and moral sense," write prosecutors, the two local authorities had expressed willingness to pay for consultations to master Piromalli.
"We would have been granted in the clan -écrivent the juges- enter officially inside the halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, control and orientement public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that 'collusions between councils and local organised crime, there are more of a "in its region:" There are places where the Mafia is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there is also a lot of politicians who resist pressure from the Ndrangheta, heroes who are honest. "
The arrests of this morning to follow those of last July, following which the police announced that the Piromalli décapitée clan.
At the end of April, the city council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; back in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organised crime and the local administration, local politicians had been emptied of their duties to administer the city.
Giorgio Dal torrione, mayor of the UDC during the dissolution, had been appointed head of a center-right coalition, after the tie in May 2006.
He shouted to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
It accusa Vice Interior Minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing it of having engineered the first for a political issue, but given the demand for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the clan Piromalli had even managed to ask the variation in the project on the A3.
The interception ordered against Dal torrione, the PM to write, is émergée 'willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a group more experienced, close to the Piromalli, unifying the choice of public administration to the interests of the clan.

When the energy is born of waves, now the big moves.
This is a huge source with over 70% of the size of the planet and now the big global companies are being discovered.
Currents and waves and tides, the new renewable sources on which the behemoths such as Chevron have asked me, and now are trying to put together.
The possibility of energy from the movement of the sea is considered for now a hundred years, and in the 1970s alongside the first oil crisis, the research have intensified.
When oil prices lowered to 1980, the idea of exploiting the marine energy was sidelined, but now the environmentalists and the new increase in oil to give a big rise in the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London ruled in 2007, only 15% of worldwide need electricity could be covered by operating systems of the Houle seas.
That amount would be twice the size that produce the nuclear power stations.
And there would be the currents and the tides.
Behemoths in the attack.
The first company to focus on energy navy has been the Enersis, who in 2005, has siglé an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, not a true revolutionary.
Two years ago, still more candidates from these companies destined always to the traditional energy is banking on marine energy.
"Chevron is studying the technology on energy océanique- said the spokesman of a company associated with the American Idol tanker, the daily economic Wall Street Journal- and evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us".
Cooperation in question, is a deliberate enabled by the US Commission on the energy needed to give rise to a marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting, especially if you consider that in Alaska, the US continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. In New York and ocean power of New Jersey, who travel the route of energy from the sea, and the amount invested until today, although their details are known, according to observers, a growing interest.
Tecnologie to point.
The experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, from the fact that energy Navy did not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems like those of Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create big problem in the ecosystem.
To produce energy, however, it must use of technology with an environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: ocean power, for example, uses a system to extend connected to each other.
The waves, which moves the sludge to the high and low water pressure is converted into the Pistons and cylindres inside the cork.
The pressure has been a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Energy is sent to the side through cables under sailors.
For now, we have four systems such as project, in anticipation of a single federal approval and part of energy could be used to a military installation.
Verdant Power, instead, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six turbines in the Marines of the East River in New York.
The movement of water at the tides, runs the turbines pales, creating a rotational movement which feeds into a generator.
Verdant said it had a long list of customers waiting permission to draw energy.
After the waves, tides.
Special interest, they say at the Institute for Research of electricity, worth at this time, the potential of the tides.
Although it is intermittent, the oil is more predictable wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
And it is precisely the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look to the coasts, have invested $ 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and will invest up to 35 million in 2009.

The bennes sorting of waste are not the perfume to Brno
À Prague everyone can select its packaging of drinks, while in the villages of south Moravia you fall on bennes sorting on every street corner.
And in Brno?
Here, we need you to take several minutes before finding the bennes adequate.
I do not mean that we do not trierait waste to Brno.
But I have the impression that the councillors in our city, the second largest city, is not interested enough in this problem.
Brno in the stone age of the sorting of waste not only because people cannot even select the paper, glass and PVC, but especially because many of bennes devoted to these waste.
Have you tried to lay a plastic bottle in the downtown?
It is a science, which requires above all the time and nerves of steel.
The only place that I found at the moment that is the place of Moravia, in front of potrefena Husa.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues do not want, but it seems sacrément little.
Without mentioning the fact that in other parts of the city that is not easy either.
And finally, many of my friends Trient their waste.
For laziness.
Ça their one is actually going on to get the bennes.
Ça does not surprise me from them.
I, after a festival, I have offered to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I saw no benne colour Street kounicova.
Fortunately I found the place to take the tram.
That said, the waste were full to overflowing.
This is after all the centre of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best city, no?!
This is probably that ecology and the alleged esthétisme are not too many of the Socialists in Brno.
They prefer to buy at the city a place in the first league hockey is a disgrace to the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few extra bennes and provide the sort of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad to have been able to consolidate my impression with official statistics after having taken a moment on the Internet.
According to data from the company eko-kom, Brno really is the worst of the whole region south Moravia.

The budget of Paroubek claimed the argentaux pensions to holidays disease.
After the left has increased, despite the government, farmers and officials there may lack money for pensions, the disease or savings housing.
But also for interest on debt État or judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says the finance minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for spending, pensions or leave. "Ça does that put the problems in later, undermine the ground," said Janota.
It is on borrowed money to pay the interests of more expensive and will need to be back sooner or later.
The État did not actually the choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its spending, it will raise taxes.
À all those that the left has now risen: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And then in their children.
The people will and should not fear for their pensions or their health insurance, which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater indebtedness of the État - next year it will therefore not 163 billion into the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of the minister Janota debt is growing faster and faster and with it, the expenses related to the interests.
The État will need money for the repayer and it does more to increase slightly VAT or reduce the maternity leave as the government in its anti-déficit package.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to groups of voters.
It is mainly sections and started already decided that it is not possible to change the projects to reduce possibly costs.
To keep them, which is not cheap either.
This means delaying or stop 30 major sites, and the removal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning Karel hanzelka, spokesman of the ministry of transport.
The Čssd has proposed to solve the financial deficit very subtly - it will draw from the dividend for Čez (producer and distributor of electrical energy), that the État has in bulk and add to the transport fund.
The concern is that the dividend is never certain and that it is in no way a Puit without substance.
Last year, 18 billion that was navigués since the Čez until the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay the removal of environmental damage, to supplement the accounts of pensions or even serve for the pension reform.
Moreover, this device increases the real deficit of the budget of up to 5.7 per cent of GDP in the EU rules.
And it is far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensation to victims of Communism and crimes, or even savings housing, fell by nearly three billion.
It is not certain that the État can act without this money.
This is a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we must in any way the pay, Janota.
The minister will then save the side of the department or, in the worst case, involving the government's budget.
It also lacks a hundred million in cash to État worth two billion, which can go online, what are spending every administration.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project must be stopped and sanctions would take place, warns Janota.

The lack of snow in the mountains bothers the hotel
The courses are deserted pose no problem and operators of remonte-pentes.
The lack of snow deters people to book their stays on skiing in hotels and pensions.
Thus, it is always possible to get rid of Chambers free for all the dates in winter, including Christmas and new year.
We have plenty of hits on our site.
Internet users travel offers, asking prices, but dare not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if they call, they call immediately if there is snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin jandura, operator of the spindl.info information portal.
If you want to spend New year of his dreams to Špindlerův mlýn, better not too hesitant to reserve.
If you give priority to economies and that the quality of accommodation is that, then we can try to wait a few days.
The hotel to Špindler did not propose for the moment of visits a week for new year.
I think they will try again for a moment of the place, but they cèderont them and will accept a shorter period.
And then the number of free rooms will soon fall, "said jandura.
The agency of tourism ingtours of vrchlabí also proposes more beds free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas is the most for the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, say, half the houses in our offer.
This is why we have already prepared a last-minute stays of Christmas, "said the director of ingtours Schiefert Petr.
The agency vrchlabí tourism can also offer the new year to krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
The 14 days of February are just as well, stays hivernaux remaining sell moderately.
This year, interest in the winter visits has been negatively influenced by the fact that there has still not of snow to krkonoše.
The people expect that it began to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert.
À the opposite, the occupation of the hotel horizont to PEC pod sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of almost five per cent.
We have few places for the new year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holiday in January of Poles and February sells well, too, "advised Karel Rada, director of the best hotel of Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the Central Park jánské lázně is also full of 80 per cent during the period on new year.
Instead, half of the beds remain empty for Christmas in the latest jánské lázně hotel.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already 60 per cent of occupation at the moment.
February is a little more low for now, but as soon as the snow is falling, the interest for stays in the krkonoše builds certainly still said the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik sporysch.
The hotel of krkonoše should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be fresher and rainfall, they should be neigeuses in the mountains.

États-unis repetition is the mother of wisdom.
It is even comical, painstaking effort with President Barack Obama to the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on Afghanistan, that he regarded himself as so simple.
When he eventually left to reflect its doctrine supporter, it transpired that he had recopiée paper carbon from the Iraqi scenario Bush for three years ago.
Not content to use in the text itself several times "as in Iraq," he has not hesitated, which is more, to use the title of the speech by Bush in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "a new way forward."
Meanwhile, he has personally criticised the idea of Bush to send reinforcements in a new Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following months have shown that Bush's strategy, which was issued recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success so the headlines today do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, he left his successor a final situation far more favourable than anyone could hope.
Barack Obama hope in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It is once again the commanders of campaigns, who asked him to an increase in military contingent, including the commander of the operation in Afghanistan, General Stanley mccristal, which was severely criticised the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 to make the situation more favourable.
The president has hesitated for three months but if a better option, at least he had cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He has managed to stamp out the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it was home to 10,000.
Which makes the most problems throughout the Obama strategy seems to be its intention to withdraw troops to Afghanistan by 18 months and to finish this process in three years ago. The doctrine of Obama leads to more questions than it does not provide answers.
Many have doubts about the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out for the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and any treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces, used to change of leader day to day according to what suits them.
The political institutions, although based officially, will in the pan behind which will increase the patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly difficult to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
Even the foundation of a 'state quick to act ", which is the aim of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time of the strategy Obama makes puzzled by his determination.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and out of the reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent to the tumult of the war in order to their "speedy return to the House" will bring a miracle.
Politically, setting a date for withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible since the Taliban see it as the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that Europeans want to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving to negative.
European politicians do not know or do not want to tell their constituents what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor is capable of altering radically the situation is the development of events linked to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that sanctions strengthened should not have effects on the Iranians, Americans will face the very difficult question of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will the victorious withdrawal of troops to Afghanistan.
Each solution to this kind will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only swept for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time to go on a new strategy in case it would be revealed to be a flop.

However, the parliament has approved Wednesday the proposals from the left on the transfers of money and increased the amount of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of Social Democrats is that they would increase by passing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between left and the government, Klaus and the right to disagree that calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer was formed by agreement between the ODS, the Čssd and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as it was voted by members, removes the package of saving measures passed by the government of Fischer and according to stem the indebtedness of the État.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the budget of the État but that nothing forces, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the irréfrénable "deficiency" of public finances.
À now there is, according to him, no solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if he could rely on a consensus of political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is amazing and that the government should call into question its existence further.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr nečas told the Čtk that the idea of a Cabinet official supported by the Čssd, the ODS and the greens is clearly more.
In his reaction, the Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic" verdicts.
The head of Čssd jiří Paroubek reacted with Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by former government of Topolánek is amazing and it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the Čssd called a success the ratification of the budget for the État for the next year.
The People's Party was also pleased.

The story about sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
American actor Morgan Freeman, rewarded the Oscars, embodies the film on the lives of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said that it is a Mandela Ninety-one years old who asked him to the flesh in the film.
Matt Damon plays another role.
I told him: 'If I want you to embody, I should be able to see you personally.
The actor who is 72 years which has been rewarded for a price for his role in the drama milion dollar baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery itself servant, a US president, the shadow, even in the film Evan Almighty God, but never someone alive and as important for so many people as Mandela.
The ex-homme of État South Africa has been jailed 27 years for his hard work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
It was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years ago.

The mystery of the will in Norway is resolved the Russians testaient a rocket.
There has been a strange phenomenon ring of unknown origin above Norway.
The Ministry of Defence Russia has recognised that yesterday to have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic missile, not far from the borders from Norway.
The launch, however, has been a failure and the missile "Bulava" which was originally scheduled for the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence is repeated in the tests of the rocket has not had the effect on the success of flights.
Most of the time is Bulava has not disappeared, or it was damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as the "missile that not."
A missile that is not
The 13th test took place at the beginning normally.
Ça is only at the end of the flight that there was again the damage to equipment.
This is clearly the driving force behind the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" has disappeared from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be rightly torched a boat in movement and immergée
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object exactly has probably been by a "Bulava" flawed.
The rest, the Norwegians have not doubted a moment that this is a Russian rocket.
The generals to argue that this time, we cannot talk absolutely of failure.
The two first floors of the rocket has resisted and the damage has hit the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have been failures on the first floor.
Even if none of the test launches has gone smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence think that only six to 13 have been failures.
The success rate of almost 50 per cent fills the generals of optimism and they say is always a day "Bulava 'fly without problems and that it will even ten nuclear cores hypersoniques a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The leadership of the Hyundai plant in nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is because of overtime frequent the trade unions have declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr vaněk plant Hyundai has confirmed.
The leadership wants to be put even agree with the unions on a Saturday job this year.
We cannot abandon our plan of production, it is important, this is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing that there would have two teams, said vaněk.
The site sedmička.cz has indicated that the company has offered a bonus 400 Czech crowns for employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be awarded has also afterwards for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for hours.
Or they receive the extra for hours, or they can put a leave of replacement on 28 December and extend their new year celebrations aindiqué vaněk.
In addition to that all employees here on Saturday will receive compensation for the transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that the extra hours were the most urgent and the warmer in the comments and the demands of unions and employees who have voluntarily stopped production in the last week, the management has taken the decision to cancel all overtime for December, said vaněk.
Until last week, employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in most of their eight hours.
The unions will cancel the state to strike after signing the agreement.
The following negotiations between the leadership of the car factory and the unions should take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader Petr kuchař said Wednesday that they were prepared to stop the state to strike in the event on their demands and signing a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers have begun spontaneously on strike because of continuous hours.
They were protesting against the poor conditions of pay and so-called bizutages.
The leadership fought with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to fill the imperatives of production of cars.
During the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions have also asked for employees who have stopped production are not subject to sanctions.
The trade unions demand for society to reduce the time spent in overtime.
They want this year a reward of 5,000 about €kroner (209) for them.
The car plant Hyundai of nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It began series production last year in November.
It has produced approximately 80,000 vehicles up to September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.

The Czech discovery: a substance that works on the HIV virus as "hard-working people."
A team of scientists Czech and German is testing new combinations that could slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantages of the substance improved is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to medicines.
This is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as hard on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
Nevertheless, we can prolong radically changed the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
The result, however, a number of side effects.
The repression of this increase for the development of so-called virus strain on which drugs do have more effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the vŠcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way in a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are a patchwork of boron, carbon and hydrogen, cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all the medicines used to date and therefore they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved" on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their routes on the proteins of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-step structure: two cages in the walls are trained by the atoms boron, hydrogen and carbon and connected by an atom, in this case cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
The protéase HIV is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the protéase HIV there would not rise of mature infectious particles from the virus.
If you stop the protéase HIV, it will stop the spread of virus in the body of the patient, say researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochimie Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a number of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short link, which is then systematically altered.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the protéases HIV has been tested in test tubes and its variations resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as clinical medicine, but it is not diminishing the versions resistant against which the current medicines are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other changes chemical compounds are so interesting to examine more to move towards the development of effective medicines against HIV, says pavlína Řezáčová, director of the Laboratory of structural biology, the Institute of organic chemistry and biochimie and the Institute of molecular genetics to the Academy of Sciences.

Dispute over the budget. The ODS is the Fischer, who denies
The president of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called "amazing" the budget approved for next year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer would threaten its existence.
The prime minister described the connection of the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyse.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr nečas said that the idea of a Cabinet official supported by the Čssd, the ODS and Green Party did not clearly.
According to nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend at the House of Representatives support on the minority who cares to combat the ballooning deficit, or if he cares to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats compared to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified on Wednesday the budget for 2010, with the proposed changes to the tune of approximately 12 billion included in the left.
The House has increased the money for salaries of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The complaint of the government against the proposals of Social Democrats was the fact that they have increased by passing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, obedient and the desire of the government as a modified budget is a variant less bad than a budget.

# lang=en docid=280 origlang=fr system=moses corpus=potet type=MT
That disappointment.
The finance minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, the Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took meeting Monday with Prime Minister after its passage in government.
He said while he wondered if it would remain in office.
His disappointment about the budget negotiations is the reason.
While Fischer decides to continue the fight against the budget deficit, nečas believes that representatives of the Čssd, which have forced changes to the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he quit if the Congress ratifies the other laws, increasing the deficit, such as those that affect the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the head of government Fischer and all the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing wrong Topolánek, said in a statement from the États-unis text.
He pointed out that the deputy ministers from some ministries to claim top 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the fight against the amount of public finance deficit, "it is entirely logical and reasonable that it is based on the majority of the left which is currently in the house."
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I was not considered and that it will be on the agenda and I will, said since the House to journalists, Defense Minister Martin barták elected government precisely with the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has increased in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came back to the prime minister.
Nečas stressed that the ODS probably would have voted on Wednesday against the budget changes if he did not explicitly asked the House Democrats to vote on the budget.
We do not have the feel of orphans, there is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been accusations from the president of the party in the house or in the country in negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that would follow in the months would be a bolchévisation house and destruction of all that was positive, sprung Topolánek in person.

The history of South Africa for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood movie of Clint Eastwood arrives in American cinemas in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official title Czech Invictus: neporažený), and narrae part of life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of fighting against apartheid world-famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who has been chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, the return of critics and the public can be heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela, it was born on 18 June 1918 to mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he has achieved the Sakharov Prize for his freedom, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
It was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations as it is presented at a time when part of South Africa is in full preparations for the football World Cup, and because the media are troubled by disturbing news about the rise of racial conflict and discrimination of the inhabitants of the part of the black majority in power.
According to the agency Pa, reactions to the new film is at the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the principal roles where "pavanent" of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, taking its own terms, proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover his energy, he said during the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if you have the opportunity to remind themselves through the film the personality and the message of Nelson Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it affects each individual, he added.
Wear the jersey of the national team rugby
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room which has given its creation to the people depicted the defender South African human rights during his term of presidency.
Morgan Freeman is trying to during the film to pick up two racial groups of people long divided and even that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between Jersey, dressed in the national team of South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup, South Africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn in Jersey, which is seen in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been widely cheered fourteen years, mainly from the public White and has been recognised by the white population.
Hope that the Football Championship will be able to unite people once again as one nation, said the player of the rugby Chester Williams, who was in 1995, the only 'black' of the national team.
It remains to see if the tense situation of South Africa will improve.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical as recently confided in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, fan of rugby that has fled to Britain.

Similarly, he said have evidence that no region has been in agreement with the European law.
We are preparing for that a complaint to the European Commission.
Švejk ’ consider filing a complaint from Mr jančura represents the continuation of its media spectacle of free publicity for his company and for him.
Of course I am prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and the other chiefs to do likewise.
I assume that this will be the opportunity to show clearly that it is Mr jančura who manipulate public opinion and is using the false and misleading arguments about the regional rail transport, says švejk ’
Jančura has already been informed last week that it will invest a few million kronor in an advertisement which will include the steps against the regions.
He said to radiožurnál that it will stop the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the new year.
He said that the campaign will target the corruption at large.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to give the railways Czechs exploitation of rail links to a command of about 150 billion kronor, without bidding.
According to jančura, to do so is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to jančura threats of a member of the Čssd.
The only threat was that if it does not stop, you could lose our licences to buses.
He presented himself as a member of the Čssd, I do not know who it is but I would not say his name, said jančura today at radiožurnál.

The vaccination against the pneumocoques will be free and voluntary
The vaccination against the pneumocoques overturn the current old habits in January.
It will be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
The voices, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of vaccination, free of charge against the pneumocoques culminent.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already defines the maximum price for vaccines that will pay the health insurance.
Experts are also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against the pneumocoques charge.
The condition is that they have not been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay yourself the following vaccination.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated children against the pneumocoques.
Yet parents footed 1,600 kroner, or more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 million kronor in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that children would not vaccinated.
Until now the État spending about 500,000 kronor a year for any vaccination for children.
The vaccination repaid was introduced with the "package Janota."
The pneumocoques are the cause of sore from the middle ear but also serious infections whose inflammations of méninges and poisoning of blood.
According to surveys in hospitals, until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by infections pneumocoques.
À from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid.
Vaccination will be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible mandatory vaccination in the future.
À from January, it must be regulated by the insurance and voluntary.
For example, president of the Association nahlas Rudolf kalovský has indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
The Association promotes long vaccination against the pneumocoques.
In an international conference in which our Association took part, experts have not been really happy that we have a voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
Furthermore, we are pleased to have been able to impose this much.
I think it is a direction that we now need to follow, said kalovský.
But the health ministry does not change the process of vaccination against the pneumocoques.
We are definitely not for the moment, said spokesman Vlastimil sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana cabrnochová, president of the company specialised paediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, it could consider a reduction in times of vaccinations in the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination, "said, however, cabrnochová.
Experts estimate that next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their babies.
The vaccination against the pneumocoques marks a break because it is the first vaccination in children, which is funded by insurance and not the État.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance companies should free up funds for the prevention, they économiseraient and on any future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This is linked to the concerns of paediatricians practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy the vaccines by insurers, doctors receiving the same way that other products of vaccine made by the État.
Some members feared that this would allow insurance companies to deduct the money for health insurance. "
Thus, doctors will have to buy the insurance products and expect them to repay.
According to estimates, the individual paediatricians will invest nearly 40,000 kroner per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
Ça will not be easy, according to cabrnochová.

Labour is defending the increase in tax.
Ministers have defended the increase in tax and spending cuts announced in the report of pré-budget, despite the criticism of the opposition, the companies and unions.
The Tories have said that Alistair Darling has "failed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor has also incurred in dealing with low wages and salaries.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% of the social insurance and a cap of 1% on the public wages from 2011.
The anger of the social insurance
The unions protested that the low salaries are being penalised by a recession that they are not responsible and have warned that "problems" has warned.
The loss of insurance sociale- who will get about £3 billion per year - has put the business world, angry, because he is a tax on jobs when the goal should be a recovery.
The increase, for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
Major points of the report of pre-Budget
The social insurance will rise again by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall encoreplus the 4.75% expected this year.
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The surtax on the benefits of society to small firms has been abandoned
Tax rebate of electric cars of wind turbines.
Increasing the retirement of 2.5%
According to estimates of the Treasury, one winner 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and one winner in 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while one winner 10,000 GBP per year will gain 110 GBP.
Ministers have said that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 entrainait "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, Treasury secretary, has brought an increase in tax and pointed out that cutting spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will enable us to halving the deficit, which will be crucial over four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident and that economic growth redémarrerait at the end of this year.
However, forecasts of the Labour Party on economic growth - which will affect the amount that it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - have been put in doubt after the Chancellor has been forced to revise its initial figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably 4.75% this year – far worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP over the prior estimate.
"missed opportunity"
The Conservatives who will launch this Thursday, a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of Labour, have argued that the project to borrow £no 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to pay off, they added, dodged "cynical" difficult decisions until after the elections - which must be held in June 2010.
"They have not produced significant on what they would do", said Philip Hammond, Treasury chief secretary of the shadow cabinet. "they had the opportunity to do it and they have missed."
"The major announcements will be made after the election, whoever the winner."
Roger Bootle Deloitte.
The Labour insists that the schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further cuts, unlike the Tory proposals that would lead to a more rapid and more of the deficit.
But the Lib Dems have argued that the money due to increases in taxes and reduced costs would be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on the wind '.
Nick Robinson, editor of the BBC, said that the timing of announcements, such as rising inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned ci-dessus- would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, the money simply being retrieved the next year.
However, lelabour insists that extra support is provided when people are most in need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"false budget."
Although ministers have not published the details of spending beyond 2011, economists have argued that it was clear that the restrictions in public expenditure would begin to bite in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Institute of Fiscal Studies (Western) said that the figures from the Chancellor, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is in fact that delayed," said its director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the election, whoever the winner," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte accountancy.
"This was a false report of pré-budget. The markets are going well."

Amnesty condemns the Iranians' abuse '
The last twenty years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to the report of the Association Amnesty International.
The report presents "repeats of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
A man named in the report asserted that it had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the previous criticism about its human rights.
The authorities have said that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the election dispute of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison and prosecutors say that at least five people were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of protests, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the detention centre of Kahrizak.
But since then, the authorities have tolerated any criticism, said our correspondent.
"a false confession."
Amnesty International has told the case of a student in computer 26 years, Ebrahim mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of working with the networks of Facebook "and have protested against the election results.
"They have often in the face," he was named.
"I have been burned with cigarettes under the eyes, on the neck, head... they have threatened to execute and humiliated".
After five days, it has signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and a half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others have been violated.
The Iranian authorities have denied the accusations of rape but admitted that the abuse had taken place.
Amnesty has also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has accepted that the Iranian parliament and judiciary to create a committee to investigate the unrest post-élections and the government's response, but she claimed that the mandate and the powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group has said that at least 90 people were arrested during the last three weeks ago in order to prevent further demonstrations.

Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle Deloitte.
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, 'why the French do not like the headscarf "(2006), a study elegant and well documented on a problem that has divided and worried the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book of Mr Bowen presents a web of broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, it would not only know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and colleges which are now in France this Quem. Bozen calls "Muslim" spaces for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well to listen and replicate the debates between teachers and pupils on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim must marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
The development and gay rights should be taught the young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-musulman?
A Muslim could use a banking system based on the interests for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the everyday life, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, unknown to the public, except, perhaps, Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of Islam as French or European.
The scholars and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia which of our days are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
I Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the religion of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite Guardian if muscle-flexing of Secularity) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to be historic compromises with the secular Republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of the core values".
Islam can be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."

The view the darkest of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
That made up the ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas shipments and fishing are in new waters open, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrateur, painted a natural history of the symbol of the North, the polar bears.
Knowledge of history and complicated political allowing whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were doing their evidence in the white bear hunting.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, courageous yearning for 14 years ago which had to fight the tip of his mousquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young oursons, captured when they nageaient alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early twentieth century, a famous was 75 bears.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface for an adult in liberté. climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green as a result of algae that drove in his thick fur.

Mr Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by the hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, in America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters by helicopter and the Inuits in motoski use of powerful fusilsd' assault to drive their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters further north of the two nations of the hunt for the ice will stay longer.
In his new book, "after the ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor in New Scientist, offers a clear summary and frightening to the science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor the océanographes cannot spot the exact speed of change.
It is not due to try.
Late nineteenth and early 20th, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of polar ice.
The submarines of the cold war then mapped changes in sous-celle-ci relief.
The surveillance satellites and the sondes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of work is done by men hardened, camping in the cold.
Mr Anderson looking at the World extraordinary and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice formed by the nets of brackish water pressure by freezing.
But the bear mentioned above the microscopic marvels contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the demise of the ice, scheduled for 2013 and 2050.

The first class de' Angello Robinson, 19 years, has made a trip to seven hours by bus to lay a wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson to Jacksonville in North Carolina at the cemetery Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to welcome the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months where we will be sent, we will be for them, said Robinson of the fallen soldiers.
If it happened, I want someone to do the same thing for me is why I try to show respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be assembled on Saturday morning to submit kronor on the graves of veterans, in various sections of the cemetery of Arlington ceremony.

A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US citizen who was being distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the foreign ministry.
The National, which has not been identified, working for development of alternative Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, trying to access the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific allegations were not made public, although under the law of Cuba, a Cuban citizen or a visitor can be arrested under the pretext to be 'dangerous'.
All the self-styled revolutionary activities, including protests moderate and writings criticism, the risk of arrest.
The graffiti anti-gouvernementaux and speeches are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers higher, led by Yoani Sánchez, commentatrice popular who writes frequently on the way are husband and it is monitored and harassed by the government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive prizes but authorisations have always been refused.
The detention of a US citizen may increase the tension between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration is pursuing a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times, on Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as release political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the US to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba, although it is of consumer goods and new wanted in a country or the average wage of a civil servant is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are used primarily for text messages or for a conversation about 15 minutes a day of earnings.
On the island, using the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in the luxury hotels and visitors in the country and in some buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must supply their name in government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, keen to press the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- providing free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas Program of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a report with the freedom to Cuba, called "new Castro, Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested and imprisoned in the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be policy and that the Cuban government is often a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries are beginning to get a better dialogue.

The Pakistani authorities will prevent a plot to send troops in Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have noticed an organisation supposed to prepare a plan to send five men in Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped it would demonstrate a significant network of terrorist recruiters of plundering the Internet in search of young men radicalized.
Investigators have said they were chasing a personality insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah which invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them made comments approving the waves terrorists on the video site YouTube on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to join the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the secret services in Pakistan that has been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had not managed to convince the commanders of the al Qaeda that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
So they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, banned from the mountains northeast become a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered agents infiltrated.
This is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that men were determined and they are still trying to obtain the necessary permissions for entry into the camps of Al Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important in determining the people who trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the American intelligence services have priority to infiltrate the men in the network al Qaeda.
The recruiters to play the role of gardes-barrières, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can prove to be spies.
According to analysts, the American potential recruits are being studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive for the group because of their access to American targets, and the value propagandaire.
However, Evan Kohlmann expert from the foundation NEFA based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also do more and more attention in recent years in the choice of people that they accept as the American intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow its model of recruitment that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is on the Internet.

Inside the palace of Congress, the people were gathered around television screens to follow the lead throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that demonstrators have failed to revive the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China on climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he said in English ", in fact, this is something I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "the event is important, I cannot hear what happens outside".
He observed that the march could be harmful or useful, according to the prospects.
It shows the interest of the public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
Furthermore, 'You can also say they disrupt the talks or they are damaging to the freedom of others. "

The federal report last week on the results in maths has made a good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the district is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress in the last two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (national assessment of progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and white, both local and national.
The results means children whites of Grade 4 (CM1) to washingtond.c. have risen over the past two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their comrades class African-American increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The gap in achievement has actually risen between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (fourth) remains generally steady, falling just one point of 245 to 244.
The result means the White has not been included in the test results because the sample was not important enough.
The survey over a period of six years is not encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 (CM1), when the first report NAEP district was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference is only just 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the head of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were powered by the white students who were already good things.
It would mean that we have high the gathering in the elements on the high costs, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of D.C. voice, a non-profit group that defends the equality in education in the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), a member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter was in grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the style of management of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city are desperate for attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs, and I respect him.
But what is frightening is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the district should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading system, which the pupils of classes to end the cycle and early college who have not included the foundations of the Reading earlier in their school career and who are lagging behind their peers.
Every day, the programme of mathematics, for kindergarten classes (Mother) to grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and the experiences of real life, such that they have been put in place in the district by the former head Clifford Janey must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply do not believe that we must continue to work to provide better interventions with these pupils of lower level than the class, said Rhee.
Others argue that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with fewer good results in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of Berkeley in California who studied the results of tests of the cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to the schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting can have repercussions policies that stand in this important program.
But the problem, of course is that as the other superintendant schools, it is trying to use the middle class whites and blacks.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our school districts, so that all families regardless of where they originate, should be confident that their children can get an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendant schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success étaitla duration of traditional public school today, 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with the charter schools.
It should get about 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, that it considers a "starting point" to achieve an increase in the next contract.

To make higher education, a promise of future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long sifflement.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years ago in fall and cligne one point of view at the sight of columns, facades of bricks and leafy grasslands.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to complete high school, àel El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, which was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and other students in Grade 8 (fourth) of the group tried Gettysburg where school fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less than a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
This is where I am going to study! has noted Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guides the headed towards the entrance of the building of science.
Youpi, really? they songeuse when he made the low ratio professor of law student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that were visiting children during their journey of discovery of three days and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university.
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who have left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from the university system that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at the school -- a notable success if you think that both of their parents, immigrants, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having completed the school.
Their success is important, say researchers, they open the way generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
The researchers who study fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high to their children and who are finding ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with the American schools.
The programmes of mentorat also play a very important role to help Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university -- especially if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied Latin American students.
We must think to offer a support network for these children from kindergarten through high school.
The federal program, which funded the visit of the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the ERG up (prépares you), it provides more than $300 million per year to systems of local schools to organise programmes in preparation for the university started when students from families on low incomes are in middle school (College) and continue until the end years of school.
Since 1999, the programme was followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent going to university, according to the Department of Education.

The Ministry of Iraqi oil has agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements brokered by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with the foreign oil companies suggests that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry in Iraq, quashed by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies are reparties with participation in just two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only had set an auction has lost.
Two American companies have received contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies are of Asian and European companies, paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer was made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, on the massive coordinated bombings Tuesday and political instability, while the US military troops withdraw have slowed down the American oil companies, preventing them to go with more force in Iraq has the third largest oil reserve, gross of the world, say analysts.
The American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, including the cost of labor were significantly lower, which were more prepared to take risks because they had not to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the ministry.
The American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong links with the Iraqi oil ministry and have made their technical advice, are reparties empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more enchéri on contracts that other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam jihad, spokesman for the oil ministry.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The company to submit pré-sélectionnées auctions have made offers which were then compared the price per barrel as the ministry has agreed to pay for the production above current levels for each area.

One of the main organisers of Al Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile has struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organisers of the operations of al-Qaida, this week, said Friday the American authorities of counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this autumn.
Al-somali Saleh was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of rockets fired into their car, on Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said the missiles were fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was struck, said a member of the Secret Service Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone to Miran Shah.
The authorities have said that the local militant suspects ran on and were quickly captured what was left "bodies completely blown apart".
It was impossible to local authorities to check the identity of the victims, but the two representatives anti-terror Americans unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the military responsible organizers who ran Al Qaeda terrorist operations of the group out of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to hold of plots in the world, said one of the authorities who requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this was probably the conspiracies of attacks against the US and Europe.
It has followed the instructions of great leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority has said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-qaida' and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known as the public, but it does not diminish the threat that it is for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second figure of al-Qaeda or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack has killed Najmuddin jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, and three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by the probing Israeli unmanned CIA has fallen since the summer, about six operations for months to two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a website tempered by a non-profit group.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have moved to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly informants suspected, says the site.

The UN special envoy to Kabul to cut
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy has said he supported the increase, but he expressed his concern about the timing of the US for a withdrawal of troops who would start in 18 months and that would force the other governments of NATO to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, sending the wrong signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, said Eide in a telephone conversation in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but that he would follow the commitment that he had made to his family, in March, not to spend two years ago in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said it was better start to look for my successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there had been a gap of two months between the start of my predecessor and I arrived.
According to representatives of the UN, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
Officials say that the name Staffan di Mistura has been quoted; it is a citizen italo-suisse recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September, President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and hide the evidence of a massive vote fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- which has been thanked -- "have damaged the mission because there was already a healthy dose of skepticism regarding the international observation of éléctions."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to co-ordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the US and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in the way their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulation of recruitment of the UN gênaient opportunities to bring new talent.
The rules are such that I was unable to recruit one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.

Gates: Iran must undergo further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "serious additional sanctions on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking at a forum of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit from a week in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of in such an outcome.
One of the things that I choose the most is that if I learned a thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has said that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that a "package of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer greatly on these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement of the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face the consequences "probable" if it does not reduce its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience in a peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks, on October 1, he said it would take the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of its stock of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement means to develop a confidence on both sides and win time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be removed the attempts of agreement, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think the inflexibility of Iran with some of the international community where they had in fact agreed at the beginning in October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join on what they had not considered, in terms of serious additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31, as the deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before he turns to other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'increased sanctions ".
In a statement on Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran in the United Nations condemned what it calls "the allegations baseless" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and said that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to get a long-term satisfactory solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington late on Friday, met this morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region in order derencontrer Kurdish leaders of troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
The tensions persist between Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly on the borders, property rights and the share of income.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid delays of American plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 thousand to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to ease the anxiety of Kurds to withdraw pending. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will protect your security, prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
You will not leave. "

In China, a change of direction ageing
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by displays of propaganda, "the preaching to the Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby, it is a grave and more."
They have so far learned the lesson that the authorities of the government of Shanghai, raised by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more of a child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: Never.
We have already given all of our time and all our energy to one child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31 years ago, director of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good joues and spoiled, dubbed the "Little Emperors', a crisis of the population is threatening the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple for six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, although it is envisaged that the number of residents of 60 years and bursts of 16.7 percent of the population by 2020 to 31,1 percent by 2050. This figure is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
That imbalance is even worse in the coastal cities rich with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai city population and family planning commission (Committee of the population in Shanghai and family planning) said that the fertile couples to have babies to 'help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of labor in the future ".
Shanghai is about to become "too old - but not as rich, however - that the developed countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual reduction
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is undoubtedly the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government.
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and to suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for human rights have denounced the abuse in implementing this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced the pregnant women to a second child to have abortions.
Moreover, many couples have resorted to selective abortions, leading to a ratio of boys, girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have given more exceptions to the rule -- including the residents of towns, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already children unique -- and in 2007, they have toned down much of their slogans.
Xiaochun Qiao, a professor at the Institute of Population Research Institute of Research on the population), at Beijing University, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such that allow couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai, became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage the births.
In no time, the posters urging families to have a single child have been replaced with copies of regulations retailer that has the right to have a second child and how do the authorization request.
The government of the city sent from the family planning and volunteers to meet with couples in their home, and slip the prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to take more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing answer
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai, say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting to a second child following the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The common huinan, with a population of 115 million inhabitants, for example, receives four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be around 165 thousand -- slightly higher in 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, responsible for the committee of family planning in the municipality of caolu in Shanghai, said that the financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to cater to their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, have said they adoreraient having two children and that they are legally allowed.
But as many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Westerners wrongly that the one-child policy is a problem of rights, said Yang, an engineer in construction, whose wife is seven months pregnant the first child.
This is true, we just lucky to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
This is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, chief human resources, said she wanted an only child because it was a itself. "we were the centre of the family and had used that everyone is looking to us."
We were not used to take care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen zijian, 42 years and owner of a society of translating the said more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle class, which are lower birth rates, he says, it must be selfish pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years ago, grew up seeing their parents fight in the first time China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this way of life, he says.
Even one child asks a lot of time his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of his social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "when your child has only 9 months, you need to write her CV for a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are ready to that experience again, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want too many sacrifices.

The UN group plans to plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the UN - characterised so far by earmarking désorganisées and mutual recriminations -- is back in the spotlight on Friday, because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases in the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the next time.
The text that could provide the foundations of a final political agreement on regulating greenhouse gases, pointed out the remaining barriers, he has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations who lack of time, with more than 100 leaders of the world coming next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special working group, the text does not say how many rich countries would give the poor to cope with climate change, of course and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for the key issues, including how the economies developed and emerging economies new could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the rise in global temperature that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate.
It gives a great flexibility in the process, said John coequyt, àwashington representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has studied a text of negotiations to 180 pages to concentrate on what has described the executive secretary general on climate change to the UN, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines to an agreement in which the industrial nations should reduce collectively their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to cope with floods and droughts or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal squabbling occurred, which have dominated the negotiations for the last week.
Todd Stern, representative of the US negotiating climate has rejected any discussion, forcing the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also lamented that the text is not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outsiders.
Stern has made his comments about an hour after the Chinese deputy foreign affairs, He Yafei has said that the principal negotiator, is a lack of "common sense", or was "highly irresponsible" for having said earlier this week that the US does not help financially China to combat climate change.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects appeared at the time in the third world and between the world of industrial and emerging economies.
The battle now is more relevant to the rescue of individual economies that saving the planet, with China and the United States hair cuts on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries the most influential ignore scientific need to act more boldly.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the big issuers accountable for their actions.
This is really a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, which is also advise on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of those countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated they would continue to put the pressure for a treaty forcing legally, in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that negotiations will get at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States comprising 43 states, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the unity of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states has "put political pressure on the political process is complete, in part by what they are now unified and demand in emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while the delegates were focussing on the fact that they must solve most of the issues pending before the heads of governments come to an agreement.
High level officials such as environment minister, Jairam Ramesh Indian and Chinese deputy took their plane and ran in the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings behind closed doors and in conferences of information, in order to make claims which will be considered during the following week.
The real picture of the rally -- during which 13,000 people come in and out of the palace of Congress every day -- activists Guitare players with nightly performances, mocking the countries that they will reveal that the proposals are made and distributed on paper, rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is more important: almost all the ministers are here and no later than on Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big boys, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president of global politics of Conservation International.
The trucks arrive.

In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine the syndrome on Monday.
To 5h13, on Monday morning, a whistle percera night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first commuter train at high speed of the country will reach 225 km / h, while it filera of Ashford, in Kent to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes in the first commuter train javelin outside London.
It hopes that the new service will allow Britain to include an international network of fast trains and reliable, and will link the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small holes, lost cities, suburbs will become successful, the Times of business travel will be far less long and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce the national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the ten billion needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of dangers to the environment may slow the high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to achieve for the government a feasibility report, will make his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
It will get a detailed map the route of the next step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to West Midlands will be established in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres final journey.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network, go to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
Inside the options put forward in a format in which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will be in two at or near Birmingham, with one arm towards the west of Pennines àmanchester and Scotland and another going toward the northeast, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cut across Scotland.
"It seems to be the best option of performance, said a professional of the railways.
When it is finished, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with a trip to an hour.
The proposals will allow trains to travel to 400km / h, making the UK grid the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line in London, Birmingham.
A terminal for 000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Having given the constraints of space, it is intended as existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry say that only St. Pancras International or Euston offer this option.

The taxpayers pay back the loan of 75 000 GBP for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, a leading member of parliament Tory, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to reimburse the cost of a Orangerie that it has built in his house in his constituency.
The head of the party which has been demoted by David Cameron to have complained that members of parliament had "maintained," has increased its loan of 75 000 GBP to build an extension in Oak to its second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to pay the extra interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at the time and have not been asked by Sir Thomas Legg, making a controlling spending of states. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer and more simple."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a house on two floors in a village of his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby homes were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a hairdresser and a room to eat, but the bureau salary claims that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a véranda at home, describing in its plans as a orangeraie.
The neighbours describe it as a "véranda for fun."
It was not asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase borrowing during a recent investigation made by the committee for privileges and standards of the Commons, on its loans.
The Committee has cleared the last month in charge of breach of rules, after an investigation into its spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal certainty of the loan of 271.406 GBP to his property in London in the home of his constituency that he has bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan was approximately $1.4 GBP per month of interest on loans up to March last year.
In April, its applications have increased more than 1.8 GBP per month.
Interest rates on the loan RBS Mr Duncan has not been changed at this time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the loan of 75 000.
The standard variable interest rates RBS has risen from 7,94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, nothing since then.
The latest publication of the authorities of the Commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask 1.250 GBP in May.
Mr Duncan has lost his post as head of the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist in coverage has allegedly filmed saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the scandal of spending.
"It is now, you have to live" on budget "and you are treated as" the m e ….
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was correct.
And I could ask sacrément more, but I have not done. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former job as a negotiating oil, has started to explain its spending in May, after it emerged that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the Bureau of charges that it "could be considered excessive."
An activist has created a hole in the form of £in the lawn of Mr Duncan, in protest after it was revealed that he had asked 4,000 GBP for three years ago.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements, approved by both the office of expenses and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of a cop-out or development or use the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules allowed, etc.
This could not be clearer and more simple. "

It has never set foot in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor in Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, has said that Roman Polanski should be there to be at the hearing ".

Thirty-two years is enough. "

The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," said Friday his son David on his arrival at the airport in Los Angeles where it should go by his father in hospital for several days.
The new are very positive.
It is very strong, it happens very well, told the press David Hallyday to its exit from the plane that brought in Paris shortly after 13h00 local (9 p.m. GMT.
The son of singer, the air relaxed, ensured that he was going to make "very quickly" to the hospital cedars-sinaï of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernie discale on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for a reason for comfort, to prevent suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors in the hospital cedars-sinaï Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernie discale on 26 November in Paris.
The singer has had to be réopéré night on Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries resulting from this speech.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning at the French High School in Los Angeles where is scolarisée their daughter Jade, to attend a spectacle at school, has seen a photographer of the AFP.
The chief of surgery orthopédique and traumatologique hospital of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves catoné announced that it would go on Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has sharply questioned Dr Stéphane delajoux, the neurochirurgien which has operated the singer on 26 November at the clinic's international Park morass in Paris.
We said it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr Camus.
I have heard about a possible legal action to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus has estimated that Johnny Hallyday party was "far too fast for Los Angeles, with permission from the surgeon Parisian".
I had this doctor in person in line, which has assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, given that I myself had two hernies discales, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, it had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without combat with nothing," after his operation in Paris.
Dr Stéphane delajoux is very experienced in the midst of art.
He had made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death in a clinic to Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reduce a hématome following a brain haemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor to the reputation sulfureuse, repeatedly condemned by the justice in medical liability, and for tax fraud and deception.
I Metzner tree, the lawyer of the order of doctors, has accused of being "a man without scruples" continued "regularly" before the Council of the order, and who is "not appropriate".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David koubbi.
It has indicated that the intervention was "quite well" and that the tests post-opératoires were "normal".
The operation "was not hémorragique and is therefore not have a combat," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health worries are mounting for this summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the Tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr Camus.

The association UDF increase the tone and after the new centre to stop using its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the modem to François Bayrou, responded Friday to the attempted takeover of the president of the new centre, Hervé Morin, the symbol of the ex-parti giscardien, in the setting is not to use it on any carrier, under pain of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou was not worthy to defend his legacy after reaching out to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support its approach, it has received the support of Hervé de Charette (ex-ump past the NC) which claims ownership of the UDF for being the first to the table in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the Bureau of the Association UDF, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not want to lose, is out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and member, the request not to use the letters and transfer the ownership of the brand, for fear of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement of + resume + the acronym UDF, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of 24 members of the bureau, whose François Bayrou and de Sarnez the modem, as well as Senator John Arthuis centrist alliance.
You have also seen fit to follow on your material militant and on the page in your site, the name of this movement, the new centre + + +, the slogan the UDF today +, also see the signatories of the mail.
As you know, you have no right to this symbol, explains the office of the UDF that is the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF to support and (his) website."
It also calls for Hervé de Charette "to pass on the property of (the) marks its legitimate copyright holders".
If you are not the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF warn the signatories.
In their letter they specify that the UDF 'is a political movement in full since 1978, "and argued that Mr Morin and his friends had" made the choice "to leave in 2007" to create a competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP. "
The new centre did so, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (union for French democracy).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material interests and moral 'training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, is pursuing the bureau, "when he established the brand," he was "more unites the UDF for three years', but the UMP.
It is outrageous and sentenced to the abscence submission to the UDF to carry out to his account.
This brutality is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils before mock, on the strategy of the NC: "It seems that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for themselves than to try to get out of anonymity by taking fraudulently a name that was not right '.

Liliane Bettencourt affair: françois-marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided Friday to assess the artist françois-marie Banier to determine if, as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of the weakness of the octogénaire to rob a part of his fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, known for its pictures of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a criminal offence to a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment and 375.000 euros fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the families of France, where mother and daughter have been taking the reins of the empire of the Oréal cosmetic.
But the 15th House criminal has also ordered that a medical expertise to Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be conducted as a college by three doctors.
Heir and main shareholder of the Oréal has always refused to bow to such scrutiny, not in any case under the terms proposed by the public prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors named Friday to submit a report before 10 March 2010 by saying, especially if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in the state of weakness and what periods.
I think it will.
I am going to talk about it, said at the exit of the hearing Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
The lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that there must be protected, he said.
For two years ago, the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt engaged in criminal proceedings against françois-marie Banier, photographer and touche-à-tout artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years to the weakness of his mother for a billion of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or pictures of Masters.
His hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, that it considers a friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers pleading, the lawyers have sometimes turned to the great déballage family on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt indicated three letters sent by its user (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his solicitor, in which it said was wary of her husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: 'Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years ago.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage. "
The prosecutor of Nanterre has estimated that the testimony was not acceptable to act as a judge tutelles declined in recent days to grant her request to open a legal protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has the ability to act, it is not under the protection and has no guardian.
Nobody else has to act in its place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, marie-chrsitine daubigney.
The court has decided that he consulted once the trial will take place on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.

Revolution managerial or end of the intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence has been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees, recalls the position of companies from consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined to as high as it was used to impose the consumer products invented by the technicians from the factory.
By the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution marketing has called the strategies of the conquest of markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products unrelated factors of preferences of customers returning regularly.
A lack of employees can lead to a deadly demoralised.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of something much more general particularly managers.
This demobilisation threatens the development of all the company ’ s intellectual, including R &amp; D, and even more, the intelligence.
Indeed, 'i movement "requires all the stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it needs by employees a commitment that revenue management authoritarian experienced completely.
This is why we call for a revolution managerial skills to set the staff at the centre of the company as the customer.
The value relative to the views of internal investigations.
The investigation of domestic opinion – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in the managerial?
Unfortunately, I suspect not.
Firstly because I saw that, in a new situation, any structure is finally, after beating, primarily … what it has always done.!
- then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of the pouvoir- grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most of the leaders have a simple view of human behaviour.
From the great schools engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They are, for comfort, intellectual, the old theory behavioriste, cranked up recently by the "Neuroscience" American and widely distributed, unbeknownst to them by institutes of studies and the media.
As well, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos survey in the figaro.fr it reinforces the leaders in a position of governance, mechanistic unsuited to the world today.
Identify the causes of action.
Instead, the revolution managerial skills necessary to the functioning of the modern, requires companies to adopt a final vision of human behaviour.
It is to include, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment for the company is possible if it is clear as a means of achieving some of their dreams, their ambitions of their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this view of the motives of employees.
These studies have shown that they think their company based on a predetermined doxa which allows them through their image from the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their projects.
Thanks to the identification and the extent of these factors of mobilisation, business managers can control, and anticipate their 'performance' and put their management of human resources "to the place".
They create a breeding ground to a concerted economic intelligence robust and effective.

Oslo speech: "just war" is due to the right to Obama
The American right welcomed Friday's speech on the eve in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of America.
The Conservatives, who had brocardé awarding the prize to Mr Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speeches, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, égérie the right-hand side of the Republican Party, the newspaper USA Today ', adding itself addressed the subject of war' sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have just been published.
The war is obviously the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists everything out there, she felt.
Mr Obama, who has inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has tried Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan, nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich has estimated that the president had done in Oslo "very good job".
I found the speech was very well, welcomed the former president of the House of Representatives, who has particularly appreciated the mention of "The existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
By some side, I found this quite historic, said Mr Gingrich, asked at the radio programme 'The Takeaway. "
The former elected, regarded by some as a candidate at the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said that he is delighted to have seen "a president left" to remind members of the Nobel committee "that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, a former boxer George W. Bush handed over in the Washington Post columnist, Mr Obama made "a very American."
In addition to present itself as "citizen of the world" as it always does', "he spoke as an American President", pointing out the European "that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and they do little to preserve biodiversity," said Mr Gerson.
Among the few right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, has described the speech "dull, spouted and inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
To the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich has alarmed to see Barack Obama to justify the use of force.
When it is funding the war in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The Press of centre-left remained, however, complimentary to the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, described his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech of Oslo "should serve as a roadmap to guide the international decisions against the wars, poverty and oppression," has inflamed the Daily Californian.
Mr Obama "gave the speech he had", has estimated the New York Times, the judges' the dark and inspiring ".

According to him, the increases will be the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and the respect of employees, said Maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry douine (CFTC) has welcomed a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has raised "a compromise acceptable".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs of 3%, and the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow us to address the issue of a 13th month and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau said that "a drop of 100 million euros in employers' contributions" was the subject of a government amendment to the bill to reform finance for 2009, voted in last Thursday night on Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same."
The signing of TLF means that the agreement is applicable in the first time companies adhérentes this organisation, and in a second time, to the entire profession, in case of extended by the Minister of Labour.
It will "soon", has assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised for the sector to offset some of the carbon tax."
The secretary of state to transport was forced to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion to a shared, but not to antagonise the chewing Turkey in the next party, has complained about the unostra.
For the otre the agreement is likely to deepen the grave of a large number of medium-sized businesses in the next 12 months ".

A: RER disruption this weekend, trade unions unhappy with proposals for the RATP
The disruption on the RER has the biggest line of public transport of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday in the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP has left on their hunger as to their demand for premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend shopping before Christmas, there will be trains between 10.00 a.m.and 8 p.m., at a train on two on the central section (between defence and nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre prefecture, which will require passengers to change.
The Galleries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy that "the RATP making efforts to serve the stores'.
The rer is crossing of the West is the city of Paris.
The stretch RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in boissy-saint-léger and Marne-la-Vallée.
On Friday, about a train on two circulated at peak times, and almost no rowed in empty hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there was no melee on the dock, the franciliens is being organised.
And in the morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, particularly because of lack of collégiens and pupils.
To boissy-saint-léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack nbakina, an engineer for 29 years ago, explained to be lifted "half an hour earlier, so be sure to arrive on time."
The station Saint-Lazare has not been saturated, said the SNCF, which had provided a framework of officials and security forces.
The rer is operated by the train from or to cergy-le-haut arrived or jaunt to the station Saint-Lazare to join the tube.
New general meetings of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, found "disappointing" by the trade unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER is proposing to negotiate a special protocol for the RER has on all aspects, work, holding career etc.
This is not want drivers, who demand a premium because, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP is even its proposals for a premium, incidentally, was incensed the CGT, stressing that the leadership "was not kaput to solve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader examination of the working conditions," said the RATP.
What was said to the unions that the company "is moquait users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris.
This is when the leadership, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, suggested "in order to appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B on Tuesday, after a warning by UNSA and independent.
The trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros which EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, independent) and complain of the deterioration of working conditions on that line the 1 million daily passengers.
The drivers of the RER, all in the second part of careers, have 2.200 to 2.700 euros and 600 to 650 euros in premiums, the Times odds, Sundays and holidays.

The Turkish courts dissolved the pro-Kurdish party decision with serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court said Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east and Istanbul.
This decision is likely to vastly complicate the task of the government, which has just reach out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "hotbed of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its unity indivisible", told the press the president of the court Hasim kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimous in the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven was required to make the dissolution, said Mr kiliç, adding that 37 senior party, its president, Ahmet türk and the Aysel Tugluk are banned from politics for five years ago.
The judge has also announced the closure of parliamentary immunity had enjoyed Mr and Mrs Tugluk türk and confiscated by the Treasury assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would be moving out of parliament rather than to sit as members of parliament without a label.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman yalçinkaya, which accuses the DTP to obey 'directives "of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the showcase legal policy of PKK rebels.
The party holds that it did "not organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and the government to negotiate with him.
The court's verdict comes as the government has just reach out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to stymie the support of Kurdish PKK and end the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a collapse could lead to an escalation of tensions in the south-east anatolien, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
When the news of Justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the big city in the south-east populated by a majority of Kurds.
The police fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched Molotov cocktails or stones, with slings.
One hundred people marched in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr türk said that the court ruling was "deepening despair."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish ndlr) by banning a party, he said at the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, has also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, said the minister of energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a torpillage total of the Democratic opening launched by the government, has commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers, three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most lethal in recent months.

The first snows can
What would Wolfgang brauburger is a winter of rigorous.
But the head of service for too long and sablage roads (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy people.
This is simply for the agents can test the vehicle and learn to control them.
And after the métérologues, that could be for this week ending.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles is ready to tackle the snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan.
Mr brauburger explains that when it starts to Neiger on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero, large vehicles to sablage travel 20 routes main (nicknamed routes).
This includes the streets on a large movement, the main arteries, as the Neue difficulties and the Hanauer landstraße.
Also included access to the firefighters, the routes of transport, the pedestrian areas and the streets in as the atzelbergstraße.
The agents of the FES starting their service for three hours of morning.
If necessary, no 1040 miles of roads must be salt with a dark road that adheres to 3 p.m. time limit.
This is why the service of Fes begins to 3H in the morning "so that the roads to be released when the trafficking of daily migrations."
Where it is becoming more difficult, it is when the snow to fall à7h30 in the morning.
This is causing problems, says the head of service for too long and sablage roads "because no driver is prepared to allow vehicles to salage."
Then, if it does nothing more, we are the roads of access and roads network - as the rat-beil-straße.
Secondary roads and streets latérales come last.
Mr brauburger knows that it is always a few complaints.
At 5 a.m., the team of Fes pedestrian is in motion for release in priority areas deemed dangerous and the passages.
On the bicycle paths, the services of Fes can rarely be dealt with.
Mr brauburger specifies that there is in Frankfurt, a service spécialqui deals to monitor the state bridges between 22heures and 4.30.
As the ice to form very quickly on this land, the vehicles of salage act as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police appeals to the special service encas needed.

The birthplace of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae looked the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this was bipède approximately 2 metres for 1,50m high, its members post were powerful, his skull lying was filled teeth acérées and recourbées, his short arms are terminaient through cracks in sickle and he had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, she would not have had nothing special.
But, as reports sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the magazine Science on Thursday, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these features morphologiques.
This animal was 215 million years in New Mexico who faisaità then part of land émergées of supercontinent, the pangée and was to Ecuador.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of Tawa sheds new light the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it could comment on the relationship, the distribution and characteristics.
In 2006, sertling Nesbitt has undertaken searches in the company other paléontologues, on the site of gohst Crawford ranch in northern New Mexico
Randall irmis Museum of Natural History of Utah and member of the team searches have been told that they were sometimes find a dozen skeletal remains given in a day which is entirely unique for a layer sédimentaire dated Trias.
Scientists are very soon realised that a portion of the skeletal remains given belonged to a new species.
The excavation has revealed the remains of five specimens.
A discovery which confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers have called on behalf of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the Sun God.
For sterling Nesbitt, it is a quite exceptional discovery: the fossils of dinosaurs from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of bone incomplete.
All the experts in paléontologie do not share this enthusiasm.
For example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but that it allows us to confirm some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, the dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years.
Most of the fossils older, however, are fragmented and incomplete which makes it very difficult the classification of all first dinosaurs.
The experts are wondering about what time the sauriens are divided into three groups of evolution: the théropodes (carnivores) who understand the tyrannosaure and vélociraptor emerged later and take the birds, the sauropodes, quadrupedal animals in the long neck, and those who are related and the herbivores ornithischiens which are part of the species such as the Triceratops and stégosaure.
According to studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first théropodes.
This case presents an interesting features both primitive and developed, said S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found evidence which suggests that the Tawa hallae possèdait small air bags in his bones in the skull, as the birds that are the descendants of théropodes.
These small pockets of air facilitate the breath of birds from the mammals.
It seems that among the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were partially met by air.
According to irmis Randall, the Tawa is one of the oldest théropodes with small air bags in his bones.
As the lines related to the immense sauropodes had also air bags and a backbone, you may think that their single common ancestor had already that innovation beneficial.

# lang=en docid=334 origlang=fr system=moses corpus=potet type=MT
Three successive waves of migration to the North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs had lived in South America, researchers have concluded that the sauriens had occurred there.
So the three main lines of evolution are divided and have spread from South America to the rest of the world that is all the land émergées who formed the supercontinent pangée.
It seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paléontologues has also discovered the remains of two other théropodes which are not particularly brethren.
The three species can take a single common ancestor would have migrated, say researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of the magazine science studies said that there would have had at least three waves of migration to the North America.
Of course there is a few inconsistencies.
Martin Sander, paléontologue in Bonn said that there is an even older, the silesaure, who lived in Poland and who belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him that could give a distorted view because there is in South America a large number of fossils of dinosaurs that have been preserved so that there is virtually no on other continents.
However, how the dinosaurs, they managed to become the dominant tétrapodes secondary to the era when ilsprovenaient collateral a relatively rare in the branch of the reptiles, is still a mystery.
At the time of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of present-day crocodiles and with many other sauriens.
Towards the end of Trias dinosaurs are spread across the globe promoting the development of many new species, while others were related, have disappeared between Trias and Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There may have a mass extinction of dinosaurs survived randomly, while other reptiles have disappeared.
Then, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they could eliminate the competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a météorite favorisal' development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias, and since this time essentially in the shadows: it was mammals.

The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories of the world.

Last week, President of the university Werner müller-estler did evacuate buildings occupied by students and teachers in grèveaprès that walls and works of art have been daubed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories to believe the damage did not justify "a speech by someone from the police raid against students and teachers who had held their own way".
The evacuation is an "unacceptable breach" of the freedom to research and education.
The focus exclusively on the acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and declare the protest" and is trying to forget the mobilisation.
The steering committee of the university is removed the debates that would be but necessary.
Lecturers are demanding that the criminal prosecution should be suspended immediately.
The majority of occupants did not take part in damage.
Legitimate protests

The protests are only the expression of a growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional secretary of young people from the trade union Verdi.
The minister of science of the land of Eva Hesse kühne-hörmann (CDU), she has sided with the action by the president of the university and the police.
We thank the president of the university.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she said the regional parliament Wiesbaden last Thursday at the television programme aktuelle stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, gave the CDU member of the regional parliament Peter beuth.
The groups of the opposition party, the Greens and the left (left) did not share this view.

The project S21 a check for Stuttgart.
We cannot put enough the enormity of Stuttgart, 21.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe."
If you want. S21, that is far more than repositories of a railway station, more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, chaos in a despairing of yards for a decade.
Stuttgart, 21, was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations front line, with approaches that are terminaient in Full City, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique of transport in the 19th century that were to Sabot brake rail traffic modern because it was once much time to get the engines of the back to before.
Arrival, stopping short, departure – this is what to do it.
This is why the stations front line must stop: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, too: a station of passing trains, which is half-way around on the main rail trans-European between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognised that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, stations, the front line is more serious problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and voiture-pilote at both ends.
It is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
The policies of regional and municipal prevailed.
The company of the railways is in part because it is the taxpayer who paid the price of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public.
The point of view urban this project is relatively well.
You get an urban area who – according to graphics planners generated by computer – will be very verdoyant.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic from people that were - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time it did not exist, the competition cheap flights.
The policy of the modern traffic should first focus on strengthening the transport of goods since the railways is much more environmentally friendly by lorry on the road.
But the new route, with its leanings, is not suited to freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the souabe.
It is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is safe, in the next decade the money involved in other nodes and congestion in the network.
The list of the transport ministry says at least 60 large projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987, this line is built in slow motion.
It would really need to support here to the fungus.
But the project S21 made a Sabot braking.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck freight traffic International, and this in the heart of Europe.

The government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the national government has raised the possibility to appeal the judgment of the administrative court in Hesse with the ban on air flights at night.
The Minister of Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) has announced that the coalition CDU and FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the administrative court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel was justified in a written document that the land should adapt regulations regarding the ban on night flights in the case or the construction of the runway aterrissage north-west of the Frankfurt airport would be fulfilled.
The approval of attérir for 17 aircraft between 23h and 5.00 p.m. in the morning, as envisaged in the national government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against the night air pollution.
The coalition should be decided on 4 January if it wants to make an appeals process against the ruling.
The opposition criticism this time and trying to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce the appeal of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of group SPD Torsten schäfer-gümbel invites the CDU and FDP back to their promise before the elections and who was banned night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total to a word.
It is sacrément difficult to be allowed to keep its word, said the leader of the greens Tariq al-Wazir alluding to the slogan éléctoral FDP "we keep our promises".
The minister Dieter Posch refute accusations of schäfer-gümbel which claims that the national government is trying to allow the night flights using "avocasserie and roublardises."
It takes time to carry out a legal review.
The coalition does not make decisions on the basis of a "rapid" first impression.
The decision is legally accountable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of his section on the night ban is completely érronée.

US banks repay the aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, have taken away from them their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had repaid in full at the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion), equivalent to aid under the rescue plan relief.
The process of American television CNBC said in a report that Citigroup also envisaged to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions are trying to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of, such as limiting bonuses awarded to the leader and the regulation of higher charges.
The Bank of americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities from investors who told him 19 billion dollars of fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the coffers of the Bank that have been met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday evening last year, Kenneth Lewis, the director general of the Bank of America held to thank us taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution was suspected of its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering money on the financial markets to free themselves from the state.
The American bank could launch on Thursday a capital increase to $20 billion, reported quoting the process CNBC banking circles.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the money they received.

Election accelerated
Ultimately, it has nevertheless past faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the post of chief redacteur Nikolaus Brender by the board of the German ZDF process, the successor is appointed.
The Commission wanted to vote last night for the nomination.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The process has not wanted to confirm, officially, the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the desire not to further damage to the intendant ZDF Markus schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the board.
Frey, who is the candidate of schächter, needs the votes of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, schächter had proposed to the board to extend to five years, the contract of Nikolaus Brender but it was rejected.
Only 7 of the council members had signed for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against the impeachment by vote of Brender represented a failure of that needed to schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the board had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not to renew Brender to his post.
It is Roland Koch, the premier of Hesse, who had organised a league against the editor.
He had rejected the contract on the esteemed redacteur chief will be extended, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the emissions of information the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 law experts who had stepped into the debate and felt that the way Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will have achieved nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He has studied the sciences-politiques, education etles romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the südwestfunk (body Radio of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily national significance).
In 1983 it is editor in the ZDF first on the news magazine "heute-journal '(paper today).
Then her journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy rédacteur-en-chef at the time; and corresponding to Washington in 1991 and 1992, and until 1998 he was head and host of "morgenmagazins' (emission of information bimensuelle presented the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the ZDF and then head of Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender when it had just been elected journalist of the year in the short-run Magazin medium, the Greens have announced they laid down a complaint constitutional
The enemy of Koch on board, the prime minister of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should turn the intergovernmental treaty the ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant may not be blocked by a majority politically biased.
However, Beck has no plans to ask the withdrawal of politicians members of committees overseeing the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender was ably manœuvré with the board in criticising the Commission strongly in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to the evidence of journalistic independence, schächter was able to propose for the post of rédacteur-en-chef without losing face, the board was elected without the soupconne put a partisan politics.
In the mathematical representations of parties, Frey is classified as liberal, left-wing.
High up in the academic studies
Partial success for students: After a year to strike the ministers of education, educational and cultural affairs land decide to be more accommodating: during a meeting between ministers and representatives from the conference of vice-chancellors, an agreement has been developed that working conditions of students bachelor and masters degree should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are, in particular set of accordpour lighten the burden of exam: a single study should help to close the module to study.
The burden of work will be reconsidée to ensure "a realistic and acceptable."
The government policies and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The states have also pledged to hold joint structural requirements more flexible for the networks of bachelor and masters.
Regionally, should not be sufficiently different from land to another.
Less than examinations
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the education minister land and the chancellors universities have repeatedly in the mouth the expression on the way: "étudiabilité."
But for the first time, it seems to take a practical significance.
The Accreditation Council has decided to slash the number of some tests: "Each module should normally be reached by a single examination," we read in a document of thirty pages on the future conditions of entry to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, president of the Accreditation Council says that by far the burden of tests should be able to stop the disruption, hurting considerably in the étudiabilité.
"étudiabilité 'should also be in future, the benchmark of the organization of studies.
The modules as the substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot prevent this feeling of stifling that it feels sometimes in the choice of course.
Hamburg / Berlin - the latest knowledge in a raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the leeway to allow and encourage the personal initiative".
The new regulation will include access to new rounds, academic, but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles must be "réaccrédités" every 5 years, which means, however, that only by 2015 that all the rounds have been examined.
There are 10 accrediting agencies responsible for the entire federal territory that depend on Accreditation Council created by the land.
In October, the ministers of education had exerted some pressure on the land so that they are weighing on the agencies so that the programmes are not too busy and the regime exams, not too strict.
In some states, universities and colleges and have already heard from their regional prosecutors to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate so far is the only land to have agreed to give more money to the development of Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise programmes tutorielset strengthen the offices of teaching guidelines and the offices of the service of international relations.
The states and universities provide a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wants to make Parliament an amendment to the law on the institutions of higher education.
Following this, there will be no more than one exam to complete his studies.
The Organization of studies will be more flexible, more needs to be able to guarantee the recognition of the records of notes other institutions of higher education and access to the Masters degree should be simplified.
By the end of next year, "étudiabilité" of all academic cycles will be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and opposition once again have debated the question of study conditions in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but criticisms have been heard.
The federal president of the Union students Socialists has indicated that it would like the Organisation for educational policy does not happen again in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and the vice-chancellors of universities.
In later after the strike educational, students as people should be able to speak a little.

For the Union of education and science (gew) the decisions taken in Bonn does not go far enough. It is demanding the right and the possibility for each graduate bachelor to put on a cycle of Masters.
Andreas Keller steering committee member of the gew request that the states provide students bachelor today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies at the Masters and the conditions of studies as good as possible.
The states need to hire more responsible.
However, the ministers of education have not raised the possibility to ease access to the Masters.

More than a note at the bottom of page on Herta Müller
It is with the words' arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control... "that begins a work of the poet Werner söllner, in which he thématise in slabs of phrases troubling, the experience of a dissident arrived in Germany who won the freedom but lost in its territory.
Werner söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collectors in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt.
Söllner received several literary prize, in 1993 he was very popular the professorship of poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002, it is director of the forum of literature in Hesse with the house of artist of mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He has done a lot of him in literary circles not last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files Securitate."
Obviously disturbed and embarrassed, söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William totok, Franz hodjak, and Mr frauendorfer he had worked as an informant for the police policy Securitate.
Söllner received in 1989, the price of the German language in conjunction with some of the participants.
The tests for recruitment had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, "concludes söllner so someone who has not sufficiently resisted auxessais intimidation of the Securitate."
The poet Werner söllner is the informant Walter (Im Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel prize for Herta Müller and his battles literary star with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken, and especially the community of writers Germans from Romania, for a case which clearly shows the abyss and the heinous act of a political system, based on police surveillance and intelligence.
Werner söllner is, as we can say after the current knowledge, not just guilty but also a victim.
In his own dossier Securitate, Im Walter has played a role, the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of söllner and it refers to the positive influence of Im Walter, who had intervened in his favour.
"It had been drawn from all the difficult situations at the time," according to Markel.
Markel felt the need moralde make this comment.
The form in which söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence Service is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit, having read the 914 pages of his own case.
We can assume that the victims have been speculation and will have guessed what real names, sometimes hiding last names of loans Sorin, voicu and Walter.
In contrast to Germany where time between the consultation of the Stasi process is a reliable, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate is still very confused.
A systematic investigation has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed down in the past.
This is that in 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was created to work the assimilation of archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the return of cases has dragged on since.
Is there since 2005, a law that defines the management of the archives.
As the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very much, is confirmed by the interview a former head of the Securitate to temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, by way of trés dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately had been questioned only once.
The shame of power to speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, unavoidable questions are involved in the case söllner as it happens so often in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now?, which has been robbed? the reaction of the listeners, according to söllner, gives us hope that the next chapter will be defined more by a desire to know that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received yesterday, the Nobel Prize, is more than a note at the bottom of page.

Storms in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was there, best from any right to a celebration of Christmas nice, on which the manufacturer of sporting goods had displayed its goods when the new coach VfB Christian Gross Monta at midnight the quarter in a Mercedes C Class, he had just called, a plastic bag, Orange, the supplier.
The man, whose skull chauve drew the attention, allowed himself to lead in the city that he was still.
Otherwise our quinquagénaire could take the wheel – it was not drunk alcohol and it was not intoxicated happiness.
He had spent an evening pleasant but tomorrow we needed to resume work.
Because it is now that it would start.
The words of Switzerland that we had to take three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the final eight of," it is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni Romania ’ but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success. It will be a brutal struggle not to fall back. "
"The great work," We expected Sunday.
There, it is repeated in Mainz, the results of the Champions League.
And it will overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals a hasty to Marica (5.), träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The eighth of final of the Champions League (match go 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 February / return match 9. / 10. + 16. / 17. March) will be drawn to the 18. December to Nyon.
The joy of taking office fulminante the successor to Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only for those who brought a chance, who had sent to Stuttgart destabilised, a highly motivated and fun to play.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should concentrate on their strengths, I have advised to be more courageous, expliqua the plumber 'souls' – Gross, the recipe for success that was so bienmais which was more effects with the soigneur Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - in favour of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of pause to injury, avança among the best player, thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" seen by a proverbial ‘ Wind of Change "and working methods of the new leader:" It is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet over the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart are in need of tenacity.
Just as Gross, the players and the manager tightlipped about overstate the victory against a defense completely out of date and weakened the guests Romanians.
They had also won in Glasgow before I had four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, signala that they had actually reached the objectives of the season but they were others who were still far away.
We have not yet past the difficult hurdle.
That Heldt the day of his 40th birthday was not the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, is at the weekend's events as a television interview of the Guardian of Jens Lehmann did pick up just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others are not Jens, contrecarrait Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the direction of weakness in style and said she had decided a change of coach under pressure from fans pubertaires.
Lehmann was judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele his day of free after the game he was removed.
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure self-interest" slid Heldt and announced the consequences for the Guardian of purpose.
They were more to become friends for life in these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they were in agreement for the rest, is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong sports representation and combative would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been "largely a success" in the rétorquèrent Heldt and Lehmann United – and even the rights to the plastic bag acquiesça.

The case Kunduz
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Defence Minister Guttenberg lie in the case of the case Kunduz.
The SPD and the left (left) to ask the Chancellor of the explanations.
Hamburg and Berlin, after considering the latest information on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition has accused the minister of defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The minister has intentionally, "a fiction" on the deadly attack two camions-citernes in September, said the leader of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday over the release of information to the process' ard Tagesschau "(The Journal of 20h).
This means that he lied.
The order of killing has been given to disregard the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (Isaf).
It is, in essence, the report available to NATO and has been read by Mr Guttenberg Trittin, has said.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the aim of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but sought to eliminate two major Taliban leadership.
According to the inquiry report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured during the attack American airline which was launched at the request of Colonel German Goerg Klein, commander of military Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have called on Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to vote as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin, and his colleague from the Green Party Renate künast believe that Mrs Merkel must make clear if the strategy of killing targeted is part of the Afghan policy, the government fédéralet if the chancellery, army and intelligence services have approved the new strategy.

The worlds of dream
Some see, while awake, images and voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only among patients with mental health or under the effect of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality are mixed.
While these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying down in our bedrooms overshadowed, we can operate without barriers to dreams and the wildest fantasies.
However, awake, the experience of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has quickly reputation in the Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices are not that among patients with mental or under the effects of drugs.
It is our imagination that is in question: is the same activity neuronale which allows us to design houses, painting tables or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and the reality to vanish.
A state of Awakening aware, taking the shape of a dream, can stand in the most diverse, at best it is called visions, the worst of madness.
But even if the cause and effect distinguish themselves, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs in the prophet of the new age Carlos Castaneda member drawings of chamanes, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to the process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of substances neurotransmettrices brain - first the dopamine, the noradrenalin, serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
The hallucinations and délirantes complex thoughts are very often during a psychosis, schizophrenic.
The pull on earth has more power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked on the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, found in 1861, "a great similarity between the madness and the dream" for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis, with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and illusions sensory who made up."
We are in the autumn of 2001 when Henning t turned into a figure of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the criardes colours.
The attraction on earth has more power over him, there is to flood the ceiling.
It is a blow.
Behind him ailées creatures on earth, grimaçantes, the bloody, showing its teeth.
They are, give it little feet with heavy boots, the flamboyantes cast against the walls, it feels the pain throughout the body.
The voice over grand, evil, howl, leaving the walls and radio.
It can no longer the bear these voices who revile and humiliating.
Henning T. snatched two cables to its chain stéréo, in fact a circle and attaches to a crochet set the ceiling.
It gets on a baffle and goes on the circle around the neck.
It is clear.
The circle stands out.
This reflects a lesson, mouthing the voice in a chorus to extract the tympan. "is in a clinic and fais-toi cure!"
Today Henning T. 40 years he lived six psychoses acute, the last 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he married for three years ago.
During the fear I have experienced the fears terrible and despondency deep.
Illusions are a harsh reality.
Around one percent of the population suffers from at least once in his life of schizophrenia in clinics and hospitals that is the most common illness after the Depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the world and the outside world, they are in a state of wildly excitement, they may suffer from hallucinations, of megalomania, madness relationnelle or persecution.
It is very easy to hear voices – people who order, which elicited comments or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person can no longer distinguish between the large and small, the brain can no longer to filter the signals troublemakers, the conscious is deluged with sensations.
As the dream, the hype opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and fantasies, the deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality into the hype is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of department of psychiatry of Chu in Heidelberg (Allgemeine psychiatry Im universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation, meaning that focuses on him.
Meanwhile, he is in a passive role, it is a dream, overcome by the events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why the schizophrenic often feel threatened, inspected and manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusion is a harsh reality, wake up is excluded.
To experience once in his life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the structure sensory and space of the reality that is seen during the hype, is fundamentally retained".
The thoughts and hallucinations délirantes are based on reality and alienation of lived in a real framework.
Why our brains do this kind of ’, is always a puzzle for scientists.
Exceptional situations can get everyone to lose at the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the only factors.
The researchers suspect that those involved to tiny brain damage.
We assume that the neuronale maturation of the brain is distraught at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what is still unexplained, was how the anomaly of the neuronal happens and also the fact that it is not for many years.
The environmental factors also play a role – the stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, however, if there is predisposition.
Of even the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger of psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains chauffe.
This is crazy, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotiques suffer from hallucinations and take their medicines costly to unravel when others are buying drugs very expensive for obtaining them.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a point of view.
Kasten together for ten years of reports of hallucinations and phenomena of images of make-believe: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "the imaginary world in our heads".
The hallucinations do well among the concomitant phenomena is typical of psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
There are some psychological problems as borderline or depression but also the headache, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or the trauma crânien.
It is surprising to see that under certain conditions even the brains of people healthy is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consists of fragments of memories that are normally inhibés.
They are taking shape when the brain areas who treat the sensory perceptions are HyperActives or not enough refrénées; when our brains chauffe but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But the lack of stimulus, stress, much misery of love or other mental states exceptional.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledges having at least once in his life experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives a small town of Pomerania earlier and it goes to school.
A girl to do everything normal to tell the truth.
If there was not the images and voices.
In the playground, it is that a young boy, thin, with long hair châtain, send him to speak.
When it meets his comrades watch, surprised – nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this girl timid is a rêveuse lunatic but Sarah K do not dream, it is certain.
It is led, hear and see this boy just as it sees and hears the daughter who is sitting next to it on the bench.
It can even see its presence temporarily.
It is a feeling good, it found that young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, asks it sometimes.
But she knows that this young and the other models are not real and that they will disappear again.
The night the outbreaks are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When it is in class, sometimes it can follow the course because the professor is just trying to present a new pupil in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is obviously going to explain the equations in the picture.
The night the outbreaks are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his house, it expects the sleep, which happens all too rarely and far too late, it often cannot distinguish if it is being stirred or dream already, if the images that it sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with sanguinolentes cuts on the arms and legs before his eyes open or closed.
Let me calm, asking it to these creatures.
It does not speak to his parents or friends, they would for a crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. now has 20 years ago.
It has had his box last year and she lives with his friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came in contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives, the likelihood is that it has hallucinations after some time.
I suppose that the brain is not quite busy, means that there are like.
Sarah K., daughter, was afraid of other children when it was small and was often alone.
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that the man she called Daddy, since she was in age, was not his real father.
This is the same brain areas that are active in the visual hallucinations and noise, and the impressions and there are real, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah k to make the difference between the illusion and reality. "every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are the images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten night, the dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are no different fundamentally of psychoses acute.
Unlike the schizophrenic, the person mentally healthy is able to recognise that the fantasies are not the pictures are real.
This is why Kasten advises her patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for ailments, according to Michael schmidt-degenhard, professor at Heidelberg clinic and a doctor's chief of psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
The scare is a serious illness, painful but which also contains something positive, creator – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a particular form of the amendment to the conscience being stirred by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are semi-rêves very complex, which are seen as real in the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awakening.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware, have a paralysis.
According to schmidt-degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and the world, due to a total failure and move it replaces the real situation which undermines his life by its own fantasy world that is separated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world has all but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is a form of resources and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, the ability of organisation which is given to men, not to sink in the ruins of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories.
The zurichois Peter Classen Cornelius, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "change of heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
It has 49 years, when her aware of a journey of several days after the operation of a corneas with a transplant, meanwhile, his body is doomed to stand still in being resuscitated.
Claussen plunges into a world that it has created, visit the places foreign trip in time. It is as old man bed in a sanatorium rail, a robot in his mind on his health care.
He lives in the middle ages of the noble manufacturing drugs based on blood.
It is kidnapped by a Greek to Moto who goes in his country, it surfe with his hospital bed in the névé the Alps and meeting a Korean Mafia.
It absorbs completely in this world, everything is real, even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic travel differ fundamentally from any dream.
The dream is a quite different, he writes in describing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, the memories from the mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
You could say that they are much more and more intensive than the experience.
The intensity of this experience is breaking out the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist schmidt-degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes delusions, hallucinations, psychoses and experiences psychédéliques show our representations of reality outside are fragile, even in Eve.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call the reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.

Burda
For 27 years, children will take the continuation of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of editions Burda is an interim solution: more long-term, Hubert Burda hope that his two children are taking a group of press, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% with a family business.
Hamburg, has long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will become the lot for 27 years and are committed to integrate the company, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will come later.
It will also see if they are capable of.
We cannot impose their children to 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to look at it.
This démolirait children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that it is pulling out of the post président-directeur-général in January and that his successor was paul-bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years, is a member of the board since 1999.
It was primarily responsible for the technology.
Later he held the Treasury is to say he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer it took the head of marketing, foreigner, the impression and finance.
And for the first time this is not a family member who is head of Burda versions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, which would have now 42 years, died a few years.
The nommination of Kallen also serves to make the connection of the 10 or 15 years. "
Burda specifies that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who have been causing a compulsive desire for capital, which have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could grow ever higher.
It was never my strategy.
I have never been rêvede universal power, said Burda.
I am absolutely not in the role of précepteur as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of the leagues international as the time, these companies have taken too much importance.

Mazda3 i-stop a lasting sporting spirit.
Saloon intends to prove that the spirit of sport is not angry with respect to the environment.
À this effect, it has to take on the Mazda3 the system to stop and start the engine, called i-stop, a device which, at least for the moment, is available only on the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the note that it has achieved in its entirety.
The details, finishing the vehicle, the board, the behaviour, the mechanics, the system i-stop...
All these aspects are remarkable in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the post of conduct, it appears that fronts the seats have a workplace ergonomics and setting excellent.
The touch the steering wheel is also very pleasant.
By continuing with the whole formed by the Board of Control and say, we see how saloon has continued in the trend of Japan to create a futuristic design of interior, with many buttons and orders, and the vivid colors, red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 that the Civic, all of two Japanese, contrast with the brevity of German products, particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, everyone wants to overtake.
By continuing with the systems, the Japanese car packed with a board more than enough to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to this great boot on regular.
The system of automatic and start the engine, at least for the moment, is available only on the gasoline engine of two litres and 150 horses and change manual of six speeds.
This engine is a true happiness. It is illustrated by his finesse, his low noise, its benefits and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the Mazda3 most requested the diesel models, those who are not a large number of miles per year should not rule out this i-stop with motor gasoline, both for his great comfort to speed its consumption.
On the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the sport, which has the highest number of elements of series.
Among the series, the assistant to change of direction (RVM) who kills the spot, the controls of traction and stability, the regulator, the mirror inside photosensible, on-board computer on a screen of large size, the parking sensors, the air conditioning independent, the capteur of rain and light, the Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio, and the wheels of alignment of 17 inches, are particularly remarkable.
Moreover, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the pack schedules, which, for €1,500 more, includes, among other elements of adaptive headlights bi-xénon and an audio system with charger Bose record.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best cars compactes its category.
It is especially by the quality of materials used by his behaviour and by his level of high.
Moreover, those who do not travel many miles per year will be able to choose the version i-stop involved only at the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
The only drawback of the model is its high price, which lies between 21 770 euros for finishing luxury and 23 270 euros for the model tested, the sport.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will give us every day a large dose of satisfaction.

The promise of fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a mechanism which allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
He tabled its five minutes of glory to the États-unis when TIME magazine the act as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see him in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, peek offers a monthly subscription price and a very low - less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data to the iPhone.
Given his success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, another with a free service data to life, for six times more expensive than peek.
Fonpeek presented yesterday at the event the Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited his grand-frère American, but there is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what is the fact of the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection to FON) to check his e-mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and as long as it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and options, but for me, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated reminders to the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable across Europe have had a barely perceptible.
À outside his home country, people hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
Only a small device as the fonpeek (it is always curious that it is FON when he has no WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various proposals to increase their network of data.
Kindle is another good example, he understands the download books and other research on the Internet.
Without a subscription and soup.
It is a piece logged on and we are paying at its purchase and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see a day for the fonpeek: an option to purchase with access to life as the Peek is already the États-unis.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that the phrase is more fair to the consumer.
This would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.

The favourite colour of Michelle
The yellow is probably the favourite colour of the first lady of États-unis.
If it went to the inauguration of Barack Obama in the États-unis with a penitent and a mantle of this colour, it has chosen the same to accompany it in the second time, without doubt, the more important to his life: the award in Oslo, the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was a model very similar to those two occasions: in addition to their colour ressemblante, drawing a yellow to green with reflections bright, both times, consisted of three parts: the penitent, jacket and the coat, in the same tissues, and was ornée of great broderie or a string.
So a first glance, it seems that the first lady of États-unis follows the aftermath of the Princess of Asturias and chose to get the same held.
But the fabric in which are carved up the two sets of makes them very different.
If the assumption of office, it was a delicate manoeuvring chunky, however, it was printed in Oslo a velvet.
Accessories are also different: green shoes to Achilles means for the first opportunity, and a similar pattern, but, this time.
The salon she too has changed: The hair is now met while she was abandoned last time.

75% of working mothers have had problems because of their fertility professionals
Discrimination at work has risen in recent years, especially for women, young people who want to be mothers.
It is that the study "fertility and career women in Spain," carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto the Mujer.
The inquiry, carried out on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years, leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers are limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, if the woman is working or not, and the type of employment occupied.
Those who did not work outside the home, work part-time work or have a more stable, to come earlier in the couple, have their first pregnancy sooner and more children.
However, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, have rejected the entry in the couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
The women between 35 and 49 years ago with a work sets have their first child, on average 3.7 years after being installed as couples. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "these data show that women who have a stable job was needed more time in their lives to get, which has led to repel the union and the arrival of children.
The type of job exerted influence largely motherhood, but not the beginning of life together, "explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the investigation, the level of training is high, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference remains as among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group having between 35 and 49 years, those with basic and higher than have been mothers respectively for the first time to 25,1 and 32,1 years on average.
"Another disctinction is also among women, according to their level of studies.
While those who have done studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtain a stable job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Mrs Delgado.

A cowardly attack
Last week, my mother, who has about 70 years ago, last days strolling round in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent as part of it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the APS and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two shots of feet which left the dog seriously injured.
Our outrage is huge because we do not see that there are fun to attack free of charge a small animal defenceless, moreover, was in leaves.
It is in addition to the outrage of a lady who quietly last days strolling round and, when she injuria these individuals, came to fear for their physical, as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, a burden and, ultimately, any person lower than him.
The episode came at 5 p.m. on Tuesday as another in a district usually quiet.
The dog has gémi all day.
Of course we have filed complaints in the office of the neighborhood, even if we doubt that it is used to much, and not to touch the sensitivities, we want to just say that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Outrage led to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find amusing to mistreat animals without charge, a defence which gives us love, friendship and keeps US airline.
We do not know where is the good education and the respect of animals and people.

Michelin and fesvial, sets for wearing the headphones
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish foundation for road safety (fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among motorcyclists youngsters, said today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the headphones, since it is the only element of protection to prevent injury to the head, or even death, in an accident in two wheels.
Michelin has indicated that this campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, "goes beyond the design and manufacture products more safe" and said that it contributed to this goal by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign of encouragement from the port of the helmet on two wheels, under the slogan "to be but not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest audience.
Finally, Michelin has pointed out that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for the two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After nearly two years ago, the market for light commercial vehicles are beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain is an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more important, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the trade union business sectors of the manufacturers Anfac and ganvam, the dealers.
However, it should be set against the good news since the reference to the comparison, the November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the event last month, registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from cars, a, fourgonnettes, fourgons light and light trucks) Windows 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect the more their requests have not provided. Indeed, although they are also bought by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized businesses, which pay in almost 100% of cases, thanks to an external funding.
And, more restrictions involved by limiting the bank loans, other factors such as the increase in unemployment and the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this situation and unlike cars, aid to the purchase of the 2000e have little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and small businesses who want to acquire a commercial vehicle slightly less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that no more than 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in ganvam, recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The Association of dealers provides for a year 2010 similar to that which is, for which she found a drop in sales of passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.

The emergency braking is now obligatory
As has occurred with the system anti-lock brakes abs and it will take place with the ESP stability control systems for aid to the emergency brake will be a compulsory part on European cars.
They are already mandatory in cars and light commercial vehicles, while newly registered for the rest of vehicles, a period of weakness has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by his mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected in the system through the kick to set by the driver.
But it does not maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of aid, in Revancha, requires the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were fitted with this type of elements, until 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with popularizing the so-called intelligent systems emergency braking: it is calculated that a sinister on four with the injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detect obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it means increasing pressure on the putting, if necessary.
If it does not act, and although the collision is inevitable, the facility is the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
