A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre sees it as a myth, stating that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, the Republican lawyers have reported that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments passed from 2009 to new laws making it more difficult for the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw it add 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the single year of 2011.
The new electoral law requires that voters have an identity card photo and proof of US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce periods of polls, invalidate the right to register as Polling Day and withdraw citizens with a criminal record their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state requires voters to present an identity card photo.
Indiana was the first state to ask such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities moved rapidly to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card photo.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card of health insurance.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million people to vote, do not possess photo identification cards issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
However, it often costs more than one hundred dollars to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions affect disproportionately young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the ID card photo.
Much more.
The students, voters considered voting more for Democratic candidates, are not permitted in several states to use their ID card photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of the fishing or hunting clubs who vote more Republicans to use for voting cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
Moreover, Republican legislators have sponsored legislation abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the rights of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns have contributed to record approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 pushed the registration rate of 17% of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of polls.
For example, during the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while they accounted for only 13% of voters in the state.
The same was true with Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, whites made up 76% of voters accounted for 46% of the electorate voting in advance.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters were strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of an identity card photo.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Critics Democrats denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed, and they see it as a clear aim to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system.

Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What to do even more reluctant men already reluctant to undergo screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We sought the advice of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these data and firm recommendations.
Another study found a difference in mortality between patients who have had a screening and those who did not.
The study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that was between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if it is not detected.
I therefore recommend the test out of 50 years, or from 40 years if you have a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once it has detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are sleepy.
We really need to understand the patient the degree of risk of cancer, by offering options, treating not necessarily prostate cancers that do not affect the long-term life, and instead, in these cases, for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are detected cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We will suggest active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, it accurately determines criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend still to pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether or not we should go.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool that makes it possible to assess the PSA test.

Prevent disease
There is no magic recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If no one smoked, the rate would improve to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This greatly harms the health of people.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," deplores the André Beaulieu spokesman.
Encouraging: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer fell by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also encourage the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity a lifetime protects against colon cancer," it is said.
Food
The agency also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
Too much, it raises the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
Also, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of the meat by smoking, drying or curing can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explains it.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one of them was a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another was rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"To pass a screening test, it does not have cancer."

The Higgs hulled
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs has created quite a stir last summer.
It is believed that it is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely sure whether the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and it looks a lot like the Higgs predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but it still lacks data to be perfectly clear.
Suppose it is the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is.
There is, in this world, a law absolutely unavoidable that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you will be hurt.
Yet even though particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that she, too, a law of this kind: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "state" loosely consisting of some of their characteristics.
Physicists classify the particles in two categories.
In a corner, there are good citizens appointed fermions, who wisely adhere to the principle of Pauli.
And in the other bosons, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they may well find themselves in the same place, at the same time.
These particles are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, for that matter) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: mesons, that will not be, and the "particles of force," by which the great forces of nature spread and that the Higgs would be somehow related.
These particles, it must be noted here, are not all creatures as exotic as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to an extraordinary banality: the photon, or "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge is accelerating or changing direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field here, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" is a photon of light or infrared or ultraviolet, etc.), and this is nothing other than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "with force."
More stable field
The same is true with the Higgs, the difference is that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, just as if it were a frozen pond that only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator such as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 kilometers circumference! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are not all particles, or all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, but not others - a piece of paper, for example, never takes itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (like the photon, wish) did not.
Now, what is "can bring" all these searches, asks Senator Plamondon?
For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions.
They are also a strong desire, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plugging some holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oops!).
But we did not find such differences at CERN until now.
Impact
The impact of such research in the daily lives of ordinary people, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not.
Consider: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, Bell Laboratories, never suspected the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing of the rest.
In fact, we have already said fire the physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which has developed the first continuous laser (the first was clean), in 1962, at the outset the laser was seen as a "gimmick."
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, in the course of its work in perspective.
This sensor, although it was not his original intention, now serves as an "eye" in digital cameras in the world, and won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
This does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...

Palliative care - The best way to die.... |
With his death in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly while a bill is being prepared.
However, in this vital area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment.
The prostate cancer that had left him a two-year respite.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years ago," he said, figue mi-mi-raisin, lying in his bed at home for palliative Victor Gadbois, Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease is a huge weakness which prevents him from travelling alone to the toilet, and even eat alone.
Sat in front of a delicious lunch, he agreed to get help to eat, resigned.
Courageous, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are around him give his medication, offered him a bath.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I am recovering from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man, it stands up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor Gadbois.
Back at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept the regression, he says.
Because, in the view of many people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the heart of this regression.
Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum of three months of life prognosis.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called curative care.
For Ms. A., 89 years ago, the worst fear is to die "conscious and stifled."
But the disease showed me my children.
"I have good children," she said.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says, before accepting that he poses a mask to help him breathe.
It expects in the next few days, a final visit to his son come from Italy.
Victor Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and assistance to food.
Palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make it more comfortable death.
In Quebec, there is a bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know that we all end up dying a day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions," said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
In the dying, we will accept mouth brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, it was used as a beer with Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it was his son who finished beer to the feet of the deceased.
"We help them as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of health care.
At home Victor Gadbois, the days go, but are not the same.
Alongside an old man of 93 years who savored his last meeting of family in the courtyard, well suited to his pillow while Pain in his honour, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after any attempt to survive.
"For the past six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by cancer aged under 45 years of age," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor Gadbois come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, hospital or nursing home.
And several agencies, such as Victor Gadbois and the Society of palliative care at home in Greater Montréal, specializing more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in health care in Quebec who fear several physicians in palliative care the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by leaders of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health care system in Quebec is not good enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before it agrees to carry out euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spent 14 days in emergency rooms, in great pain, without the need for relief.
I am afraid that patients do not want to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists are fighting on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
The survival hopes of Helene Richard were already minimal when she gave up challenging chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I stopped treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stop fighting," she said.
Yet, she told me that I was finished.
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thanked caregivers for not having acceded to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for palliative care at home in Greater Montréal, patients would be resistant to the treatment of pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors have resorted to palliative sedation, which amounts to numb the patient until the time of his death, either intermittently or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to euthanasiiez," this means "I want to be relieved."
The achievement of this story has been made possible through a journalism award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from roads, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and experts from the Italian mafia tell every day what they know of a formidable "system," a mixture of the building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
An "industry" that has cost us dearly to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It is curious as the system waned since it took the big ways," hangs Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former chief of police in Montreal.
It is through him that the scandal erupted in 2011, by means of a thorough investigation of corruption related to road work contracts in Quebec, in which the Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had agreed reluctantly.
The "report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, he said, the only Department of Transportation would have saved $1 billion on contracts," some réfrénant their instincts to receive a share.
The Commission "has already toppled two mayors," he says, in the hope that she reaches "demonstrate the tricks behind people."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government.
The police "Pauvros Squad" which, since 2009, would have led the "cartel" of Montreal to put the brake on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, it has carried out raids in the series and brought charges for fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resign from his post as mayor of Laval, third of Quebec City.
He is suspected of having pocketed bribes in exchange for public contracts.
They are formally charged by engineers at the Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, Tony Accurso and Lino cundeamor,.
He has raised eyebrows by explaining to the Committee on the mechanics of the "system" to obtain public contracts.
He himself has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who reversait money in Montreal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. cundeamor, sowed all winds in the 2000s, with more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also said he had organised a collection of illegal funds for the former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts that it inflated costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was running smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, former engineer in public works, has been detailed before the committee: in 10 years, he has received gifts and invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and bribes totalling 736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts that it inflated costs.
Other road officials admitted he was spreading the raising of 30% to 40% bills, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget fueling its coffers with dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected from Montreal to pull the alarm.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-desPrairies, east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million developers, booming real estate.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation that will eventually be put in place, she said that she "draws on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pinpoint the culprits."
The process, she says, is "painful but positive."
It is in the process of cleaning the wound, but it should be an investigative unit in Montreal and a day before, not to return the dubious practices.
As is the household.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned about the role of elected officials aware of the ruse, " when they do not trempaient in the politicking!
Believing that 70% of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he hangs: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations, but this will not change, he said: "As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocated a complete review of the system for granting public contracts and financing of political parties: "We cannot go lower, go to the bottom of things, with courage, will help to rebuild the house on more solid footing, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to watch in their own backyard....

"The MTP is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new scale with the MTP.
Why is this progress?
It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the MTP.
Great players arrived.
Every day, I was making progress on their side.
The technical staff has also been good.
On a daily basis, these elements lead me to raise my level of play.
And, in the game, it's easier.
Everything is going very quickly in football.
But I am not excited.
My debut at the centre of pre-formation Clairefontaine to my move to St Etienne, I always advanced levels.
Therefore, you take advantage of competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer recruits are accustomed to playing matches very high level.
They also know that every training is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face and to provide the maximum.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He is supported by assistants such as Claude Makelele, who was playing in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great deal of experience and has won a lot of titles with upscale clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
So I was going out of a series of injuries.
Trust me also explains my performance.
Do you see the first part of the MTP season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We are going to try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in response to very good European teams.
First, we want to finish first in our group, with Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
The MTP can become a major European club in the short term?
It already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the GMP provides the means to make this happen.
In League 1, did not win the title, as the last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, it was really committed to pocket this champion.
Last season, it has not gone far enough.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
It has been a very big season.
It was finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much?
It is normal that we expect a lot from us in the light of what has been invested and the players.
It accepts completely.
After that, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to us, it is certain that it is a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more.
You can never win 4-0 every weekend.
It is not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a project for the game.
A team is built over time.
It has been demonstrated in the Champions League that they could attend.
Look at Manchester City that does not happen, for the past two seasons, to qualify for the 8th finals, they have also made huge expenses!
In the light of the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead of the truce.
It was neglecting our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, have been "turbo-charged" by this new MTP.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we can have a smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
The MTP seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better to say that there is a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals.
He came to it, and he proves that he is the star of the League 1.
He has demonstrated wherever it happened that he was a great player, a global star.
Within the group, you respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
It pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
I was committed to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab the game.
I saw things there and I was strengthened.
Today, I come to achieve good selection matches.
That's what I was hoping since my baptism with the Blues.
It has learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we must now have an exemplary behaviour.
Do you see the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the Premier League?
He has the results for him.
It is well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved its goal in qualifying for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil.
The good one (1-1) struck, 16 October, Spain is a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this clash in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.

With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, transactions identified and the costs of treatment between the stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, banking monopolies, led to the financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure protocol for the exchange of BitTorrent, which enables the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, has fallen to $2, five months later, before coming back today around a dozen dollars (prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She described bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency, such as "credits," used to move forward in a video game that you win by playing, or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two Email addresses in the manner of an Email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A series of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of double encryption key.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded exist in the book, distributed across the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, sort of interim central banker, will have the privilege to add this extra line.
It is a phase of hash file, which is processing a large file into a shorter and unique digital fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number of "chop."
The aim is to find the number that gives a special footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once found, other knots check easily that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than 10 minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to 100 millionth, leaving the room....
The difficulty of the challenge is also noted for each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen bitcoins deposits.
"The flaw is not related to the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company to pay real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB is also the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the cash is also lacking.
Weight actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the platform for blogs, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not found.
In November, "balances giants" have been launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of an instructional book on the currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile contactless payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, returning and cheaper.
The carrier manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement among the merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They only need to provide an address, a phone can "photograph and recognize," said Pierre Noizat, who has thousands of users.
There is a general movement of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, expects to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of success of this currency.

We left Afghanistan.
And after?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us.
It is the Afghan peasants we punished as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign army, such as the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they were joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will be more when the West will be more discreet.
The departure of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the hills almond trees planted through French credits, has been in the order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles entered Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban onslaught on Kabul at the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible step forward from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country FLAMES because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The most notable of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into business, seizing government land to sell the land to build the refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with huge US subcontracts.
They were addressed; most of them have not actually fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They flirted with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who won't want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones, television, and its Turkish soap operas, which present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
The authorities who will order be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already involved in reconstructing provincial militias, which will be irrelevant to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, the image of Western nations, but the United States have tried to turn it into a centralised state structure, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid.
There was no road, no dam, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This has only added to the sense that Westerners " were there to grab.
Without energy to deal with the iron ore or copper, or means of transport for export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine in Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
It will be a day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win the hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive action, "civilian-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), eliminated in 2012, led and carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and farm-rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, greedy local work, have been able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of farmland.
What are we going to be remembered, after two billion euros of military spending?
A far more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local conditions of life, very hard in these valleys often at more than 2,000 metres of altitude.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To ensure that they are free of the insurgency by foreign groups, what the farmers told me wish, it would maintain a small civilian aid in their favour, well controlled and affecting them directly.

A constitution in force in Egypt
It is a new poker of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants him full powers, he decided to play its protagonists.
Taking everyone short, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given two more months to this House to finish its work.
Nearly two years ago that Egypt is based on a draft text, several times amended which undermines institutional stability and led to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, President perseveres in his "autocratic insanity," continuing "betraying its word" and "trampling on the law."
On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a way to end as soon as possible with the political and institutional crisis by speeding up the process of transition.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short time, forcing the Brotherhood to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians.
President, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time.
Especially since this recourse to a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers," these supposedly due to expire after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, Islamic majority, voted against the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing.
Mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing it had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise.
In order to ensure that the necessary quorum, 11 people have been added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Commentators have been amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was done improperly.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Objects of all the attention, Article 2 finally remains identical to that of the 1971 constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "principles" by "the rules," which would have allowed stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a sign of goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," are liberals, who see it as a communication.
Because according to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar university an advisory role, particularly with regard to verify the compliance of laws with sharia law.
According to the expert in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is worrisome because " people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next president of the university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no religious involvement.
With this constitution, it remains within the framework of the civilian government.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not scholars but academics, some trained in the French system " temper Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, because the words go to religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question could in future be the extent of the civilian judges are competent to decide on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is widely criticized because of the powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that they are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, as requested by the associations of defence of human rights.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be fatal.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, the press in particular.
Moreover, no article echoes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President was scheduled to speak last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will march on Saturday.

Note: you can bathe in the Red Sea even winter, because the water temperature does not drop below 21st while that air can reach 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even more hot and you can swim throughout the year.
Incidentally, it is the sea most unique in the world: it is the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below the sea level.
The blue water contains brine and retains very easily bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are a surreal beauty.
It comes to treatment of salt water, silt, sludge treatment and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of the ancient world
They are kept by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Egyptian and Greek legends of antiquity.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists particularly strolling in alleys that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.

In Jaffa you can cross newlyweds from photo of Israel and even other countries.
At Caesarea, a town of King Herod, you can stroll in the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the crusaders.

"Language in Moscow will:" migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and activists of human rights polémiquent on what is going to give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their sole purpose: to earn money to help their families back home.
Since 1 December, a law entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass an examination of Russian.
For the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, services to individuals and retailing.
However, over time, promises the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate his language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of the countries where the Russian has the status of official language.
People who have obtained certificates or education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law.
Profit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Institute of Russian Language Pushkin, the University of the friendship of peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other institutions of higher education in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities across the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened across the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews has been supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, the defenders of human rights have already repeatedly raised the issue in the press: what is it going to be?
What is the obligation to know what the Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants?
First, meet representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work."
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers," said the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service (FMS) in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of the rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of organised selection will solve 90% problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, the prospective migrant is intended to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping, will give him a "trip" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of others have been tourmenteront for months without food and without paper and will have between 12 and 14 hours per day.
We have received many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they promise one thing, and when they arrive, they are wrong, you take their passports, and they do not affect the planned salary," confirms the Head of the Directorate of migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
I do not stop the police!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn money in Russia trust that they know not only the language of the country where they wish to travel, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
This is obviously not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to take even a primary education fair.
Indeed, their families do not even feed their children without talking about dressing properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they hand.
"You feel diminished and weakened."
Defenders of Human Rights noted, however, an important aspect of the law relating to the language.
The exams will be directed only to migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal review or work thereafter.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then, you can get a false registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police officers know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, where cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," said reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Do it quickly, unhesitatingly and buys a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Law on the language, it was discovered that the registration papers of the migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The falsified papers come out of an ordinary printer colour.
Of course, their new owners do not have for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of the power and defenders of Human Rights agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper."
The authorities can provide migrant workers who have not been able to validate the test for the first time to attend language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know the Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.

The Ministry of Interior is not dealing with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Interior is proposing to toughen the law against civilian carrying weapons.
This is the authorities' reaction to recent incidents: whether the shooting at weddings or the massacre organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who has made seven deaths.
Police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raising the legal age for obtaining firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who has promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced to the State Duma in the near future.
Everyone is not pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screws."
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various fire centres, require abandoning "this senseless tightening."
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of laws concerning civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from buying on the black market.
According to them, can be found in Moscow today any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior says that it controls the distribution of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: the plant at the officer
The black market for weapons supplies via several channels.
There are five main channels," said retired Col. Victor Baranets, who served 10 years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screen shot from a site taking orders for weapons
The first is "the military trace," i.e. the weapons that have been stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," said Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market were stolen by criminals to law enforcement.
Baranets explains that it is both stolen from police stocks than those stolen directly to the representatives of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of them have often suffered explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires were started deliberately to conceal the deficit," said the former military.
For Baranets, the arms manufacturers are for something.
"You see private arms factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," said an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of pistols and rifles from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes a mafia was formed and organizes supply," said the former military.
Where the weapons?
The experts have assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was set up in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of the problems and study for public administration.
Experts have analysed the reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data relating to weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain researchers, comes from the military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of the weapons found on the black market was found "in the absence of employees whose work is related to weapons," it was suggested in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons from military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "excavations."
A vendor and consultant who requested anonymity ensures that long ago nobody buys the weapons found by these specialists in the illegal search; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will seek new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a teaching unit, for example, a TT pistol.
The book by passing the goods through a fence.
"It flies in the city and sold it to 900 per unit with two chargers," he said.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, for example, when crimes are on the verge of being investigated, it makes a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers," said the vendor.
"Like a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer are usually in the form of knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a type occurs and I propose to come to the station of Begovaya where someone was going to get me into a corner to haggle.
The price of the pistol, I was given on the spot
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, it is important that I know someone who has a contact," said the vendor. I know somebody, but I don't trust.
There are sellers in the markets, but there must also be said for example "of the person, who asked me to convey that his daughter had lost a tooth."
Now I buy a pair of American fists in a person to whom I am confident.
It gives me the book only to me because he knows that I am not going to give.
Small new seek weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets was tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid 1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything you want."
"I thought I was in a luxury store," remembers the military.
There is no secret to the buyer," says Baranets, you can try.
As a potential customer, I am not happy to buy, it goes with the vendor in the forest and installing a target.
"I have learned, and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, we are starting to negotiate," describes the expert.
A shop since his sofa
Search engines display sites and Vkontakte groups where you can buy weapons "for different purposes."
To this end, there is no need for any document and person to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise amount of money," wrote advertising on the site "purchase a pistol or a submachine gun battle."
Users can leave their applications and raise their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without a permit, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"TT buys Moscow," wrote "Fedorenkov" in its very direct request.
The Federal Security Service released a huge network of fake sites and collect people who want to buy weapons of war.
People are rushing food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, a military observer and former
I have heard of this type of patterns: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of application of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payment on the kiosk.
"It receives back a photograph and instructions which is hidden the weapon," said the secretary of the association "right to a weapon," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find themselves without a weapon and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service released a huge network of fake sites and collect people who want to buy weapons of war.
"People are rushing food like hungry wolves and then they are to exploit coal in Siberia," he said.
Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, say experts, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "right to a weapon," you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100 - 300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
He came out of the warehouses long term by the management of these mid-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the ministry, compared to the period January - October 2011, the number of these crimes has declined in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while confirmed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs fell by 7.8%.

USA: employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests is rising against the low wages of Wal-Mart supermarkets and famous fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take off or weaken quickly.
These actions are supported by unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In addition to the modest wage increases that perceive employees at Wal-Mart and the fast-food chains, the organizers of the protests seeking the creation of trade unions.
For the time being, this sector is not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the "black Friday," when a freak rain seizing of millions of people swept across America and sometimes triggering clashes.
On that day, some employees of the company Wal-Mart, which employs worldwide 2.2 million people, have left their positions to organize picket lines with the unions and the left-wing activists in stores in the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and middle classes.
Wal-Mart sells everything: layers to shotguns from car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid workers at Wal-Mart shop solely on their workplace.
The price and the choice of products have made Wal-Mart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Wal-Mart can afford to sell its products cheap, particularly due to the low wages of its employees.
They are also complaining about the difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants of the events of "Black Friday" demanded a salary increase, they complained about the fact that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased by 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Wal-Mart, which affects 9.5 cents per hour, it is an amount that it cannot afford.
Scientists from the California University of California at Berkeley have shown that if Wal-Mart increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than what it currently spends.
If Wal-Mart put any increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store would amount to 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only 12.39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Wal-Mart note with satisfaction that the protests have occurred in only nine states and there have been no harm to the group.
The "black Friday" continued in stores from 8am to midnight the following day, and Wal-Mart has sold 5,000 items in the second.
Its funds have made at least 100 million transactions for the "black Friday."
The company's spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post that "fewer than five employees of Wal-Mart had left their positions and that the protest was a" communication operation " of the union organizer.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not Wal-Mart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, that is why they are not yet implanted), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces sell billions of servings and after you do not even sick leave and you do not pay the work you have done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under the federal law and New York is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing with time, but few average employees are New York 8.90 dollars an hour.
No one affects less than them in this city.
It is inconceivable for me to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wished to stay for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with them.
On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal includes comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you are going to feed them.
The demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 of the McDonald's near the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks are paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than two times the current minimum wage.
They were also set up unions in the area of fast food.
The US law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters from a union by bullying or layoffs.
However, the administration rarely simplifies life.
For a union, grab fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They disagree
Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast-food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the gathering in the middle of the day of the McDonald's near Times Square with the intervention of several local Democrats, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announcement to sell billions of servings and after they do not even sick leave and you do not pay the work you have done honestly!."
The demonstrators were supported by other Democrats New Yorkers, including by the candidate for the post of Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that " we must all support the employees of the fast food they get a fair wage and economic wellbeing that deserves every New Yorkers.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the largest ever fast food throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people attended all were not employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is now difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small.

"For the moment, there is only moderately to deceive the brain."
Recently, fans of the new technologies have become accustomed to seeing reality increased through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google, which unveiled its current model at its annual conference in November, we learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the group of interactive 3D technologies of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Dr. Shahram Izadi, scientists from the company, the glasses are already history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his hands, through the creation of virtual open spaces.
You could say a few words what your research group?
We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and we are trying at the same time to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole remained at the moment to pixels on flat screen and sometimes touch.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox are sold today because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture.
We reserve the future?
- Although it has made the physical interaction, a lot of things go on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the time being, not really.
We are trying to change that, and we are working on imaging systems truly 3D operating on different technologies, including the projection technology.
We need to get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, making it more tactile.
To this end, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world of virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about the voice?
It is appreciated, but isn't overrated?
We cannot say that this is the panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we did not always want to inform others of its actions or its intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet gestures, restricted.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn in the hand that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce the size of a clock.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + votes.
-?
- For example, how would you take this bear?
You would do with words and gestures.
Usually, I speak only.
- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.
Therefore, you want to force users to adjust depending on what the machine can do at a particular time?
Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify the reactions of human beings.
It may be an example of laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If you are interested in your work on the Xbox sensors, what you don't like in the modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, it is on the current generation that we use in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously get approximately 8 megapixel with a speed of 1,000 c/s..
But the problem is not themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to the last point, all current technologies are pretty good, it adds to the designers of algorithms.
It should be borne in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed is very important, too, the number of executives in the second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond gave the touch sensors on a regular schedule between 1 and 100?s, the current sensors are closer to the second value (60 - 100).
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction of man and the machine.
I need a device of this type in my work, but do not need to touch, to have more executives in the second.
But we don't want to increase the number of cameras?
- Now has three "cameras," one is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the signal thought.
And the third camera is actually a normal sensor in the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that a point of view of the daily use of technology in the augmented reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the greatest prospects?
Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone hands is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transitional" augmented reality that you would from a platform to move in the smartphone glasses.
The glasses are a very personal device and that's their strength (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality glasses won't get you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of holographic virtual objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark Iron Man, but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea are pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands do nothing!
What answers your group planning in relation to this challenge?
In my course, I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be adding tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as a medium of image.
It is perfectly the pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute the palpabilité to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasonic beams directed towards a specific point where the finger and that gives you the feeling, for the time being still weak, a breath of fresh air on the ends of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of fingers, they are also an axis of perspective.
- And you have tried to mislead the brain?
To make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
There is still a job down here on which it will take a long time of evil: how to believe someone who is physically in a space so small that he works in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of race carpet (nothing to do with those found in the fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, there is only moderately to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.

The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.
"Rosbalt" continues the project "the vanguard Petersburg" dedicated to city dwellers who find themselves in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This list has already hosted prominent players in the arts of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city and found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is the painter extrovert Kirill Miller.
The entire city is Kirill Miller, this rather bearded, dressed in red that can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in festivals and exhibitions.
The tables of Kirill Miller always bring together the crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.
He is one of the storytellers at fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a distinguished representative of the vanguard Petersburg in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, smiling people and good humour.
He has recently taken in his hands a barrel organ and it has become a symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had sufficiently matured in this difficult role in his life, his philosophy and his image of a bohemian.
Kirill, why do you tour the city in red and yellow or turquoise for example?
I chose the red as a designer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
While in society, everything that is not grey is aggression and a negative unrest.
But my provocations are intended to begin the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you realize that you had to be a painter?
At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my work.
I understood that this was my path.
Then, the wave of old unofficial painters grew and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I started to tie my friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya" and then there is no wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
And it ended up in your art... - it was important for me to be at the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg, where must meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took Pouchkinskaya housed before a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian Petersburg.
Many were born: NOM, Tequila - jazz, I can still see Chnour come up with the project "the ear of Van Gogh."
Chnour and his friends sang songs easily playback in skinny shirts, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer now in fashion.
When the group began to live, it became "Leningrad."
Trakhtenberg drove some emissions before the Gali Hali era.
We have given Trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is here that he has received.
"D137" floor, "Griboedov Club": this is the impact of the artistic Clinic.
Our employees are parties as accustomed.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: it was the "personalities of our city."
I was named "artist of the year," and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
A lot of my paintings are hits, they have a current and a very strong stance.
I will have an exhibit "the Russian museum through the clowns."
The clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was somebody, now it hurts and scary.
But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the full and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the dress that is important, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Perhaps you can't give him a hand, but instead he spit in the face.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
Recently we have seen in the role of the organ player - a cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else I can play.
But perhaps commercial art can also be beautiful?
Today's commercial art must be treated, delicate, sweet.
A disintegration of culture is happening.
Before, people were divided into herds, supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the dumb one.
Today, everything is divided into small communities, it is hard to please everyone.
I am not a ticket of one hundred dollars to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you love it.
Each star has 100 fans.
But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhaïlov!
These are people who come to see is the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and ultimately less management, money, everything languishes.
I have my fans, the main thing is not wrong, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted tables that a collector has hung beside Falk or Larionov's.
I started with the usual tables are those that are painted in the end of life.
Today, it is often confuses ideas.
It is said that there are spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money specifically for painting.
I am for this culture.
Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the culture official.
But not everyone can work in culture.
During the reign of good, it wasn't like that, Tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are now good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who may be experts, but they are excluded because it requires higher experts who will assess correctly these experts and their fraieront a path.
At present, it is the "reign of taste" which flourished.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take all contemporary art, there are painters who have to find other museums.
For you, what is St. Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture, there is a ground for this.
And on our stones, art has struggled to grow.
We need a cultural soil, and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there is a lot of curious who are going to see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art in fashion, as was the case at the beginning of the last century.

Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with land aboard are searching for a backup planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to keep our species in weightlessness or on a planet of relief?
I believe that there is little choice.
There are two true planets that can be won, even by hypothesis.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the Institute of State astronomical P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If Mars conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
We cannot live at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
It has begun to address the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
There is still a century ago, it was conducting experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit in no way differed from earth varieties.
Then, it has been put in orbit insects, small breeding Drosophila flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo in weightlessness.
You get to exit a chick quite normal.
It is then that the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick needs to find support, it must be put on their legs and begin to move," said the director of the laboratory of the Institute of biological problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev.
By finding no support, chicks stirred disarray.
And after 10 hours, the new born saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks were neither light or sound.
Unfortunately, they died just at the end of four days.
"We have been witnessing the eyes twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The latest biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the "Bion biosatellite" ship that species of the same sex.
There has been an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, we have discovered nothing supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites and then it is the only experience this kind of research is needed," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it does not yet make reproductions directly into space.
This is not a simple matter.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to carry out their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, human beings are capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a proper emotional substance.
This type of experience is not made for ethical reasons.
But women go into space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what humanity is more valuable.
Our seagull went up and no one on Earth could not say whether he would after a flight in space.
If she could give birth to a child after the flight.
"Nobody responded to this question," said Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaïev was also astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice in orbit and have worked even axiomatic, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have little, even very few cosmonauts who had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this poses a danger even during the flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union and Russia hero, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity.
Laboratory hydrology of the Centre for the preparation of cosmonauts: mandatory step in preparing for the flight.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts train for extra-vehicular exits.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment for infants, it is their true element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Insofar as the baby grows about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the mother's womb, it is easier to get used to water.
It is in principle logic, because since its birth until its first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a nutshell, if the child who is born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitational force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis decreases very quickly, the ability of the baby boom is lost.
OK, do not know that based on birth simulators.
It is of course preparation for childbirth in a special chamber, the woman will get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite them to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
If he does not feel the Earth's attraction, the agency does not form the skeleton and the muscular system.
You can't wear an infant as an adult with a special combination for workouts.
It simply will be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would seek in this case by imagining the birth of a child in an environment abroad will return to Earth of a disabled child, fully désadapté, provides for the Director of the Committee on Bioethics of the Institute of Medicine - biological problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still theory.
However, with time this will become reality, when the world will visit their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.

The head of the ISC (Supreme Audit Institution of public finances) said: "The control of the pseudo self-employment (Czech"?varc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has qualified inspectors and quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in terms of its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala said, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Institution of public finances in an interview with Aktuáln?.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking for us," said Kala in his comment on the current situation.
An inspection carried out jointly by Czech and German inspectors would also suggest similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "?varc" by Petr.
Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS would not disturb contractors with controls; it is therefore permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent action authority to inspect to demand compliance with the law," notes Kala.
During the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-Polish German project which has been compared the legislation in the field of public procurement of these two countries.
What was it in practice?
It is a parallel control that we have launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, the European legislation provides for how to manage the procurement and specific national legislation as well as an actual practice.
We have collected and although this monitoring procedure is not yet complete, very interesting differences emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be "tougher and better," however, according to some parameters, the practice itself is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to continually develop increasingly detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.
How does this project can help you in practice and that is it for you?
A common control of this type should help ensure that we get to try to clarify the law, to reduce and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, we will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will find a lot more opportunities than if the threshold was higher.
You talk about internal problems regarding the implementation of the procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organisation?
In terms of institutions, similar to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly, there is also a board constituted a little differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally similar.
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance, however, compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it is also at the level of the Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.
Public funds managed by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the accounts.
With regard to the national legislation, is simpler than ours?
I don't want to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but we cannot say that it is better in all areas.
This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison.
However, we must also say that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, not?
With regard to the national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are already being felt?
The amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet impact on our screening operations.
As we make control afterwards there is some delay.
Our observations relate to, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new tool for "risk detection of mismanagement" with which we have vetted nearly 14,000 public markets - of course, these changes will be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so forth.
Do you consider, therefore, the adoption of this law rather as a benefit or a burden for the administration?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm.
The problem that can happen is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the regime of the previous regulations, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forces controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of the budgetary discipline.
Is it useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not this way, I think.
The system should exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decisionmaking process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
What is the solution to get out?
Look where we are not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with control of the so-called?varc system - what does that mean?
The?varc system is prohibited or permitted?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent action authority to inspect and require compliance with the law.
He can say: "We are going to change the law and authorize," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing had happened.
The law on the market has relatively strict rules on formalities to be completed and precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking at home.

Roads are frozen places, but most remain open.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
The network remains largely practicable, in some places with greater vigilance.
Karlovy Vary region
In the region of Karlovy Vary, roads were this morning, but by frozen places and also snowy.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5 and -10°C, but they should increase slightly in the day.
The snowfall ceased in the region and in the plains have only a thin layer of snow.
The ridges of the metal (the Kru?né Iron) are still covered by about 30 centimetres of snow.
According to data from the regional maintenance of the roads because of the fog, visibility was reduced places.
The R6 fast track and the national roads in the region are now passable without difficulty.
Vigilance remains, for example, on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All roads and pathways of third category, including mountain roads are also impassable.
There are still some sections of the remains of frozen and places slowed down by traffic.
Especially in areas located in altitude, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice, Hradec Králové
Roads and highways reported on its website that some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and snow packed by traffic can be found on the roads in the mountainous areas and located in altitude.
The maintenance of roads warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region located in altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan?kroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poli?ka, Svitavy or Tatras, mainly on the road and third category.
Roads I/43/34 in the vicinity of Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is primarily in the Giant Mountains (Kokono?e) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické Iron).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn??nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by traffic is present on the roads in areas located at altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the time today will be dry, most often reached with potential cloudy.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will vary widely between -3 and +1 C.
Pilsen region
Roads in the region of Pilsen are now passable, although, in some places, it is necessary to exercise greater vigilance and adapt its behavior to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures ranged between -3 degrees.
After the recent snowfall and cooling that followed, some channels of communication can be frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, visibility will be improved gradually.
This is what it appears from the information of the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway goes almost without difficulties, maintenance of road communication recommends greater vigilance between 80 kilometres and 131.
The lining of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the district of Pilsen South and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental channels and third category are wet, and in this case applies the warning against the frozen sections.
Drivers must be vigilant, and that particularly on roads less crowded in the area of the?umava.
Olomouc
Drivers travelling in the areas of the region of Olomouc located in altitude must now count with a thick layer of snow and soft on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "?ervenohorské sedlo" and on the road in the direction of Videlský k?í?, after the chemical treatment.
The snowfall forced overnight maintenance of roads to travel on the ground, according to the services in charge of the roads, it fell more than three centimetres in the district of?umperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are passable without difficulty.
"On the heights of the district of?umperk are remnants of snow.
Drivers in the direction of Euracademy's should expect "?ervenohorské sedlo" a thick layer of snow and soft, " said today ČTK the head of the maintenance of roads in the district of?umperk.
Their colleagues in the district of Euracademy's went up during the night, according to them, after the chemical treatment, roads are now open and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are passable with difficulties in the district of?ternberk drivers should be careful in the sections in forest areas remained wet.
Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, the maintenance of roads in North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
According to data from the police, in addition to certain areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero in lower altitude, and thus the snow and ice should remain on roads in the plains, particularly in the south of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem, and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems were reported at the moment.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, especially in the vicinity of?t?tí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for his training: rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
It also points out, since the main axes of movement, difficult conditions on National Route 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to tree branches bent under the weight of the snow to reach the road.

Ornest?imon said: "Together, we want to collect the positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love to fall.
In our group The Tap Tap rather laugh and say that we are the only group able to collect the remains of positive energy in order to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you climb in December, a project quite unique: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you provide more detail on this project to our readers?
It is a charity that we are preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11 10 o'clock in the morning.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will be completed almost as ending the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, a time zone ahead of 12 hours compared to us.
Who has had this idea?
Initially I think it was my idea, then we have developed with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, think about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and the original key to the end of the world, by buying them online at tap. People can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled "end of the world canceled" (Czech "Konec sv?ta zru?eno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will hear it at these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in three concerts.
The anthems also will join at a given moment in the context of a live broadcast, quite unique, Czech television.
The lyrics of the song were written by Tomáš Hanák who is also the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We are working with other Czech showbiz personalities, due to the fact that we hold many concerts and charitable events...
We are trying to engage intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and it's fun.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with limited mobility and which we are working to achieve in the framework of the Jedli?ka institute, with the association Tap, and that for the past six years.
Teachers visit regularly with students from the Jedli?k?v institute and propose activities that interest them and play.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli?ka Institute, we will transfer this project into a new independent building.
Several music groups and performers will perform on stage in each of these concerts?
According to what criteria do you have chosen?
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, will perform on stage Chinaski, Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jirì Suchý.
You can find all the details on: kpks.
Also prepare for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the context of the Prague Spring; again, we will surely have a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once in place in the United States, I'd like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle the organization and logistics of your tour?
It's not so terrible that it looks at first glance.
We have five members in the electric wheelchair must travel, of course we also trimbalons a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has more or less always gone,?SA and British Airways were always fully prepared for us, they have surprised more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access for people with limited mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards the disabled and so on.
What were your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than for us, we have just witnessed in Moscow that is still in an initial phase.
In Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to disabled people; there, it is not yet aware that a person moves only electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
They do not yet consider evidence to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there is also an association trying to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created.
How do we still catch up with the more developed countries?
There is a lot of things for which we are still lagging behind...
It is important to mention that the improvements and developments always depend on the efforts made by the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy handicap moving only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, at the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are the contrary at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will start to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians and famous lawyers.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years ago, what you drove in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli?ka Institute, where I was surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am a musician (I play the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music business.
And then, with time, as our moderator Lá?a Angelovi?, we have a little lost control of the situation (laughter).
The success has happened over the past few years, if I am not mistaken?
This is true, to create links with singers and work actively in promoting the group helped us.
We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to subsidies from the European Union, in addition, we can afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so forth.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of tips that mimic each other.
In some ways, it is logical: everything is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who we see for the first time is, of course, it is natural....
But the pity is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
These are people who can live a life full and flourish, provided the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities are able to do something, this is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole of society.
Is that your success is not due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you are qualified by a lot of people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it is quite normal.
Some people come here with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize that they need to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group who wants to work and achieve goals.
The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Lá?a Angelovi?.
We are an open group, people come and go, you can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or wanted to join us.
It will be the case on the eve of the scheduled date of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 from 21:00.
This action will take place in the Incheba arena in Prague, Brno at Fléda and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when jointly sung the song of the group The Tap Tap "end of the world set aside."
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre which is located in the Jedli?ka Institute in Prague.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the tickets are open to Bohemiaticket.

Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as a 20th member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full fledged member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had engaged in close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed has been involved in a number of projects in the agency.
Poland's road to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they were not always understanding.
I would like to mention the conference of A.?ternfeld at the observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from her pioneering book "introduction to space travel."
The development of this young engineer (born in 1905) left viewers cold and years later?ternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski turned his attention to his work.
In 1934,?ternfeld won France's Robert marques and André Louis Hirsch for his book "introduction to space travel."
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) became a big propagateur of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagateur of the world-renowned astronaut, his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Since 1925 was built in Poland a hand car intended to be equipped with a rocket engine.
There is, unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or curb the hand car.
The only known information on the hand car are those of the press at the time.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to focus on the rockets.
The research was conducted by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
According to the documents that this research had reached the stage of the trial.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the searches were interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a hunting photoelectrically rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozi?ski, appeared in the press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna rakietobomba i lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were aimed at military use of the rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects using the technique of rockets were being carried out by the Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo - Naukowy"), who coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the start of the war ended.
After the war, other work on the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish company Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a question of a company in the November 1954 issue of the journal, in which there are four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to space travel
At that time, artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research in the future.
At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish company Astronautics (PTA) efforts to enter the International Astronautics Federation (created in 1951) and as early as autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice president of the International Astronautics Federation.
He kept his office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the ATP made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1,800 metres had an 80 cm long and weighed slightly less than 5 kilograms.
Subsequently built an improved version, RM - 1A, and during summer 1959, flight tests of the two-stage rocket was launched in the desert of Bledov.
The rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kilograms.
The next prototype should have been able to make concrete scientific work - the rocket par-34 should have a range up to 14.5 kilometers and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was halted.
The Meteor rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, led to the first rocket.
The rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kilograms.
Three models (called Meteor 1A, 1B and 1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor rocket - 1A had an area with a volume of 0.4 per litre, whereas in Meteor 1B this volume was 0.34 per litre and Meteor 1C of 0.62 per litre.
The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 kilometers.
In the period between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor missiles were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight trials started in October 1970.
The Meteor rocket had an initial weight of 380 kilograms and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kilograms at an altitude of about 60 kilometers.
Subsequently they built the Raytheon versions - 2H and Raytheon.
It is still necessary to mention the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland has also been involved in space exploration on Soviet space satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second Soviet cosmonaut program.

The repeal of the law on utility work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public works.
This decision was raised in the public a lively discussion.
It is certainly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with a financial excessive speculation.
The significant differences in the price of labour (wages) generate tension on prices.
It should be put under this term the following meaning: a producer attempts by the importation of goods sold cheaply to withstand economic competition by making it more expensive " the price of a competitor, in order to remove a greater share of the market and to increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy at low prices, or disappear, the result is a high unemployment in the countries where prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that the private capital has no responsibility from the social point of view and thus responsibility for unemployment it creates, payroll taxes necessarily increase.
This intensifies the perfect unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the social and economic damage to the whole of society by this race.
This situation is so well known that there is no need to provide concrete statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital are resulting in different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of the private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is evident mainly in the amendments of existing laws.
The aim is to compel economically its own people to accept the diktat of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This happens through a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is a growing poverty and deepening of differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there has been for years public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common that employees receive such salaries that the government is forced to pay extra to ensure that they reach the subsistence level.
Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economy of virtually all Member States in the south of the EU are, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), either to eke out a living with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital investment in their country.
Here we have to ask the question: where will this capital?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty from one country to another; this capital may not come, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media say, that the state cannot make capital investment in its own economy, that the economy run led to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital in favour of the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
Then you have to wonder if the private capital does not influence, and even does not today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and the entire state.
The answer is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby and present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, by granting mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is wrong, but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that because of the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are adopted in the Bundestag.
The entire power does not come from the people, such as the Western-style constitutions, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented towards liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the Crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Julius Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long been deteriorating and functions were assigned by violence.
The blows of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The kickbacks and corruption have increased without limits and people went to the elections with votes already sold... the honest people were unrelated to obtain functions, the result was once the state was 8 months without Consuls... "' really began to say that the solution to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man..." it is true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who has transformed irreversibly democracy in absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal benefit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and promote the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, now as in the past, a decline of elites, without any effort to carry out far-reaching reforms.
So we have to look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, we can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, social and humanitarian crises that we are now witnessing, as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by the old and recent history.
The repeal of the law on utility work is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of reforms referred to social policy, which will strengthen the capital of the state in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.

Israel: laboratory chaos.
"Nothing ever comes out of violence and never will," says Sting in the song Fragile whose main refrain is "let us not forget how much we are fragile."
"If my son did not want wars, there would be," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on her death bed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions were high.
Some take the party of Israel, citing its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and recognizing Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in his recurrent waves of killings; in short, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view located "behind the curtain," benefiting mainly from the tensions that persist for more than 95 years (starting with the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small piece of Middle Eastern countries.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others have emerged from my own understanding of that, or rather the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the story of a struggle for power.
Each time, we can find Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals were acting independently or if they were to their acts to the throne to someone who led their actions in terms of objectives set out in advance.
We must admit that we live in an era when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration powers has not been able to do in the course of a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader, but I do not excluded).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they have acquired the first World Press Agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious crimes to which they were involved and who had always meant for a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth, or both.
They have major holdings in almost the majority of the world's central banks and preparing or waging wars against countries in which they have not yet such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq 5, after the overthrow of Qaddafi only 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America, the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war of its own money (I'll) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to make money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to file a lawsuit against the EDF for triggering the economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level led in 1859 in 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated in the 33rd degree, the highest level.
The first war was designed to eliminate the big state monarchies in Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, including British, and the third is expected to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing other than the beginning of such a solution), and in the end, acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (ab chaos - chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to ensure that there is no repetition of the crises such as those they began in 1907).
Having managed to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Russia in the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly by a German surrender without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they have imposed on Germany to a war reparations creating the conditions for a radicalisation of impoverished masses (then they only need to put a sufficiently forceful leader, pointing the finger of blame, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who was to play the role (she was actually fifth column to set fire to the powder and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration above laid the foundation for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the initial friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had initially held; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a fire area that can lead to a third world war.
If international bankers are able to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab population or Muslim generally in the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a mistake causes another mistake in a circle of violence without end and where, at the root of all the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the world?
It should make the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because like us, international bankers do not propose to people in the elections that their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascisant politician, fair to international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) spread to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20 percent of the world's oil (this corridor has a width of 2 miles) and create a destruction of the global economy.
What light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which any new born is implementing birth an electronic chip to be completely controlled.
"They are all individuals, large or small, rich and poor, free and slave to bear on the hand or forehead a trademark red iron, so that he could not buy or sell anyone who does not bear the name of this wild or the figure of his name.
We need to understand: that the person who has common sense figures in the wild.
This number refers to the man and is six hundred and sixty six."

The Argo film: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamic students stormed the US Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which backed his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer to the US administration of positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was able to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, compounded later by the fiasco of the attempted release of the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate was in the United States, a wave of solidarity and a feeling anti-iranien.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The Argo film, the actor and directing Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory for America.
Just before it is occupied, six employees are out of encirclement of the embassy.
After complicated events, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get out of Iran through a daring coverage: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a team filming location for the filming of a blockbuster science fiction film.
Gender mix
The expert in slipping Tony Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines of this film, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices.
Details of the operation remained long secret, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The Affleck film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a political thriller designed realistically, but also a "we movie," the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - such as, for example, in the Ocean's trilogy eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The move: Tehran sequences documentary style (subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs from the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these pictures, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences).
Lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration.
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has been able to restart his career in a remarkable manner.
Ridiculed actor, he became a respected stage director and his player has ceased to elicit wry remarks.
Argo is his third film after the dark cop "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film that is not taking place in his home city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that put his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck is also proof of this sense of the atmosphere in Argo, where the role of Tehran "is bound" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film takes place in streets, during the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the collapse of the embassy is impressive in its clarity that would suggest the confusion and unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, wrote a page of history.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the false shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many shares in too many places
The film and stage director has had to contend with a few exciting scenes in the film sense of the word.
He fared very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a phone call in America and the prosecution on the airstrip are fairly drawn by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood members, their characters deserve a greater place and it is not far from here, only in this case.
The film Affleck lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he is a moderate interest, enjoying the achievement and the styles of the 1970s.
It leads to the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet, somehow, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services, such as omnipotent and omniscient, it is the case.

Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server: bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts each year a public inquiry into the bank charges the most absurd, decided to launch the competition or ideas from "EU workshop" the most absurd.
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40% of women for the management of large European companies has been at the origin of our decision," said the newspaper Právo the organizer of this investigation, Patrik.
Some of the nonsense mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision by the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women were better off in terms of insurance rates on life because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year, any other idea incredible "the workshop of the EU."
"The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013," he advised.
Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuel, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of chickens, which led to the increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of using the term "butter" or withdrawal from the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or a group of states (and the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that in the European Union, bananas must not be less than 14 cm or present an "abnormal curvature."
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonise national standards not homogeneous complicating trade.
The standards for fruits and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some Member States, claiming that the existing directives are a waste of food.
The first prize will be awarded to the settlement of the EU in this investigation last year that must appear on the balloons a warning that children under 8 years must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has made reference to a US survey that balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of death of children by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years in terms of blowing trumpets show.
For us too, we have bizarre ideas.
The following rule on European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "let" association of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.COM has appointed in this investigation, in addition to absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for the supply of food products that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic was second, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risqua, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey have found interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the granting of subsidies.
These ideas are not from Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact of not having a sea.
We will ask the European Union a refund." as expressed in the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, because of our production of wheat, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state got full stocks that he then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
At the end of the day, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and held a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies for obtaining grants have been proposed in the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel N?mec (US - DEU), they should, in practice, be used to write requests for grants from Brussels.
The EU states: "The bizarre regulations are rare."
If the regulations often provoke criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by the EU in terms of regulation and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development, deserve more praise.
More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the European Union, fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific designations for these traditional products (which it does not always wins) has been an emotional issue for the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have defended successfully the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky," in which the name "Tuzemský" which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák."
Only the alcohol of cane sugar, not sugar beet, can wear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products from the EU, is now in the company of world-famous cheeses such as feta or Gorgonzola, the Luebeck marzipan or Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the Poho?elice and in carp ("Poho?elický T?ebo?ský kapr") and hops?atec ("?atecký chmel").
The gingerbread Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "mid-1865 Ho?ice" ("ho?ické trubi?ky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.

People want to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator
Senator, how did the idea of standing in the presidential election?
This is not to be a senator or president who counts for me.
If everything was operating without problems in our country, I am not a candidate anywhere.
But I no longer bear to see it as the country has been plundered for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under the locks and taxes and the age of retirement are increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't want, then I try to find a solution to that change.
And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation to come to the Senate or presidential elections.
You entered the Senate, but you quickly put on the road to the castle (N.): seat of the presidency.
Do you not go back to those who have elected?
I have always said that I am in the battle for the Castle, according to the results of the senatorial elections
Subsequently, I pointed out that if I were elected senator, I will come back to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument which will allow me to realize my vision.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the broader mandate.
The problem is not just that as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of our television, but it is also that we are stalling those who are trying to bring change.
This is the press that breaks the reputation of people and freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it said in my speech I soudoie journalists or that I was the adviser Jiří Paroubek.
Turning to your visions.
You have begun the fight for the castle with pet projects the themes of the physical and criminal liability of politicians and tax returns retroactive beyond 20 million CZK].
You have to change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a citizen, I have pushed for the activities of a tourist guide as a liberal profession, I have won.
The problem is easily outmanoeuvred: when someone comes from left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused, and it delays the citizens.
As an independent, a member of any party, I am much more likely to win the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able to, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take each party what is best for our country and implement.
You see yourself as a man of the right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people are rather left.
For me, whether a little left or right, this is not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me, it is not that people are left or right, but to bring people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the public good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party, or ODS, and I am equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you enragez when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But what you said does not prove?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and a vision.
You try to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about have been applied by the world and experts have spoken.
But without the support of the parliament, it's only a slogans.
You do not long survivrez in politics with it.
Do you think that if you go to see people and tell them, you will succeed, for example, to impose the physical and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to get to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the physical and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should eventually explain why they do not want.
When there is a strong personality that will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct suffrage, it has been achieved through the pressure of public opinion.
I must admit, bluntly, being an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and my views.
I just throw myself into politics and I am trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I try only to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I will stop in six years and I will return to the private sector.
It's a bit like if needed to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, that's why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to come to the Senate elections.
I met with participatory Jan?ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I gave the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who revealed the fraud.
I came because people are really upset, but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of people did not vote and, for the most part, given their voices to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, there are only two independent.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, such as the election by direct suffrage of mayors and governors of regions.
Do you plan to base your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the history of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial resources.
I have no money for my presidential campaign, I only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You do not have money?
You talk about tax returns, what is yours?
I think about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I was in Prague a field worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth around 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda SUPERB with a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, was compromising with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth $60 million, and you do not have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
I should go into debt?
I have already invested $2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not a great deal of interest.
I have no obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I will receive as a senator.
But I could not live, for example, pay the English school for my son, which costs 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I did not introduce myself to any election.
You will continue your business to be able to live?
Did you say that you would put your activities in the background?
But this is not related to the amount of such remuneration.
As I have promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will spring the direction of the travel agency.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But even though I live in something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my business.
You will find this interview in Saturday's edition of the newspaper Práva.

The architects of the MVRDV office show that the real adventures are not just imagination. To convince, it is enough to look at Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly built - 2 photos
"I think it's funny, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a busy on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a nearby large company, said: "Yes, it is actually nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, nobody goes voluntarily in one of these libraries of yore?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons in the brain drain, the city decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful miniature small reinforced concrete painted.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
As a result, the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to resume the hand on the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, the architectural firm of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold diagrams and creator of buildings witty and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and ran the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
And while the members of the jury is still watching, bewildered and shrugging his shoulders, Maas, the brash, his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech arguments activists backed by a "common dear!"
This is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse books, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros poured out of land.
The building is part of a revitalization project including an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books has received the second prize "Best Library of 2012."
In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this small town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian mall and a mayor of a staggering ugliness, whose white facades suggest they contain a dairy, has grown from a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to the a-value
First impression: paradise of the book under bell cheese.
Of course, an elevator brings you back to the heart of the massive, but the real joys of a-value and architecture are open to you when you stroll through the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.
The interior entirely of glass is bright and clear, soil in Dutch bricks and elegant street lamps speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It is already looking in the eyes of the public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball.
And all of the books, books and books.
"Normally, library shelves are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," said Willy Maas.
We have completely disrupted the classic spatial configuration and open spaces of a-value from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully constructed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes paneling, railings and stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers in the building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trouborst, head of the project from the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
Thus, one day we found in a farming business Frisian an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, it is used for years of the synthetic membrane thick as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then you can throw.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, including the smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the stairs 105 is the top of the mountain.
At the end of nearly 500 metres, the literary cafe offers a stunning view of the city, but also of Dutch nuggets and potted ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but above all, they contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of moisture in the air of the literary mountain.
Donations for the new soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in the field of ecology," said Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books lies under a glass bell, the sun lights up little time inside, even the days of good weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted over the facade of glass are used, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already been risky to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there too.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, described the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the time of the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This has helped to fill the gaps in the library, which was not yet fully furnished (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The shelves are full of all sides.
For the architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if only for decoration."
As a result, MVRDV has reached the discipline known as, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity."
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though it may seem young and poorly educated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.

Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany has chosen the abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of the Palestinian observer state to the United Nations.
But then, she has chosen the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the US position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention in the vote on setting up a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Germany is finding it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually defined by the Americans and to establish a German policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the European Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore face a number of fronts.
It is expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think they are still finding their way to find this role, but are on the path of a foreign policy "more normal."
A foreign policy, such as France or Britain
That means the term "normal" foreign policy for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to take positions independent from those of the United States and European partners, including in relation to national issues.
I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: this is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and abstain from the vote of the United Nations?
Germany has first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That's why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a key element.
However, I do not give too much importance, because it is not exclusively one-sided relationship.
But in any case, this is a key element in the German strategic thinking.
Germany affect its relations with the United States by choosing the abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Maybe Germany will only be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions about the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice.
Opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences because of the US domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course not defend his position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they always seem to be.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiastic about the policy of Netanyahu.
Germany is finding it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other hand?
I think it does not make things easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little bit easier for the Germans if there was a European policy consistent and uniform, but today, this is not the case.
They cannot register within a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will assume in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, particularly because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been tricky.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that marks more independence.
Germany is playing a role player in weight on the international stage, Germany wants to play a key role?
Or is it always difficult to assume leadership roles?
Germany is still not accustomed, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
If you look at, for example, the crisis of the euro, we note that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many antiallemands sentiments are heard.
It does not make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this perspective, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must deal with neighbours and very varied opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the United States' influence on the European policy is diminishing, but at this time, the EU does not fill the void, then who is?
The Germans will only need to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less popular, that's life!

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really?
Behind this name is a trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand is such that the company that bears the name cannot complain.
And even if she could, it is not sure she would win.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of the right of property in the Far East.
Each week, a new record arrives on my desk.
Imitators need only a few extra letters to be able to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, there are Lu - Gucci and Prada, there are Prada - Kny.
German companies are also copying legally, such as Puma, the sportswear manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a folder where registrations from the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company has filed trademark Zegna TE Puma, a name that the firm was artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It's a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of the copy and the violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are malls on several floors selling and only counterfeits.
The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its constituents to deal with the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "bang Mingpai," parent brand.
The term is derived from "bang Dakuan."
It is with this term that are designated women who marry wealthy men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," demands Pattloch.
"The mark is watered down, the uniqueness disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to the flagship expensive products.
According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third largest market for luxury goods and the one that develops more quickly.
However, it is not easy to write off the dubious records of the register of trademarks and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports on the trial in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name had become a "market reality."
Pattloch says that if the complainant has no chance, he may even be forced to pay money, because it would have been detrimental to its brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of construction machine Sany, the same company that had bought the producer of concrete pumps.
That is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, Volvo Data-Loggers, used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely was forced to change.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against Même in Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits having experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have spent the last year of an "emergency situation in the course of the work in a restored normality."
For example, the number of opposition procedures untreated would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been closed, representing an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding at the office.
Act expensive
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million applications for the trademark, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a record and this means that China stands for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the rankings for the number of new deposits in the world.
This should also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each recording reported average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle will cost much more, as illustrated in the case of the German family business chain.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese trademark chain.
"It is our fault, because the family names cannot be protected in Germany," said Hanno-Ring Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the objection of Munich.
Freudenberg has won two following bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praised the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he added: "The procedure is long, difficult and it costs a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archives department has even had to review the actions of the last 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the other side a "lot to six figures" to resolve the dispute.
"This is what we can see what it means for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over to Europe.
This would be the case if the region's imitators ensured the exploitation of unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name of Freudenberg in Germany for a company to produce footwear and leather.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is."
Pattloch and advise the German companies to exercise caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on the international trademark law, foreigners should also register in China everything that is likely to be protected," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as explained Wentzler.
Or we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question.

Day World AIDS: foot-stamping, sing, help
The Imbongi choir repeated in Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland welcome their arrival.
This is the story of a relationship that is much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, the slap of the foot: the cowboy boots, sneakers, ladies and moccasins for men seeking the pace by striking the ground very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers escalate slowly - viola, bass, tenor and soprano, they win, and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years almost loses its canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flexibility.
We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeated a new song in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 came, the geneticist in human medicine man at home.
"Om' Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir member has different words, in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland.
Be helped to help
UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa."
70 of them are enrolled in a high school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount ensures the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the center.
Imbongi in Zulu means "storyteller of stories" or "praise singer."
Nobody can speak Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing.
For nearly 10 years, the choir repeated songs in the foreign language she has worked in Germany for now in his native region: southern Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers bird of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people
The village has about 2,000 residents, some of whom live in modest huts of straw or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 among them are orphaned because HIV won their parents.
At Esitjeni, we can see smaller scale what ails Swaziland: the rate of HIV infection is the highest and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population never accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees yet proven a reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the immunodeficiency virus, and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of the thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir was able to discover the village, the Imbongis have seen many children in the street which lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At the outset, it was only a few people who personally agreed to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer a hot meal per day.
But barely a year later, the choir was "Voices for Africa," an association that has since almost professional AIDS orphans to Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted disease?
Bacterial infections include syphilis, chlamydiées and gonorrhea (or gonorrhea).
The current infections are HIV, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic infections.
What are the main groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur among men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men are responsible for at least four out of five reported infectious syphilis cases in Germany.
Heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydiées, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
Among young people, there is a rate of infections related to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections are young people aged 15 to 25 years.
Moreover, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure rose from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is decreasing.
In 2011, there were approximately bonus cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth compared with the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital urinary pain, loss, pain in the lower abdomen, and the emergence of buttons and warts.
However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can we protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or physical contact.
Experts recommend to anyone who often changing sexual partners to get regular exams.
Most of the infections detected quickly can be cured, and the late effects can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all the funds that reap the singers through their voices throughout Germany, accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of themselves, who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are housed in one of their grandmothers, for example.
There is the so-called old Zulu women, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and ensure that they go every day at school in their uniforms.
The orphan is greeted in a safe place for Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 starving children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two barns. With the assistance of the US health organization PSI, the association has organized a HIV testing for many people.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is visible across the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," said Annette Lennartz, "because it is an issue that affects sexuality."
It's pretty curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in the place of democracy.
These mores sanctioned by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
There are condoms on every street corner, "says Annette Lennartz," but almost nobody uses it.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choristers are travelling every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people on the edge of the black continent are still having the time of apartheid.
The bus full of white singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it creates not only good humour and joy, but sometimes also squeezed a tear to a few formidable guards.
The bus always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light," say the people there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies, back in Heidelberg, in front of these singers who tap their feet in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Strasse, there is also light.

Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The layer of ice could reach 20 metres thick.
The agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains water frozen, as explained in three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet constantly immersed in the shadows.
This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 metres.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids may have hit Mercury.
However, no link between the discovery of water and the assumption of life on the planet," said the chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the ground, such as small cracks through which we look at infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and pink, more difficult to identify, are the "babies" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this area where stars are born, called "W5," a little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, about 6,500 light-years away.
The Spitzer telescope NASA has photographed the bright glow of a star dying.
The doughnut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star plans when she dies.
In the vast Trifid Nebula, discussed light-years away from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope has photographed this galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades cluster of stars also called "the Seven Sisters," can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope is putting more colours in value.
On this infrared photo, the Propeller nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
His similarities with a terrestrial continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared camera can observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that has disappeared, there are 4.5 billion years without trace.
One of the largest and most photographs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope is the galaxy of Twister.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spirals can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three streaks of dust divide the gleaming heart of the place of birth of stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of murder: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies merge rush one to the other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Space Telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname of "wheel of fire."
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Céphée.
The black hole is 1,400 light-years away and is composed of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the current house dust.
This photo was developed using optical and X-ray photographs taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle composed of black holes, which is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies known as Arp 273.
Scientists have named the greatest spiral galaxy "1810."
This is the group of the brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives rise to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are linked by the Rosette Nebula, also create permanently young stars at 8,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
We look at the universe: major telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo utilisât a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to make savings.
The diameter is about 11 meters.
The drawback of the method of economic construction is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the level of the vertical angle.
Its uniqueness lies in its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small diameter mirror, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescopes in the world.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
The telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") using the computing power of his machine.
The Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large telescope every Large Telescope is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive height of 42 metres, it will be composed of nearly 1,000 pieces of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory to observe the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of the mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration makes it possible to admire.
However, the images of the most important space from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, we book images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope is looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found $1.235 planets since the beginning of the mission.
This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will be tasked with finding the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole is also home to the ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists because Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole.
Radar data indicated that for decades the presence of ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the probe in 2004, the first orbiting around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.

Drink daily butter, and live up to 168 years.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young at 97 years old.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young at 97 years old.
The trip to the mountains Talysh is an unbridled romanticism.
Looking at the many twists of the road, the small bus cahote along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, looks almost like in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres.
It is here that saw the Caucasian ethnic group in the name of Talysh, about which little is known, except that they are fluent Persian and Azeri and they have a great longevity.
Terminal: Lerik.
The small town plastronne with its overly aggressive architecture of the Soviet era, which is not in keeping with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 miles because the road has only one route.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country needs to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
"Baku became famous in May, thanks to the Eurovision contest, and the next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," said Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
There are the lives of about eight dozen Talysh in the region who have more than 100 years, Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years.
Still have a child at 136 years.
But the controversial star of the museum is?irali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And when you think that the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems to be more than questionable.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and he would have been 23 children, at the age of 136 years, he would have even designed a daughter.
?Irali Müslümov would have erred in calculating his age of a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, he has also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia.
"Surprisingly elderly people also live in some parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia, too, there are men who are incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no record of marital status.
Every day, a glass of butter
It is nevertheless a fact that people in the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years old.
What is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the Talysh energy-dense meal, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the young people? Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives in Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years old, it is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor beside a churn, which she beats content tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also have in the house.
In the kitchen, preparing tea for guests served in armadus glasses typical in the form of stomach.
The Mirzayeva white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hiding long braids of a dark blond that his son reveals with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and so I have never lost and they have kept their colour.
"I have never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything has improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He has been in power until 2003, his son succeeded him thereafter.
Whatever the case, the elderly do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives a monthly 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps the long greying son of Mirzayeva is right: "Seniors have a great respect in our culture."
They are the centre of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.

"Human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution has surfaced in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep divide in the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not a man of few words full of emotion.
We need to make a successful transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on television.
His speech was aimed at the entire people, but especially the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslim and secular.
Because all members of the opposition confused and desperately divided fear.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, having temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its own "in order to save the revolution."
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, holder of a doctorate from the American University of Southern California.
The judiciary will be overthrown?
The 234 articles written in haste by the Constituent Assembly muslim of 100 people during a nighttime tour de force of 15 hours are indeed worrisome to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft stipulates that the jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does the word "principles"?
It was, and it is always a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the legal leeway resulting to apply a more strict interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case suggests a newly introduced stipulating that, in relation to all matters relating to Sharia law, the Al-Azhar university must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance shines across the Sunni Islamic world.
It may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative process, resulting in de facto guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is likely to maintain the military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts tried to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 13,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also can be read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its moral and its values."
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the state could even control the content of film art and literature.
Clearly, it is simply censorship.
Moreover, no article does not expressly guarantee equality between men and women.
Instead of it, another article forbidden to offend or defame the Prophet Mohammed or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what constitutes an offence or how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people."
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many points are subject to interpretation in the project that will submit to the vote, which, in his own words, will "very soon" the subject of a referendum among Egyptians.
"The revolution from"
The opposition rallies for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual accord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down Sharia law before it enters into force.
"The revolution is rising and we are going to win," says Hamdin Nasserist Hamadin Sabahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history."
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of trying to foment a "coup against democracy."
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been purged," said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its annulment.
"The Koran is our constitution."
Meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, has called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was held at the University of Cairo.
Veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people call for the application of the law of God."
"It cleans our country!," asked, saying that "the Koran was their] Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place, where it all began, would have quickly created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what the supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, as well as his supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box in the direction of the country.
The Islamists' project certainly will win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once."
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed which should have been extended until February and encompass all social forces.
Counsel for Human Rights 48 years old and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or the courts under Mubarak.
He did not because he shared their conception of the world, but because human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was subjected to beatings, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he laments during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy, and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president makes it de facto all its powers," says Saeda.
However, a democracy cannot function without organisations of civil society.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could afford.
A protester on the spot warns: "You family of a monster that you will not be possible to control."

The Norwegian rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway are one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.
The secret of the country's success could be linked to the local appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of football wet and dirty clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes in Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours of Oslo.
The snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled salt and fermented in water for a period - depending on the smell that you want it - which can go up to a year.
When darkness settles and that it is cold, the Norwegians gather in droves to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," said Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter full-time, the so-called "rakfisk General" responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and don a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to the rakfisk," said Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting under your nose, it is not bad - it sounds like a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels of water in the air, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once fermented fish came out - and undoubtedly undermined by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country there is not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, although fragrant, from Norway.
This makes use of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost $10 each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not for him.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about the killing, they talk about "the incident on 22 July."
The Norwegians have difficulty in accepting that in their peaceful country, one of them could commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the sole reason that justifies our success," says Anna, our waitress, the blond hair and a blue numbing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plateau of rakfisk in hand.
We are - how can you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to point out.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution, except for a small percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, over the years that have led to the financial crisis, Norway has managed to keep it tight.
"As long as you can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," said Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I am standing in the snow and I am queuing up to buy food - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger consisting of momentum, a real discovery is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where there is rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a knot butterfly, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It is like the Eurovision contest.
"What have you given to the best fish in the mountains Thor - Juergen"?
"This is our points, Havard."
You hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it is because of the fumes of fish.

Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto has experienced a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, addresses the difficulties that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, who are numerous.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a barrage of security has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching the Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the helm of the nation.
A complicated task ahead.
Mexico's economy is well, the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is facing a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very crowded and sprawling gripping the capital, on his land of choice, views on this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is enshrined in the memory of all.
Locals attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of Mr. Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once deep and full of cracks.
Plaques bearing his name hanging outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to implement lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope a real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years without power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is a lot of expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
It's a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image of their former governor.
Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under the autoponts highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of the city of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military has been called to the rescue in the fight against drug gangs that are rampant in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, was found on the edge of landfill, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggle to hold back tears when she shows pictures of his dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version of a suicide by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed," said the Lady Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and rigidity grafts had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana covered the wall, beside a cross containing the word: justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
I have been treated as if I were an old gossipy, a hero of disorder, a pleurnicheuse.
They want to accept what they say and remain silent.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto will receive her scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made the promise that he would make his priority during his term.
"I hope it will be as good as president when he was governor," said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of the Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.

Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, say prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning would have been a victim during detention.
The trial focuses on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning took place in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have tried to show Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being at the origin of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the US military -- has missed many opportunities to complain about the abuse he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that the case be closed because it was done in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were subsequently published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
During the hearing Friday, Fein discussed with Manning forms that officers had met after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum appendages from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers have asked questions to Manning and recorded his answers.
When Fein spoke about the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment of his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had been in the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms showed no complaints of abuse, although officers have directly questioned about his prison treatment, said Fein.
Manning said he had orally expressed concerns about some problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not documented the problems.
"They have written" no problem " (after having addressed the concerns), and this does not mean that I did not raise any problems," said Manning.
The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, has also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months ago.
Manning said that his intention during the meeting was to amend its restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury."
The military said they had assigned this restrictive status -- a level under close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted people to know that I was going well, and I wanted to withdraw this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life, from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the U.S. Marines at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had contemplated suicide when he was in Kuwait and fainted again because of the heat.
He added that the fact of not having been kept abreast of what he was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon in the cage," said Manning, on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects available were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
He has tried to stay in motion, because sleep or stay open during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned the night, they woken up in order to be able to see his face.
Counsel for Manning filed a formal complaint for the treatment of Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also Friday, the judge asked questions to Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- after being forced to sleep overnight in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time, he was allowed to be covered with a blanket during the appeal.
During the judge's questions Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of his custody that he had to drop coverage, which would have been able to conceal her nudity, but he acknowledged that no one ordered him to surrender.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to get hurt, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences during his detention and that it will greatly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted by court martial, a trial should be held in early next year.
The defense said that Manning plans to plead guilty of less serious offences and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.
If all charges are retained, he could face imprisonment for life.

My identity crisis Mexico-U.S.
He said that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind Mexicans of the difficult times," he said.
Navarrette said that Mexico and the United States are caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two ways: one for the " " (" Mexicans "), another " (" Strangers ").
I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing what put me.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It is an ethnic epithet, in the same way as the one that my friends in Boston are when they say "Irish" or my friends in New York when they say "Italian."
Then I became "Mexico City American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the land that saw my grandfather, no need for a special word or hyphen.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I headed to the "Strangers."
I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of both countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than go to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half of their territory at the tip of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an official US formula the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about the way the Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of Montezuma are seeking the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country has with more than 35 million Americans who live in the United States.
You want to address the issue of bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, one person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person was a typical profile -- a dark-skinned, educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are living the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in, and not the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We are in the United States.
On the other hand, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class, we do not like.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them a humiliating defeat and we stand beside as if we were inferior and not enough Mexican strain.
Our Spanish will never be quite good, our relationship with Mexico will never be quite strong.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families did not fail when they lived in Mexico, they would never be gone.
And we would be stuck on the right side of the barrier, comfortably living in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States when she was a child, I am reminded that there is friction between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans, Mexicans strongly assert their identity and Mexico City - Americans are upset.
Although US citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexico City - Americans that I know do not appear to be part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we are regarded as Americans.
And in the United States, we are regarded as Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship, as I have learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexico City - Americans work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a wonderful country we must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
This will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And, considering the wage inequality, corruption and violence linked to the drugs that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You will have to fend for themselves, amigos.
It's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States in the way they have treated Mexico there is a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexico City - Americans always want how family members were treated there is not so long ago.
Hmm.
We may be more "Mexicans" than I thought.

Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will never be a lasting peace between the Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood seems to indicate that such hope is futile.
While there are still the same futile argument about who began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring is breaking up, and like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Maybe their struggle will escalate further.
However, there is every reason to believe that it could help them to get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that is no loser and no winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have reinforced the supporters of the strength of both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has suffered a beating.
Killing some of its leaders and expelled the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has been rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a booming regional power, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, took for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Members of Hamas are and say that the growing Islamist bends around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where Hezbollah exercises its domination, via Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can topple Bashar al-Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a despot who has ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are relying more easily to the public.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player who will not be ruled out by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of the hard line of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.
The interceptor missile system known as Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness, and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly at night - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket attacks from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, notably through the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in respect of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party two-state merged with an even more hawkish party leader Avigdor Lieberman in the runup to the election on 22 January, was the beautiful part.
Why there's Palestinian state?
If they were running the West Bank, do not launch rockets, as their countrymen have done in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hit them as soon as they leave the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will prevail; but it may be that the Arab spring is changing.
Even if the Islamists take power in Egypt and elsewhere like Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
He has worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world, which is becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer is advocated by reasonable people from each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now try to stop the flow of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the next proposal for a state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama has also any interest in what Israel has agreed to negotiate.
During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.
This is a very narrow view.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This involves a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

The laws for neutral packages of cigarettes came into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of sick bodies cover the dark green packages that are all the same, regardless of the brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark green olive and horrific pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking from their parents.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages.
This is the most stringent regime in the world in terms of tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government said that the aim was to discourage young people from smoking by removing any glamour representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26 years, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, the children understand the message conveyed by tobacco companies through their brand image," said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown that children associate the crown of a logo for a princess. "
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rates in the world, and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law.
Tobacco companies have said that it would boost trade in the black market, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"The negative consequences of this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others have said that this law boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, such as silicone to mask the horrific packaging, has increased significantly, there are two months since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost in the High Court of Australia.
Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, say the experts, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites.
"If you are working in the tobacco marketing and that you don't have more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the place of excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens in favour of the marks on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and bother to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new regulations in place rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new court decisions - these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar legislation on the packaging.
Canada was the first country to make mandatory warning photos on the packaging in 2001.
At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these pictures.
The photos don't bother.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you screwing the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package containing a photograph of the mouth tumour.
To be frank, the only reason I will stop, this is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the tobacconist Pack" in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on the shelves.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a package now, I need four hours," said Yu.
"The government had to prohibit once and for all, and we would have said OK, it's good, you stop and you put the key under the door," he added, by lifting the arms to the sky.

In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
As a result, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I am not going to lie.
Spend a day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and to distract you (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in the child's development are praising boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - bored from time to time, they say.
This would force the brain to borrow interesting paths, or even to feed creativity.
And as for the most part, we are constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we embrace boredom?
Yes.
And not.
But I will come back to this.
First, like a lot of people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, "said Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of" Boredom: Lively History " (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The problem goes back very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are graffiti depicting boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through numerous publications and submitted the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have identified boredom as an experience that is "to want to do something, but not to engage in a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the boredom of apathy, he said, is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task that she would like.
With apathy, he said, there is no desire to do something.
What is at the heart of the problem, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, coupled with a gloomy mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can strongly resemble a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be related, people who are bored tend to think that the problem is the environment or the world, while those who believe that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes, we sometimes think that we're bored when it is actually a matter of concentration.
As part of their study, "the Unengaged Mind: defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard from the room beside her too much of a TV show who had no connection, others have just heard the TV, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack.
Those who have heard the TV at a low noise level said they were annoyed that the two other groups - they have had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you make a boring task, "like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you don't get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that when you are wiggles or scrawls, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to space to learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay quiet," said Professor Fenske.
We all bored one day or another - the delay in my flight, a speaker with a voice lacking in sparkle, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "scale of susceptibility to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "one of the tasks that are performed, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of many and varied stimuli.
But in general, adolescents are quickly blase.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32% of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their duties at home, while 23% said they feel bored when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3% of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of today's boredom, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reached its highest level," particularly because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I based my question: boredom is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take physical risks absurd, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way that the brain has found to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But if you look at the TV, you will be happy in the short-term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give it an iPad, it gets lonely, but he has not learned to deal with alone or autorégler, says Professor Fenske.
"This autorèglement move from a situation to another," he said.
Your child learns not only to entertain, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I do not think that we should glorify boredom.
Just as I do not think we should criticise.
Feel comfortable outside the constant ferment that generate business and technology is the goal to which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to annoy us more often, but boredom evokes an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that has meaning," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops."

In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and football player in Colorado, has been indicted for something that will become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were aboard a car in Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that can be used for minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the Colorado vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use is more dependent on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been closed.
The police have ceased to charge adults 21 years or more for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors who are in the more conservative districts in Colorado have called to speed up the existing cases of marijuana and continue to prosecute those who have.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains now vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana approved by the state in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what lies ahead," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also quite a few questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a system of permits, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in the area of regulation on marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes, and now in relation to personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, acknowledges Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington law, which is called 502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal void of a year, during which the system will not exist yet, while the possession of marijuana is legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees an adequate access to marijuana approved and prohibits the installation of shops selling cannabis within a radius of 30 kilometers around a school, a park, a playground or a nursery.
"There will be no more difficult than urban areas to install an approved trade sale of cannabis, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legalisation of cannabis, a research group formed recently.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, Aurora, sent an Email to his officers announcing that the "attorney City" (representing the public prosecutor) no longer would pursue those 21 years and older who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop charging people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Prosecutor of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, primarily to pressure on users to wean.
At present, 119 people have been charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to take legal action against those persons who have committed a crime which, at the time of the facts, was an offence recognised," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited use of marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer scheduled to appear in adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the public prosecutor in the county, Pete Hautzinger, has supported this decision, but has also decided not to drop all cases of possession of marijuana.
"I don't have the impression of losing my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, providing a legal framework and appropriate government for the personal use of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various US cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and speaking as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (" national organization to reform laws on marijuana).
"They have spent much of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, too, have difficulty in accepting that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited use of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and representatives of the state are planning a new frontier of legalized sales, they are waiting with concern the directives of the federal government, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will.
Despite some high-profile arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has enabled businesses of marijuana for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police will probably not break down the doors to seize small packets of drugs, it is likely that it opposes licensed outlets of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Even before the vote, some local governments have approved moratoria on the creation of new businesses selling marijuana, even if it is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the town of Montrose received a six-month moratorium, and should impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.

Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not just today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to the University of Oxford.
My father and my older brother have studied in what was a prominent place for me to know, a sort of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after being installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to do my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were puzzled.
The newspaper of the Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room beside mine.
The author A. Wilson said with quirk that I was having been forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled because I had been a victim of intimidation and has been the subject of constant bullying.
Not because of my name rather outrageous, or because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in the cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was a victim of a racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very good idea influential of Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you might say.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-right students will suffer the same kind of persecution.
Growing hatred and institutionalized Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Student Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative in the university's Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("the country wonders: young, Intelligent and Right"), dedicated to the policy among students, and portrayed the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It was the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)," which travels by Rolls-Royce, wears a full silver and travels with a cane chrome head.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats for the implementation of the increase in tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20 years, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, "said in a Sunday newspaper" that there is a bias left growing in universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even we have met."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in history at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR to the people who are centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the wellbeing of its members," she said.
I was the only one to think during my first weeks at Oxford.
I came in September 1986, I was 18 years old and a paralysing shyness.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was highly virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations.
From the earliest days of the host week, when new students came with others and teachers, I had a foretaste of what would happen afterwards.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in the taunts to Tory students, but that they were taking pleasure.
It was as if the policy on minor strikers, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood of the classroom.
The first sarcasm that I experienced was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I wasn't prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my footing.
Pitt, a small man in the face pustular, won easily.
"Do the Thatchéristes refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
Other students laughed.
Tears burned the eyes.
"I would suggest that you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy to make friends," he launched a vicious tone.
I returned to my room, inconsolable.
At the dinner this evening, I sat alone and then I felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
It was a student in the second year of study in English, named James, who presented himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, politely.
I am afraid that this happens.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is being targeted.
It's already pretty hard for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour).
Later, at the local pub, I shamefully tried to hide.
I insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything that had told Mrs Thatcher.
This ploy failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences, which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are contaminated.
Other students echoed the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How the Tories do they love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, isn't it? "
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
I would have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
I would have been forced to meet people sharing the same points of view only after dark?
I would have had to become Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would resemble a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory teacher was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was an adviser in foreign policy of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
It was almost never there.
He hated this place and insignificant, as well as its accession to the Marxist point of view - deterministic of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You are not happy here," he said.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends who live more open-minded.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do it, not in the city to the dreamers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leaves them a chance.
I am sure that it is to tease you.
I would break the heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and waived his convictions.
During a session of tutor-supported the following week, when another professor of history suggested the more seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do so.
Blushed with shame, I admitted being a victim of the brain washing my parents and the traitai "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who drove the final nail in my oxfordien coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I was cowering in my room, and after five minutes, my rivals dropped out.
When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can treat me chicken pleurnicharde.
But no child under 18 years of age should be a victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 prime ministers Tory, but also enjoys a strong reputation for equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino prefers the elegance to fame"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture," which opened this week in London, ABC asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged at the opening of "Valentino: a Master of Couture," a prestigious retrospective, which brings together more than 130 models couture created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is "signore" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March next year, there is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino is displaying memorabilia such as trophies of his ascension: the modest designer of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, the idol of the jet set.
There is nothing wrong with people like royalty.
"At least, they do not crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet as some stars of pop music," said Baroness Fiona.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all worship be invited in his Gstaad chalet," explains the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friend of beauty of the time spent as a Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to fame.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Square, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment in the decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest was important and appreciated," recalls the "top model," which began working with him during the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never be acceptable, because his creations are works of art," end says.
Line of nobility parade
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
He loves people and with the greatest titles and also love.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium glamour of 60 metres wide, which proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and paraded on the podium to see a "public" dream with the main creations of Valentino, as the suit chose Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that was Monica Vitti in "La Notte," or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among the public models include names like Sybille Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" jacket and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection in 1971-72.
"It is a gift that I had done," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer to all the others for her femininity, her great love of women, and because it enhances our beauty," said the former Duchess of Feria's.
I love the colours he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and Patricia modeuse Giovampaola della cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
Finally, it was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward Line.
It was a red party dress with a skirt, a draped bra and a bra to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," said the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess retains the designer's evening dresses with "the utmost care, because an evening gown is not just a dress, it is also all the memories it conveys."
The "king" of fashion
The final major exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer calls and seamstresses) to carry out this ivory silk gown with pearl inlays, 12 different kinds of lace and a long tail of four metres and a half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialist press, this dress represents a historical fact of fashion from the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients of the high society."
Obsessed for years by the "skills" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani earns as much as any spouse of his clients.
"Its elegance, its quiet, neat and perfect I have always been glaringly obvious," acknowledges.
The last time I saw it was a month at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"It was perfect, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says...

The hardest job in the world: human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by wearing 70 kilograms of sulphur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom the work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living in the Ijen Kawah volcano, in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gases emanating from the bowels of the earth hardens in contact with the air.
Having collected large rocks of sulphur, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilograms, he installed in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres of altitude, but the exhausted porters are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a snail's pace, keeping the balance and not stumble and fall into the abyss.
They know that a mistake could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur extract.
Once they find their way between the tourists who photograph as if they were circus animals, and painfully heavy baskets, they walk the three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has installed a little down to everyone metres of altitude.
These are PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and you can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
It sells to 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry, since it is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and is even used to launder sugar.
"As we haul about 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," says Anto, who usually performs three trips per day.
Everyone takes 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but it allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it appears to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what he would do well in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," said the bearer who once worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (EUR 6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have returned to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years, he has spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though it covers the face with a mask and wearing special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
"I am going to work even two years ago, because I want to open a shop or study French or Spanish" promises in an English more than acceptable.
Battered by life, this young sympathetic and intelligent could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead of this, it is the work of a mule.
He shares a wooden hovel unsafe with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur does not always happen at night, when his yellow became blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Defying darkness, Anto descends into the crater with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide equipment to carriers who are working on their own account and are paid to the weight.
In addition, they do not affect a 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for the animals, not for humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old stout porter who works at Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left the college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, it ensures that he will not stop working " as long as he can, because he needs money to raise his three sons, aged between 10 and 18 years old.
I do not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life.
Although sulphur can damage the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and trap miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering serious illnesses... plus of course their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53-year-old, can only carry 50 kilograms.
Every day, he and fellow troops extract 15 tonnes of sulfur from the volcano, three trucks at the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 miles away from a goat path overgrown with weeds.
"I do not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life," said Unainik by opening the mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a bearer of sulphur.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen.

Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans cast responsibility for this lack of children on their careers, stress and the cost of access to the property.
"The people of Singapore must be developed."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, are fulfilling our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertisement for mint, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "will be open in the drawer" to make a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in an entertaining way through this advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to ensure that people meet their national duty."
It is intended solely to the Internet, so we have been able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of the birth rate, and we felt that it was a theme that we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried several things like launching perfumes to concentrate or organize speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we said the following: what's more creative to solve this problem than a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take lightly.
It spends 1,300 US dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers pays up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city-state rich and high-tech southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he found himself above 2, considered the rate of renewal, it was in 1976.
So why Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the policies of the marriage and the family of the National Population Division, said that it was due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the establishment of a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single and delaying marriage and births, which result in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy designed to drastically increase immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that is a thinly disguised against new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are accused of pulling down wages and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore has seen last year its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the implementation of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unanticipated consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore has also unintended consequences.
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The authorities of urban development have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "box of shoes," which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale has won a lot of success.
However, the authorities are concerned by the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage developers who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "boxes" are much faster than larger dwellings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much more quickly than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to developers, who have previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans who work in the financial district in the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, just like education, that's why people until later," said a young man.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says another young twenty years ago.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, they are Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.

What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private sector or "private life that we can protect them from any intrusion."
What does - which is the responsibility of the private sector for less than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to himself by broadcasting on the Internet of events that he would not be offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico questioned five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years old, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they were associated with the term "something very personal" and "the password and user name" when they have applied to social networks.
"I'm not going my most personal secrets in a post," said Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account over the past two years.
"These are very confidential, but not my mother can know everyone," he says.
I post pictures or games.
I also discussed with my friends.
"I do not share one of my photos or someone who would be the fool," he says.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 FB friends, as well as its nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority of the family.
Her mother, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to speak and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they say, I just position," he said.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with my friends, quickly," he says.
He says he will never accept the demand for an unknown person.
He will not trust someone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, MySpace and Ask, on the latter, he admitted that he did not know about 20 persons on his list of friends.
"It doesn't bother me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made advances nor asked her address or phone number.
"If they gave me the pressure or demanded, I just supprimerais my account," he says.
José has subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that are now known as cyberstalking are not alien to the young boy.
A close friend of one of my friends was extorted money from a social network.
They have threatened and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, has not closed his account.
"It has only happened in private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young posterait pictures of knowledge in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or upset.
"Even though I know that it is cyberstalking," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and Licensee Education and Learning, believes that, to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to seek information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed," she said.
Porras says Academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in education from the University of Yale and author of the book "digital natives and immigrants," uses those words to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, children and young people who are born with the technology.
"We, we are digital immigrants who must teach them, while we are learning," she says.
He added that the issue is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criteria on what should be or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so."
"We ask them to be selective when what is most important is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and teenagers confidentiality is to use issues that make us think.
"Tell them not to do so is useless," she said.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you don't raconterais to a foreigner, why are you doing on the Internet?
Or would you like to have that they publish a picture of you as a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish on you?
When you identified pictures of celebrations, requests you to other people permission to identify?
And also, everybody needs to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be on social networks," she said.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and counselor education, says that it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions for the use of social networks.
With each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to talk with their children about the implications of the opening of an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what it is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners.

The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the seven party representatives.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency said at the outset that it would be disclosed after the close of the summit, and said it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has consistently been limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential meeting with the message "private session, audio restricted" was published in the press room.
The little information circulating among the journalists were those given by the press of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more important information.
Later, the presidency of Peru has sent an Email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.
In October last year, Peru hosted the 3rd South American Summit - Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been asked by the press body, it did not broadcast the statement called the Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can verify that the document was published in the month of March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they are limited to a maximum of obtaining information.
The summit was also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in The Hague that a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the arguments of both parties in the trial that Lima filed against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and fulfil the verdict that will solve the disputes we have today before the international court," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of the controversy, treaties and international tribunals," said President Piñera by shaking hands with President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they abide by the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to abide by the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundary with Nicaragua it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was asked to open the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The agent has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the summit would "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits."
He was informed that action would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) must not be complacent but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our peoples," concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and border... by uniting our countries and generating new economic channels," said the Peruvian president in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were Peru and were on the cross-cutting areas of its territory, from the coast in Brazil, and that two were a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give more details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and good relations with its neighbours, is another issue at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these routes, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua, which will seek to have a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said the president Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the power of the new president of this country, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet first to approve the Action Plan for the year 2013, which is trying to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.

"South America must learn how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, was to take on Europe."
President Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told the state TV, Péru TV, that Europeans "were killing each other during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the proposal to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member nations of Unasur.
"We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President has been in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the United States and take into account the Pact of San José on Human Rights.
Those who have bombarded us never compromise anything, on the other hand, we have all signed.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington in the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador in the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.
Correa maintains that he did not regret his decision because he did not himself betrayed its principles, but he instead met its "profound democratic values and human rights."
He concluded that at the time, "there was suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice that demanded that it comply on its territory for interrogation about a sexual offence then assumed that "the Swedish legislation allows us to do so by videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said that there was a risk that the physical and mental health deteriorates.
"I have not spoken since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by being locked up in a small area without being able to exercise outdoors.
"This is about the health of anyone," he said.
Correa noted that the solution asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a permit that would allow him to visit Ecuador, lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and he points out that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, as the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of procedures from various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain gave the pass tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the Ecuador Embassy in London, or Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that it will not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that are harmful to freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this light, it welcomed the fact that it is not this kind of journalists "neither bankers nor the hegemonic country and bourgeois who dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than put forward his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to continue the path and draw the right path."
Correa has also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and attempted coup disguised" because in reality, "it would destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together.
It must be solved in their entirety to overcome and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court, and he said that it is "beneficial that Latin America must seize the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment so strong that it is."
In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this opportunity "with a great deal of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa assured him that if he lost the primary in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
On a personal level, I have never had interested, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty cannot be solved by means of political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who would guarantee this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term, and I then will retire from politics.
If we lose, I will do as well.
"It is my decision," he said.
Correa has also made reference to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just discussed with the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of the health of President Chávez," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support the progress, equality and security.

AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he confirmed the result of the test: HIV-positive.
"It is as if the sky had fallen on the head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement that the doctor had tried to make it "less painful" in vain.
The young man hid with his family.
He decided to take one of his illness and began to learn about him and his persistence was such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio is living with the infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
Then, even the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided to say goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient starting treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectious disease specialist and an expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not consuming drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of 200 men and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive an HIV diagnosis for 25 years, "as long as it remains under control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," said the scientist asked.
In order to put this progress in its context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of the Mexican is now 76 years on average.
If it is true that mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has risen from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients on the national database died.
Just in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we will ensure that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
So why are there any deaths?
I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never missed drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or they are learning to advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is making earlier diagnosis, and for that, we should offer screening tests to all those who request it."
Experts and members of the Council of State AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has to do its testing in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and do not want to know.
"If I am going to die, it is better than I was three times a week," they say, this is not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I am, I take my medication.
So far, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but colead, I am careful to me and the other person," said Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with Milenio Jalisco, thanks to his testimony, to help those who are afraid today, during the march of the World Day Against AIDS.
They do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will know soon if they are HIV-positive and better, and if they have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, are responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest lies in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now we packages of 100, that's very good, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
The question: "What do you do?" asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, assures the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold at counters, but distributors of public toilets and in places that are frequented by young people.
It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity.
It is not to pay their girls and the motel, said Governor Emilio González when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.

A judgment call by a US court ignores the debt restructuring of the group Vitro via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario creates a negative precedent for all domestic companies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and having solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the Stripes, opposite view of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment on 15 June last year by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargo on their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's largest glass manufacturer to capture the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case noted that the creditors will have to register under the law on bankruptcy in the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would be to denounce the international cooperation procedure in the event of the insolvency of companies having a transnational profile.
In fact, the law of the United Nations for the shortest of the International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring would not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, the Swiss Federal Institute of Faillites had guaranteed the debts.
In addition, what is certain is that, since it was the votes of subsidiaries, of all the ways the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is the "vulture" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergència, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have won the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A given omitted by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he met since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis which the United States, spreading costs in the country.
For the time being, the company of family González Sada file an appeal before the same court of appeal for the vote in its entirety, with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The use of insurance will not prosper and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, noting that the freeing of the agreements signed by the two countries to the same level as paragraph 15 of the Law on the bankruptcy of the United States.
In addition, he noted that the country has complied with the principles of the UN Commission on International Trade, the rules for cross-border insolvencies, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Pileup of two parts: they overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country.

"Hetin" Hector Reyes "basketball is all my life."
The globe-trotting basketball "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the land and, thanks to him, has traveled worldwide.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as great as "Hetin" Hector Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain haemorrhage condemns the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the OBS, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even more in the same time, as when I was president of the OBS, Director General of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit to Primera Hora home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is all my life."
Reyes did not exaggerate when he made this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memories that recall his unconventional route, show.
In the heart Bayamón
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those who recall him as a player within the team of Vaqueros in the mid 1950s until 1982, after 15 years as a manager or manager of the team.
"This has been my best years, I have benefited most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, either as manager, manager or leader.
It has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championship matches from 1971 to 1975.
I then withdrew championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the BSN team.
From here, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, took the helm of the team, " said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a big player for you, two metres.
You want? "
This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow then advised me Raymond Gausse, who has been naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us to try to win another.
He welcomed the championship Vaqueros with Gausse, but only distance since in 1988 he was already the big brother of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his expenses and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we have won for the first time in the United States during the tournament pre-Olympic in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if the Canadian judge did not play the last game," said Reyes.
The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best national team for you?
It is one of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favourite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold, and that we have put a beating on the US team, which was quite similar to the one who had won the bronze medal at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young (Javier) "Toñito" and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to attend the World 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the tournament pre-Olympic Neuquen in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacement players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all prognoses.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, it's Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level, as did Piculín.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in the various leagues for which he has played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work of Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the OBS had up to 17 teams in a season.
What you have to do?
There are things that I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, that boys Pontius only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island.
Today, young people are travelling and playing too, even though it is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, the field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What do you do today?
In general, I listen to music, I look at my time clips on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And, of course, I would like to take the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been on my side.

Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, has been universally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, known as JR in the television series "Dallas," in which he was a businessman unscrupulous, ruthless and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, the role of oil tycoon unscrupulous J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J R in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., home production of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing ironic that he loved the most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Dallas on the holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who was performing the role of his wife in the original series and later was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and he will miss me.
"It was an exceptional person and he lived life," said Gray in a news release.
Doctors had diagnosed with liver cirrhosis Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted having a drink for many years.
In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumour in the liver and he had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas," Hagman had been known to television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of my dreams," broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he walked back home.
He has also played in two comedies that have remained little time for the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here we Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the films, there are roles well received by the critics in "the group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously evil J.R. that Larry Hagman had its greatest success.
The dramatic series of CBS on the Ewing clan and their relatives has been released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "who shot J.R.?," invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record audience at this time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers averaged in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had attracted 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. was pregnant and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people were also reasons for the attack.
Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and greedy man, but the charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who was trying to commit his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J r," said Hagman in 1988.
You should write: "Ci-gît honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only party that he has lost.
Victoria Principal, who cohosted the original series, was recalled Friday Hagman as a "great man, both on the small screen and in life."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have had the chance to know and love.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The registration of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is under construction, told the channel.
For the moment, neither Warner nor the TNT channel reported on the way will be integrated into the death of Hagman in the series.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who enjoyed fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 when she was married to counsel Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenes of theatres in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young interior designer Swedish Maj Axelsson and he has married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and has lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities.
In 2001, he has titled his memoirs "Hello: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello: the ruthless memories of J. R)
"I have nothing written in this book that can hurt or affect any way whatsoever," he said to the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active campaigner for organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help patients worried.
"I advise, I gives them confidence, I am with them when they come to do it," he said in 1996.
I am trying to offer them a bit of comfort, such as "don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a small moment, but it will go well."
He has also been campaigning against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.

A course dealing with the "end of the world" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, viruses and germs and climate change.
This semester, when the religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook: the end of the "count" of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, which refer to many people as proof of the end of the world imminent.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was expected over the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some have dubbed " the Armageddon of debt and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists thought that would trigger the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that it was going to be the most apocalyptic six months I've ever experienced," said this week Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers University, Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyse what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we racontions, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And it is not the only professor to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, the last of history.
Temple, the Assistant Professor Barry Vacker provides the "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, viruses and germs and climate change.
"We look at this because these ideas are proliferating with time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of History of Art and Anthropology, teamed to give a course, simply titled "the end of the world."
"We are adding" 2012 "to have the opportunity to give the course again, in the event that the world does not would go away," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "disaster," students must study, develop projects and spend their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not give student choice but to work "until the night of the end of the world," said Restall.
The course proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, made up of 35 students.
We have received Email several weeks before the beginning of the semester, the proportion of people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, a native of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University, Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in psychology and sickbay of 25 years, says he has watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a teacher, told us believe in the date of the end of the world of 21 December.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited," said Julie zegle, a student last year at Temple, aged 21 and a native of West Chester.
The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I admit that there is a fear about the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in such speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
It is a majority in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University La Salle, which gives courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that he was giving courses on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines are not at the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a result of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, there has been talk of the many alleged dates of the last judgement, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will begin immediately to think about the next date" or philosophize on the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning of a period of seven years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take lightly.
Many told us that they thought they were going to celebrations of the end of the world."
"Sometimes, I call friends and rigolons together," said Samira Ford, a student in communications for 20 years.
