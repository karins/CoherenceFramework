A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud.
The latter is the Brennan Center for a myth, confirmed that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republicans "lawyers have in 10 years in the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: These new rules will adversely affect voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly as a democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedure for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives seen in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require that the voters a photograph card and present proof of US citizenship.
In addition, by these laws will also shorten the time frames for the early vote annulled, the right to register as voters on election day, and nationals, denied the right to vote for a court acts.
Before the elections of 2006, no US state of the electorate, requires a photograph card appearances.
Indiana was the first federal state, which has made such a demand.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.
Over the last two years, they encouraged in 34 states bills, which voters are forced to draw a photograph card.
It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal ID card to the Health Insurance Card.
Indeed have 11% of US citizens, i.e. enfranchised 21 million people do not photograph card issued by a government authority of their state.
Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012 does not have such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary card.
Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately affected.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35.000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary photograph card.
This goes further.
The students, which are regarded as voters who cast their votes more for democratic candidates, it is not permitted in several states, to use their photograph card issued by its establishment.
On the other hand, allow the same states members of Angel-or hunting, the more for the Republican side to choose to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
In 2004, a federal state for the voters demanded proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, such a requirement.
For 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at the Hispanic votes to limit.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters, the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators have 2011 in eight states laws, which promoted the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups, to help those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections contributed to approximately 10 million citizens to register.
Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
Moreover, the Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at to shorten the period of the early vote.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida were 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance.
By contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate that voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened in order to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were partly limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the her a photograph card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly hinder the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws adopted and see them as influencing the results as a clear goal in the pivotal states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of 270 votes in the Electoral College is needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that this legislative changes to the electoral system a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: These new rules will adversely affect voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly as a democratic system of the United States.

Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: The test should be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to greater hesitation the already undecided men for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists.
In the studies in the United States were many disturbances between the onset, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the death of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that the likelihood of education in a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of metastases is 30 to 40% higher, if not carried out early detection.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, which was ill with prostate cancer.
In men afro-American origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, has been recognized as a cancer.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient, the extent of the risk of cancer actually made clear by him the possible options, which can Prostatakrebse remain untouched, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, where it has realized that no cancer treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
The proposal offers them an active surveillance and them in advance of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy the criteria for determining a decide who should be dealt with and who does not.
Therefore, I recommend the implementation of the tests.
However, the most important thing is to speak with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for Urologie Movember has developed a device with which it is possible, the pros and cons of the PSA tests to assess.
This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available shortly) can be downloaded from the following address: Http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer screening
Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise by at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, the spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain unresolved.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It damages strong people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society promote overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease.
They seem the risk of breast, Grimmdarm -, darm, esophageal, stomach speichel drüsen and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity throughout the life against Grimmdarmkrebs," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities it increased the risk of a Grimm or fattening darm cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by Räuchern, dry or salts could lead to the creation of carcinogens.
"the latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, but are not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
During a study to reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, another rather showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer was also not yet shown.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu, underlines how important it is, with his doctor to talk about his concerns and his family down.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."

The Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bosons has a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason.
It is indeed believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the bulk of all objects in the universe.
And it is the last particle whose existence by the Standard Model-our best or `least wrong "statement of nature and the behavior of the matter, but not yet been observed empirically predicted.
But it is not yet fully for physicists sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs Boson strongly resembles.
Moreover, confirmed by new data seems to be in this week in a large physics presented Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data, in order to be completely safe.
Nevertheless, we assume that it is indeed the Higgs, as seemingly little risk to deceive, and we are looking at what is at stake.
There is an inevitable in this world inescapable law, which means that two objects cannot be in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try it not too much, because you will hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that they also such a law, the Pauli Clausewitzian Ausschlussprinzip, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "Quantenzustand" and the "state" broadly consists of some of their properties.
With this in mind, physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are described as Fermione and approved the principle of Pauli.
And in the other, the Bosonen, a nasty gang of anarchists, which nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that they are indeed can pass in the same place at the same time.
This divide Bosonen The Particle Adventure, according to the website of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: The Mesonen that we are not treat and the "Kraftteilchen," spread by the large forces of nature and the Higgs Boson somehow would be used.
But it must be stressed that this Bosonen not all are so exotic creatures, as one might think.
If you are in a position to read these chronicle, it is thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The Photon or the "Lichtteilchen," the "messenger" the electromagnetic force.
If the particles with a speed up electric cargo or change the direction, the electromagnetic field on this very spot, "disrupted" as a pebble, which has been thrown into a pond.
Created by this "disturbance" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared-or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon and thus one of the Bosonen "bearer of force."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disrupted" so that this Boson shows.
However, the Higgs field much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus must reach very high energy, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be.
That is why we need a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is true that they are not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do not do so, but others - for example, a piece of paper would never think of themselves in the refrigerator.
And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those that do have a mass, while others (like the Photon) have no mass.
What all this research can now be "good," says Mrs Plamondon?
For science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists, all differences between the observations and predictions to look closely at the SM.
There are, in fact, many physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations as the slightest difference open a door to a "new physics" and could plug some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings, because there was no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, approximately 80% of the matter in the universe (ups again!).
Nevertheless, the CERN such deviations until now have not been found.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell laboratories not suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself the first permanent, laser (were the first gepulst) - said that the laser at the beginning rather was regarded as a "playing" laboratory.
Imagine...
Applications can also result from all the instruments, surrounding the research.
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the optics a small light sensor developed.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras in the world today serves as a "eye" and has won him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...

Palliative care - the best way to die... Le Devoir
With its Committee on "Dying in Dignity Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of life.
The debate must be resumed in the near future, although a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look into this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer aufzehrte, it had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years," he said half-hearted, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the previous day.
However, "it is always a shock, which is something we cannot be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: A vast weakness prevents him to go to the toilet alone and even to eat.
Sitting at the table with a delicious lunch, do it to help resignedly, making it difficult for them to eat.
He manages to smile and even courageous to speak with the stranger, which employs around him, his medicines, and offer him a bad.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest hope is that we believe diarrhea heals, because this is humiliating," he shares with.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this scourge.
"during our life, we learn that a man on foot pinkelt," Pierre told Brodeur, a psychologist in pet Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the stage of childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"That depends on the ability of the person," a step backwards, he notes.
Because according to several people who work in the palliative care, major events are in the midst of setbacks.
The patients who are trained in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
They are at this stage of the doctors and nurses, who look after them, no longer with so-called "curative care."
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, "aware and to die of suffocation."
But I have learned my children really know by the disease.
"I have good children," it adds.
"I have no wishes more to life," she says, before they accepted that it sets a mask to help her breathe.
They expected in the next few days still a last visit their son, who is from Italy.
In pet Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in the food.
The palliative care will be used, if there are no other options.
In order to make the death pleasant.
In Quebec, on top of state residents a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little bearing in mind that one day we all will die.
Here will continue life under the best conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors who.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual Komforts.
We granted the dying depending on desire a mouth with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Last night we have X served a beer, who died during the night.
This morning, his son austrinken beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," reported care director Nathalie Savard.
In the pet Victor-Gadbois is no day as the others.
As well as an old man in 93 years, the last family enjoys Rally in the courtyard and well by its head backed, while opening up in his honor, a young man dies of 36 years by his parents, his wife and two small children is surrounded, tragically, having tried everything in order to survive.
"for six months, three to five beds with cancer patients in the shares is less than 45 years of age," Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with.
53% of patients admitted to pet Victor-Gadbois come from their Wohnstätte, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care. In other words, to care, to alleviate the suffering of patients, if they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as pet Victor-Gadbois and society for domestic Palliativpflege in the Greater Montreal specialize in more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
This is the major shortcoming in the healthcare Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concern.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe signed to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system Quebec is not strong enough to ensure that all right to have a high-quality palliative care before accepting to move on euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient with severe pain, the 14 days in the emergency room was without having has taken measures to alleviate it.
I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
While several oncologists treat their patients despite worst forecasts verbissen until the last day.
The survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as they broke off an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin that I will stop the treatment, they replied that they regret that I abandons the fight, told them.
However, she had told me that I was at the end.
No omnipotente care
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nurses that it has not granted this request, after their pain by a team of palliative care have been alleviated.
It must be made clear, however, that the palliative care in the treatment of pain is not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, head of the society of domestic Palliativpflege palliative care of Montreal 8% of patients are not talking to the treatment of pain.
At the very end of life, doctors are so often on the terminale Sedierung, which amounts, the patients either sporadic or permanently einzuschläfern by the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to these terminale Sedierung.
Patients whose pain not alleviate, everyone says the same phrase: "I will die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want you to euthanise me," but "I would like to see my to alleviate pain."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalism stipendiums Canadian health research institutions.

Large-scale housing scandals in Quebec
Officials of that Bauhauptgewerbes Straßenbauamtes, Geldbeschaffer political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day, what they know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso involved.
A "industry," the Quebec was very expensive for the taxpayer, particularly in the 1990 "s and 2000" s.
"It is strange, as the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures," witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was from him a thorough study of the embezzlement in connection with the contracts to revealed Straßenbauarbeiten in Quebec, the former Prime Minister only reluctantly agreed.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he said, "the Department of Transport alone had saved $1 billion to the treaties," because some zügelten their instinct in order to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already resulted in two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it can show, "the tactics behind the individuals."
A 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit launched
Launched in 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit is doing with their troops to accountants, establish the government and analysts also great efforts.
"Marteau also the police force," which since 2009 has ensured that the Montreal "drains cartel" in the artificial inflation of the Treaties cautious...
In recent weeks it has multitudes of house searches and allegations of fraud and corruption against local elected officials as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban.
The next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city, has resigned.
He is suspected, repeatedly to have received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Explicitly accused, the Montreal Straßenbauamts, engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has sensation, the Commission by the functioning of the "system" for the maintenance of public contracts said.
He himself has several years in Montreal 3% of the value of the contracts to received an associated with the Mafia mediator paid, Montreal gave the money to the Union, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has in the 2000 "s everywhere he had his hand in by more than 88 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) province of parties, especially in power at the time gewesenen liberals.
He also acknowledged that an illegal fund-raising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau organised.
Sanitation contracts, the costs of him have been artificially inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former Bauingenieur Gilles Surprenant this before the Commission has described in detail: In ten years, he received from builders gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736.000 in exchange for sanitation contracts, which will cost it artificially.
Other officials of the Straßenbauamtes have admitted that they could schmieren by the bills with false additional services artificially by 30-40% aufblähten.
The organisers of the party has also accused the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay that he deliberately on a shadow budget has overlooked, its coffers with black filled.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which Montreal crashed into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm.
As mayor of the city bezirks Rivière-the-Prairies, in the east of the island, they are rejected from 2010 on sales of local land that bought for $5 million and 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market was sold.
70% black in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which ultimately will be carried out, "she says that it" a thread, which allows the functioning of Ameisen unterwanderten system to understand in order to stop the evil and denounce the perpetrators."
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive."
We are in the process, the wound, but would need only for Montreal certain investigation unit, and supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to make clean.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau, notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is particularly concerned about the role of "the representatives on the tactic in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
Based on a percentage of 70% black in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec witzelt it: "I was told that it was only a weak simulacrum of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, which he says would not change the situation: "As long as the campaign spending will not be strictly limited, black money circulating in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public procurement and funding of parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by the things with courage, we can go to the House on a more solid basis with more controls and rebuild laws."
If this story the Montreal Quebec and the international reputation, Mr Duchesneau urges those who laugh a look in their own backyard...

"PSG is not the Barcelona!"
In this season with PSG, you have taken on a new dimension.
How do you explain this progress?
You can by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG explain.
Great players came.
Every day I am progress on their side.
The technical staff gave me too much.
These elements encouraged me to improve my level of play on a daily basis.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football everything is very quickly.
But I breche not in enthusiasm.
Since my beginning at the heart of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine to my game time in Saint Etienne I have always made gradual progress.
They are so as to take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers are used to this summer Games very high levels.
They also know that any training unit is crucial.
The result is that a player like me who must confront and wants to give his best.
It gives me Carlo Ancelotti much in terms of my game position.
He is supported by fellow coaches as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect for all technicians.
There are currently no comparable in the Ligue 1 person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a rich experience and won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I have just recovered from a series of violation.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services.
What are your thoughts on the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of top-level reiters Lyon us.
But we lurk in the ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: We have qualified for the final 8 in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as much as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
We are, however, opposed to very good European teams have our say.
First of all, we want to be first in our group Porto so that we can fight the return leg of Achtelfinales as a home game.
The PSG can be a great European club in the short term?
He has already the budget...
In order to be a major European club, must win Paris title and make a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG the resources to enable this project is taking shape.
It would be a big failure, not winning the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really close to our hearts, cream off this title.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough for the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed with 79 points.
Normally we should be with 79 points championship...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title rings, I believe that we have the stuff on him to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4 - 0, and it still is something that we can be accused of, this is certainly something frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never every weekend with 4 - 0 win.
We are not the Barcelona.
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
In the course of time building a team.
We have shown strength in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, an association of the last two seasons fails to qualify for the final 8, and also has made huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed you break the game with 15 points ahead.
This means that our opponents and the French championship would ignored.
Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new PSG `geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems entirely by the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better that we talk of a "Zlatan dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic is strong and many goals.
That is why he and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the players and the person.
It also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, is one of the best defenders in the world, it can also all others to make progress.
How did you Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was close to my heart, to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented from some game time.
I saw things, from which I am stronger.
Today I manage to achieve good Games in the national team.
This was my hope since being launched with the `Bleus' .
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and now we must display an exemplary behavior.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the `Bleus' ?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the group qualification for the World Cup.
The coaches is strictly, the players and stimulating victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to comparison.
Blanc had achieved its objective by agreeing to qualify for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps the `Bleus' will lead to Brazil.
In Spain, on 16 October forced draw (1) a prelude game?
This game has given us confidence.

Before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.

With Bitcoin is possible without pay and selling bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange transactions identified on the basis of central banks, and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies is a political vision tangible: The belief that the current monetary system of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
This is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto (one name) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency convertible (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for the safe exchange as BitTorrent, the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network were already collected 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to $2 before he has recovered to around $10 today (prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the real world trade currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown.
Bitcoin describes as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "compete with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that will be used to move forward in a video game, win or by the Games can buy (and sometimes zurücktauschen).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade every time controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin are all network hubs at the same time, repository of the Court of auditors, monetary issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Any transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for any pay, ensuring the anonymity.
A number of related to this transaction data is electronically signed by a double Verschlüsselungssystem.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the whole network there are widespread public accounts Court Paper.
The decisive step is to sign this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task on the computers will be launched, with the winners, a kind of temporary Zentralbankier is adding the privilege to cope with these additional line.
It is a Zerstückeln the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The "taking" the new computer transaction and submit their a number, before it `zerhackt."
The aim is to find the number that a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this figure has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is linked to the chain of all other transactions in the long term, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to cheat twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money will pay, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without link, because they have different fingerprints.
The computers, the task, 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation this reward will regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins are therefore limited to 21 million in circulation, but to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, which leaves some room for maneuver...
In addition, the difficulty of the task with every improving computing power increases.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and Bitcoin assets stolen.
"the problem is not the real Minutes," Pierre Noizat insured, who has just introduced Paymium that a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin uses.
The ECB also reported on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
Cash also, however, these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia deny such donations.
By others as the WordPress blog platform will accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyzed by the Weizmann Institute in Israel the Paper and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins not circulating.
A "Mega Schlussverkauf" was launched in November.
"thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," looks forward Jon Holmquist who works for the company Coinabul the Bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin verifying the transactions, which are cheaper.
Furthermore, the owner managed its identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system can easily implemented, dealers and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
They simply need to give an address by a telephone "photographed and recognized" can be assured, Pierre Noizat, which is that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend, in the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems designed to be reviewed.
"It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
In its report, the ECB, which different today than well-respected risks in the event of a success to reassess its currency.

We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi leave).
NATO and the United States are likely to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army takes ownership of the territory again, and that the Afghan people to decide their future without all of us to expect.
In particular, we have the Afghan farmers punished, as we have seen them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our soldiers, and the injured and killed 88 Versehrten.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse to an armed foreign presence, such as the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be available when the Western countries be discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from base in Nijrab, which I witnessed by a with almond trees bepflanzten hill, which was financed by French loans, was properly.
The helicopters überflogenen trucks and armored convoys have arrived in Kabul, without being attacked.
By the end of 2014 there will be no receive more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since the irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the various inflammatory groups from the war.
Their power was seen as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
The Afghan women have the price of obscurantism of the organization Al Qaeda overpowered farmers paid to date, but their situation has not improved.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business leaders, have seized land by the government, so as to sell land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and benefit from the massive American subcontracting.
They have been discredited, and most of them were not involved in the fighting.
What I heard in the campaigns, the people want a government, which is composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as those who take advantage of American contributions could make: Capital flight is significant.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under the age of 25, Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
The state schools in the cities are full of girls as boys.
These young people who either the obscurantism the former parties still want to return to some executives corruption, it will be necessary to provide jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties are obsessed with mobile phones, with his Turkish television series, which is a modern world, everywhere.
An army is now available.
The authorities will, under whose command they will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already making efforts to restore the militias in the province, which are beyond the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities have a certain amount of decentralisation in the Western nations will benefit, but by abolishing the post of prime minister since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country since the 1950s and long before dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, there are no functioning filling stations and important irrigation system has not been repaired.
Everything is imported, apart from fruit and vegetables will produce nothing.
The private initiative is the priority.
In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the only Western countries were on the ground in order to it.
Without energy, in order to process the iron or Kupfererz on the ground, or without transport for an export on the mountains mining is impossible.
The Chinese have the copper mine of Mes Aynak already left almost, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site their dig and remain the main employer of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely depend on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Boys and girls-gymnasien, Institute for French universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sector, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which has been stopped in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carried out by a small French NGO, to try to win the "hearts and minds" and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions to achieve.
This work, required for many local labor, can help to suppress the uprising, irrigation, wells, drinking water, soil conservation, reforestation, fruit trees and farmland.
What souvenir let us back to military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions in these often amounting to more than 2,000 metres the valleys are very hard.
In the message, dozens of written questions of small projects of communities in the province of Kapisa.
So that the farmers of the insurgency led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements her desire to the continuation would be lower well-controlled and variety of civilian aid them directly in their favor.

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new President Mohamed Morsi poker game.
While Egypt in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which he granted temporary the unlimited power remains divided, more than ever, it decided to go on a map.
To the surprise of all he has on Wednesday announced that the Constituent Assembly will approve its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state this House two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt for almost two years now relies on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and a legal mess.
This new initiative is only for an even stronger divisions in the country.
For his opponents has the President in his "autocratic Delirium" by he remain "breaks his word" and "the right underfoot."
To his supporters assured that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period, forcing the brothers to renounce their plan, the Egyptians to explain the text section to section.
It is also a way for the president, his public and democratic legitimacy, during the protest is raging across the country.
After you in an interview with the US weekly Time battle Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Since the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either is her for my draft or I reserve the unlimited power," the latter should be an end to alleged after the adoption of the constitution.
85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have avoided because they believe that they have been able to bring to bear their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning 11 people in a hurry, deputy members, added.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles usually adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... in time for the prayer is expressed, as some members of the body believed that was not exactly the Pendeluhr the constituent assembly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, all the attention was, after all, is identical to that of the Constitution of 1971 and says that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The salafistischen parties for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand had hoped, "principles" should be replaced by `rules' , which would have made it possible to have a stronger application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of goodwill and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy" say the liberals who view this as a mere propaganda strike.
For them, according to the Islamisation of the Constitution has been carried out on other articles.
In particular they have in mind Article 220, Al Azhar University recognizes an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of the conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier this is worrying, because "the people who are asked to give an opinion, not elected, and no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of this theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals will also fed by the fact that the next rector of this university will be far more moderate than the current one.
"at this moment is no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text, are not keep, but academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, "Alexis Blouet appeased, a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.
He but admits that "in terms of the Article 220 can a ambiguity, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It specifically refers to the "fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence," Anm. In other Red.).
And in the future could be raised the question to what extent Zivilrichter are competent to decide."
In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday strong because of major powers, which he criticised the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: The powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget is not presented to Parliament, but a national NDC.
There will also be no ban on civil in military courts, as the associations have called for the Defense of Human Rights.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text that they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The facts of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, with serious consequences for may have the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no longer article refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
They argue that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to comment on television last night, demonstrations scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State are teeming with Saturday.

"The large and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While legislators and civil rights activist discuss what the laws on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals already with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to maintain a money at home remaining families to earn.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which each Arbeitsmigrant a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, must take.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants in the service sector, in the local housing industry and want to work in the retail sector.
However, should the tests over time according to Föderaler Migrationsbehörde compulsory for all migrant workers in the future.
We must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must both for maintaining and extending the work permit be proved.
Exceptions only for citizens of countries where Russian official language.
Also excluded from this law are people who their education certificates and diplomas received before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Point problem and protecting the rights
The whole of examination under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian people's hospitality, the Moscow State University, University of St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all the cities; in Russia have already been already opened centres more than 160.
The initiative was the introduction of the tests by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migrationsbehörde support.
Human rights activists, on the other hand, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press the following question: What is it really?
What changes, the provision, language skills to deliver, both for the Russians and for guest workers?
Above all, say the Migrationsbehörde spokesman, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labor.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migrationsbehörde representation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
But their rights must be protected before departure.
Only an organised recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without working, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably face people with bad intentions, which it under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow cabin, where he stay with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day will collapse.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"at home will promise you one thing, and cheated on arrival you will get their passports and do not receive the promised pay," the head of the Headquarters confirmed for migration of Tajik Migrationsbehörde, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not whose chief.
Nevertheless, many people give the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money that they not only do not speak the language of the destination country, but also in their own language hardly able to express in writing.
Of course, this is not their fault, so much as the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a sound basic education.
Because there are not even in their families money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and Schulsachen.
As a teenager these children to take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they are.
"you fühlst humiliated and degraded."
Human rights activists stress on the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
"welcome" or "Entry prohibited for unauthorised persons '
Many migrants in Russia, confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status.
The reason, bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents largely fake and we are not registered, and then result cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,", the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"spare no expense for false papers '
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates, which are educated the language tests certify, have already been of members of the Federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.
The fraudulent papers were printed with an ordinary Farbdrucker.
Of course, the new owners this is true: Every migrant, hoped to be able to save as the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and human rights activists agree.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers who fall through the test for the first time, only promise that they receive time for a language rate.
In addition, newcomers without language skills, offered jobs in areas where there is no active necessary understanding with people.

Interior ignored illegal arms market
Share legal weapons to very low crime
The Russian Ministry is planning a tightening of the arms law for private gun owners.
The authorities in response to recent events: Injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the run of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police will ban the wearing not lethal weapons in the public and the age for the possession of firearms increase from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes to the Arms Act will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities to combat the problems caused by "attraction of the screws".
On the Internet was published an open letter, whose author. - representatives of various weapons organizations by the authorities, to refrain from "senseless improvements".
The percentage of crimes registered with weapons is very low, said the Strafrechtler Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior with use of registered weapons were 142 crimes committed in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total 168 thousand offences were recorded.
The authors of the open Briefs are convinced that tightening up the law on private gun owners will not deter criminals on the black market.
For the time being, according to the authors, in Moscow, it can find every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry stressed that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From the factories to the officers
The weapons through several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, told a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot adopts a website, weapons orders
The first channel, the army or the military, i.e.. Weapons were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were both by the Russian officers and the stolen," says Baranez Kaukasiern itself.
At the second channel clandestine weapons, the vigilante are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that these weapons, which both the police and directly from the armouries of law enforcement personnel were stolen.
Further illegally sold weapons come from military camps.
In many military camps, often explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases was arson, in order to conceal the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Contribute to the black market in accordance with Baranez the arms manufacturers.
"today there are countless private arms factories that the international competition and therefore not withstand the weapons on the black market, such as by Moscow, dump," reported the expert.
Another channel black market is smuggling.
Too many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"there is a separate, sometimes small-scale production and a mafia, which organised the smuggling," explained the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated how much each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal arms around.
In 2011, a report by the Center for the Study of problem analysis and government.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for state statistics, forensic literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the issue of arms.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators by the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market by the "are to blame for leaders who come in to do their work with weapons," the report states.
According to the data of researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are due to theft in the production of weapons, and 5% come from illegal dig.
An adviser of arms sales ladens, who do not want to be named, assured that weapons in illegal dig be found, no one buys more, because they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more likely that retailers the supply in an arms depot.
On a Fähnrich is a weapon, for example, such as the TT, bought a gun.
The weapon will be issued and handed over to the fence.
"The dealers the weapon in the city and selling them for $900 per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know about everything and, therefore, of course, if they fail to comply with the plan to uncover crimes can, periodic Kontrollkäufe dealers by offering illegal arms," adds the sale advisers.
"How in luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find most about acquaintances each other.
I had seen websites and blogs, as someone who was closely on me and I proposed to station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me, which I would, in a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price of the weapon I learned only there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"in order to obtain a weapon, I need an acquaintance, contacts," told the sale advisers. "I have a friend, but I do not trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but they must go and keep a close eye on the code of action as "Ivan Iwanowitsch, the host that the daughter has lost a tooth."
Indeed, I come to some key rings on a friend, whom I trust.
It gives me the rings also only because he knows that I not verpfeife him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways.
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried as buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990 "s, when he wrote an article on this issue.
The scheme have not changed according to him.
He was a photo album, was reflected in the "everything."
"I felt like in luxury," remembers the military personnel.
The buyer gets according Baranez not a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
I buy not just as a potential customer, but ride with the seller in the forest, where we are a target.
"I can shoot, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," describes the expert's approach.
Buy from the armchair
Internetsuchmaschinen show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontakte," where arms offered "for a variety of purposes."
It does not need any papers there are still personal meeting.
"You only need the right amount of money," it is said in the statement of advertising on the website "buy fight gun or rifle."
There users your orders and ask questions.
Will also sold to minors?
"Of course without a licence," asks users "Ivan" (direct quote).
"buy a TT. Moscow," says the lakonische question of "Fedorenkow."
The Federal Security Service, recently countless Scheinwebseiten, and buyers who want to buy arms, the service full on the web.
The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and then end up in Siberia and coal digging
Military commentator and former soldiers Viktor Baranez
I have heard on the following scheme: The website is registered abroad and Russian laws are not normally applied.
The leaders are the orders.
The buyer transfers the money on a bank machines.
"in response it receives a photograph and a description of the Verstecks the weapon," reported the charitable organization "Pravo na oryzhie' press secretary Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stressed that in the final analysis, destitute and can be behind bars if you put a question on a website.
The Federal Security Service, recently countless Scheinwebseiten, and buyers who want to buy arms, the service full on the web.
"The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and then end up in Siberian labor camps and digging coal," he says.
A Makarov for $100
Buying illegal firearms, according to the experts, with prices of $100 and 900.
According to the organization `Pravo na Dmitry Kislow oryzhie "can be a type Makarov pistol for $100 to 300 buy.
We must wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military arsenals of overseers middle class.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences with illegal arms throughout Russia during the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22 9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices by 7.8% shrank.

In the US fast-food and supermarket workers on strike
One in four American young people sitting behind the coffers of Mc Donald's
In recent days there has been across the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests will continue to grow or whether they will soon be back to the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-leaning non-governmental organizations.
In addition to improving the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, the sales in the United States, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes led to Handgemengen.
On this day, some Walmart workers, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and bestreikten along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, are aimed at low and middle-income people.
Walmart sold all products, ranging from nappies of hunting rifles and car batteries to dust saugern, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore buy many of the slightly paid Walmart work only on their jobs.
Prices and the range of goods, Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say the goods often Walmart can only sell so cheaply because the staff are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about hard work conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner.
The participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanding wage increases, and expressed their irritation that the contribution to the betriebseigene health insurance has risen from 30% to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart workers who earns $9.5 per hour, cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California Berkeley show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost 3.2 billion dollars Walmart.
The equivalent of 1.1% more than they now pay for donations.
Walmart would pass on the full wage increases to their customers, each purchase only 46 cents more in the future.
Per year would be the for them compared with the current expenditure of only 12 39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine states to protests and that the company gave no losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and Walmart sold in this period some 5,000 Article per second.
Overall, the Walmart cash on "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart workers working niederlegten and the protest action only "another PR stunt" was the union that organised the protests,.
"free money!"
The protests this week in New York, where their goal but not Walmart stores (which in this progressive city unwanted and therefore are not so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants were.
McDonald's says the company sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted you no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollars an hour.
In fast-food restaurants will gradually increase the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8 $90 per hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to live in New York with so little money is beyond me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's was behind the Theke, but young people were living with their parents.
Hardly anyone was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with staff of McDonald's constantly people who complain that they live with this wage and sometimes have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal, the author points out, it would be irresponsible to have children if it did not know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants received a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which represents more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They further demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law does not permit this objective to stand in the way of corporate governance and trade unionists abzumahnen or released.
On the other hand, they cannot simply corporate governance.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but also for objective reasons difficult.
The main reason is the high turnover.
Unhappy
Vocal protests on this day, there were many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The height of the protests was an assembly at midday before the McDonald's on Times Square, where some local Democrats languages, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted you no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food staff together so that they paid a fair and economic prosperity can achieve that every New York deserves."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest project of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
But only a few hundred people on the ground, were far from all of them in the fast-food industry employed in the tens of thousands of work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole mass.

"The brain is so far only moderately outsmart"
The purveyors of the enlarged becomes a reality in supporters of modern technologies recently usually seen through the lens of a special glasses.
First, Google in the summer, a working model at its annual conference in November was then known that Microsoft had a similar patents.
In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the lens for the company's scientists was only a transit station.
It fascinates the possibility, virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and to create virtual belts.
- please Beschreiben briefly, what research group.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the borders of this interaction.
So far, humanity is largely stuck in the stage, where the Pixeln on Flachbildschirmen, which sometimes.
We want 5-10 years vorausblicken and the radical changes this interaction foresee.
, for example, the Xbox-Konsole and the Kinect sensors a step forward, and today will no longer without Xbox Kinect sold, as all interested in movement control.
- What are still expected in the future?
- Although Kinect interaction on a physical level, has a great deal to the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D.
The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We are trying to change that are working on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We need to the computer world in our physical world and make them more tangible.
Yet it is necessary that not only the users, but also its surroundings.
Then we could supplement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should be rid of this bescheuerten virtual reality helmets.
- What do you think about language management?
It is popular, but it will not overvalued?
- you is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because it does not always would like to inform all others on his actions and intentions.
Any kind of interaction with computers is really good, but each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of management of objects in public places in a project in which we experimenting with short and narrow, rather than sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not from the object camera, recorded, but by a bracelet registered the movements of the bone and muscle.
It is still relatively large, but could in theory to the size of a wristwatch be reduced.
But the future belongs to all types of mixed governance, for example, Gestik and language.
- As the?
- We would you ask me, for example, you this Sprudel dose to extend?
They say it and, at the same time.
- normally I say it simply.
- O, that would be very difficult to see.
- saying that you want the user will adapt to the, which can make a machine at the time and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the next time we especially need to work on the development of new types of sensor, which will make it possible to collect responses from people.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good dissolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands you on the basis of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
There is a lack of dissolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 Megapixel at a speed of 1000 fps not bad.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
In this respect, all current technologies not good enough for us, as the designer of the algorithms more work.
It is not only the break-up along the X and Y-but also take into account along the Z axis.
Also the speed and the number of images per second are important.
The movements of people are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps, particularly for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with a regulierbaren processing delay between 1 and 100 Millisekunden, with today's commercial carriers closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much influenced the interaction of man and machine.
Just as an instrument for my work I needed, only without contact management and with more images per second.
- should not be increased the number of cameras first?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras," with one of them actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not intended to calculate the object deep.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or, as more calculations needed to strengthen the problem.
Would be nice a flexible, Kinect-similar system in which we could play with various camera slopes, in order to determine how we help the three-dimensional investigation a position.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft his glasses not public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged everyday reality in the lens has the best prospects?
- Of course it is not nice, always a Smartphone en route to keep in the hand, but I think the following: The tollste variant would be a "rotating" enlarged reality in which we have a cloud of the lens could tune in to the Smartphone,
The lens is a personal Gadget and that is its strength (private you can only see), but also its weakness, as it is an enlarged reality through the lens prevents you can work together with other virtual objects.
- Let us for a moment that the virtual Hologramme manipulation in the air not only Tony Stark is accessible from Iron Man, but also human beings.
There is a problem, to underline the Critics frequently this idea: There is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing!
The answers to your group at this point?
- In my lectures, I often talk that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of taktilen perception.
An interesting method is the use of second hand as something unusual projection document.
It takes pressure excellent true!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at the "images in the air a hand" to give firm, for example, the collision of ultrasound directed some rays in a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently still so weak, as pustete ballen someone on hand.
There are also bands for the hand Accident, affecting the nervous endungen in the fingers, it is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
I think that it should feel what it felt when it sees something?
- This is a good idea, as we have not yet tried.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, namely a man who is physically in a closed area, to believe that he was instead in an open, virtually infinite space, where we have been working on concepts with Laufbändern (other than in fitness studios), movable platforms and large bullets.
So far the brain can only moderate fall, and we still have many years of hard work.
It is precisely that which makes work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers appeal: On many issues we are only at the start.

Their own taste rather than cultural rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburg vanguard" project, the city dwellers, which form the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the select list, already high-ranking Petersburg art scene, whose achievements and often go beyond the city's borders, without recognition in Europe to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the "artists Kirill Miller.
The entire city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded, dressed in red in a Russian museum, sometimes at the summer, sometimes in scene-meeting or Vernissagen.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also be issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of Petersburg vanguard in the late 80s and early 90s.
It is also a man of the city and confirmed by his presence on the streets smiles in the face and his fellow citizens is causing them for good humor.
He recently, at a Drehorgel and became the Petersburg Drehorgel players, as it is for these difficult role in terms of artists dasein, his philosophy and his image was adrift.
- Kirill, why you are always in red and not, for example, in yellow or Türkis in the city?
I have chosen the color red as fashion designers, which deals with the optics and image.
In this world is red the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In the society calls on everything, something from the gray standard, aggression and bad behavior.
But let me by my provocations to meet with the people.
All my last provocation was an invitation to talks.
- When wusstest you that you must be painter?
- In an exhibition in the culture palace Newskij, and my work were issued.
I realized that I must go this way.
That was the period of old free, but not officially recognized painter to end, and then new and free painters as I was incomprehensible.
I friendly with the new generation of painters, with representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; hence, "Puschkinskaja 10," and then was first conclusion.
Me prefers the theater, fashion, music, everything except in literature.
- And all the united in your kind-hospital... - It was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied an area in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical, artistic club to the renovation of the Boheme, the House of Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born: N.O.M. Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" there.
String and his friends sang simple songs to play-back close jersey and contributed to them was the today mature composer Igor Wdowin.
As the group began to play live, it was "Leningrad."
Costumes mountain facilitated many programs before the time of `Halli Galli."
We gave them costumes mountain, and it started his great career, but the foundations he learned.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club `Griboedov "have their origin in the clinic.
There were our staff and stem passengers.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, there have been in the press, a survey on the award "figures of our city."
I won in the category of "artist of the Year Award, and I was at the height.
It is not easy to work in new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You may be famous, without a cultural contribution.
- your work has a distinctive style.
- Many my images are real pearls and express clearly the timeliness and ferocity of the idea.
I am an exhibition with the theme of "The Russian museum as clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was socially, but now it pains and fear that to be the case.
In a clown blur all this and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world by making that everyone has to dress up fully.
Now respects everyone on the clothes and the Outer and not focused on the inside of the people.
But perhaps we cannot provide a person, but he should face spucken.
The illusion disappear by the dress up.
- Before recently we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgel player. - A City of Culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can be commercial art nice?
- It must be careful, respectful and complimentary commercial art.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Earlier formed the human large groups: The Bohemiens loved one and the other the ordinary people.
Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please all.
I am not 100 dollar note that everyone likes.
Will you consider who have now fallen.
Now, every cult star around 100 supporters.
- On the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand.
- At him, abandoned women, there is a role for the sexually-social sphere.
300 people come for cultural reasons and not 10 thousand, so there are fewer management, money, and anything goes.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has already been achieved.
In my youth I have such pictures painted in a gathering with the works of Falk and even in a series Larionow.
I began with images, which normally only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It reads: Intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption does not have a culture that is quite another.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture, which I support.
- Kirill, what is lacking Petersburg?
- the best culture experts.
Saying that servant of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real czar the tsars may not be understood it was different, because a lot of culture, but it is understood that right experts necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good adviser.
In St. Petersburg, we have those who could be experts, but the road has been closed, as it requires hochrangigerer experts, the former properly evaluate and open the path for them.
Now only their own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters to find other museums.
- What is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow, there is far more culture and breeding ground.
On our stones art find it difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural fertile ground for example we now have more writers and readers, and this is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
For us, these are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded through grants the city of St. Petersburg

Born in outer space
World at risk.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
Karawanen of space ships with Erdbewohnern on board are on the search for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important issue is how we in the bubbles or spare planet can breed?
There are many choices I do not think so.
De facto, there are only two real planet that we could at least hypothetical inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomical star mountain Institute Vladimir Surdin.
But while the conditions on Mars are comparatively lebensfreundlich, there is a Venus on the surface temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only in height or Venus in orbit, in space, possible.
The researchers first dealt with the issue of reproduction in space in terms of the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments were carried out with plant.
The fourth generation of peas, not at all was produced in the orbit of the irdischen species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, tiny fruit flies in detail (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 Wachteleier were sent out into space, we want to see how the bubbles on the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chicks.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chicks must be stopped; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explained the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew.
Without firm underground überschlugen the chicks wild.
Ten hours later stumpften fully the instincts of the babies.
The chicks not responded to light and Laute.
They then simply died four days later.
"twice we chicks and slip it, simply because it is impossible to work with them," there is Vladimir Sychew for a failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
But will be based on the Biosatelliten "Bion" only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that are already fertilized were sent into space.
In principle it was nothing special.
"That was just with the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only one experiment, and research needs to be continued," said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the space rats were young.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could have not been resolved.
The task is difficult.
Animals, snatched from their natural habitats, simply cannot follow their Fortpflanzungstrieb.
Unlike animals could man the in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstraktem thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
Such experiments on ethical considerations are not carried out.
But women already fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk, Tereshkova.
The Wertvollste that mankind is the female body.
Our Möwe flew and nobody in the world can answer the following question: Would it preserves the space flight?
Will they can bring a child into the world after this flight?
"after all, nobody answered this question," says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after its space flight, gave the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988 brought forth the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which was twice in orbit and even doing work outside the space vehicle, a son.
Nevertheless, it remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet must humanity for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the produce artificial Gravitation.
The cosmonaut's Hydrolabor in preparation center is a compulsory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for work in the open space.
Water is the bubbles.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is an alien environment, but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testify of that life in the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child, approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit is water, and that it can easily become accustomed to water.
In principle, the logical, as the cradle for the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget," says something Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
So while the bubbles for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of bubbles, the stomach and basin muskulatur is very quickly and it is also the ability to extract the baby.
Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could, for example, in a Spezialkammer in order to extract the baby.
"But what happens?" is the important issue of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand the child needs also artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung to feel the skeleton and muscles, the organism cannot train.
A newborn child cannot as an adult in the orbit to training in a burden to be invested.
It is simply the lack, which is vital for his life.
"this experiment, which we make together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will lead to a disabled person, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world," says the head of the Institute for medical and biological Bioethikkommission problems ran, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in outer space just theory.
At some point, but they reality, if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space.

NKÚ C hef: Control of the black system failed as a result of the policy
The Czech Republic holds good bodies in connection with public contracts and adequate laws, however, is back in its application.
In talks for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied properly - and I think that this is not the case with us," commented on Kala the current situation.
Come to a similar conclusion seems to be a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practice for it leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas the so-called "black system."
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not trouble the entrepreneurs with controls - the system is now prohibited or permitted?
"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, the government cannot simply chairman, and the one whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work," Kala.
At the meeting of the committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other.
What was there in concrete terms?
It is a parallel examination, with which we began about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question that the European legislators are to decide how to handle public contracts. Count on the national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the review has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences. Generally speaking, laws are perhaps a little "strict and perfect," but the real application is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. We must also address the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? What is for you from this project?
Just such a common control could help that we stop at a constantly perfecting of laws and cutting and balancing of thresholds, if this obviously not very positive effects.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
It may even be that we in this way the system only with excessive "red tape" and those seeking loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the thresholds were higher.
They are talking about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the system work in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
With regard to the authorities, the German counterpart to the General Accounting Office, NKÚ built along the same lines as at home and also has a college that only slightly different. But both authorities are similar in principle.
Also the skills are comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, that is, that the courts in the individual Länder - and this is where the German system differs from our.
The BRH may only federal funding control what our public funds.
Public funds, which is administered by the districts and communities, with us. There are subject to the control of the Courts
What the German legislation, which is easier than our?
I would generally without specifics are reluctant to compare. Nevertheless, Germany in some ways, often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
This is perhaps because the auditors are better?
Surely not, but as I have said, I may not particularly like to such comparisons.
This is still, it should be noted that even a model for those countries which are also struggling.
Otherwise they would have nothing to work with our authority, isn't it?
What the Czech legislation, had for the revision of the law on procurement, you feel your authority have any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in power, it is in our tests have not yet.
Since our controls after, we must take place here with some delay.
Impact we feel so far more in the preparation of future controls - as we have the new control "detection of risks of inefficiency" and introduced with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analyzed, the changes will change of course, because the thresholds, the conditions for certain types of contracts were among the modified.
You see the passage of this bill rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption confirmed.
However, there is the difficulty that the rules are "strict" and cannot be met.
Under the previous rules are a test unterzogenen people to the winner (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, accountable to the regional council) that any breach of public procurement law is tantamount to violation of budgetary discipline.
It makes sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not believe in this way.
The system have to exclude those who want to attack and abusing the system and not penalize those who have made a formal errors, which affects the real decision-making not.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.
Where is the solution?
We say first of all, what is not successful.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS employers with controls of the so-called "black" system would lay-exactly what does that mean?
The black and system is now prohibited or permitted?
A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, the government cannot simply chairman, and the one whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work.
He can say: `We change the law and allow the matter, "but he cannot say that we are, as if nothing had happened.
The allocation law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and that is right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic if the bidders with the best offer alone because of procedural irregularities.
The law will never be perfect, but it needs to be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing.

On the streets, occasionally Eisglätte, mostly, however, they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic consists partly snow and Eisglätte.
However, most of the roads are good line, sometimes is increased caution.
Karlsbad
In the Karlsbad line the streets this morning were well, occasionally there was snow and Eisglätte.
Temperatures fell to 5 to 1 0 ° C, it should be slightly warmer during the day.
In the region it is snowing now no longer, and in the underlying high altitudes remains only a thin snow cover.
On the Erzgebirges Kämmen but about 30 cm of snow.
According to the Bezirksstraßenwacht was due to fog restrictive view.
The highway R6 and the road transport routes the first class in the region are currently fully line.
Attention is offered on bridges, for example, on which the lanes are sometimes frozen and smooth.
Line are also all the second and third road class roads, including the mountain roads.
On these roads, however, remain in phases vereiste or ausgefahrene snow piling up.
Especially in the higher areas therefore increased attention is needed.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads Ostböhmens is risk because Eisglätte in higher positions on the streets and in the mountains is sometimes even a ausgefahrene snow layer, the Directorate road and motorway shares on their websites.
The Straßenmeistereien drivers warn Eisglätte, especially in higher positions in the Pardubice may occur.
To Eisglätte can, in particular on the second and third road transport routes class in the counties of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The streets I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow, particularly on the roads in the Giant mountains and the Orlické Hory.
A ausgefahrene snow layer lies in high altitudes on the streets of circles Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
Today in Ostböhmen mostly sunny and pleasant, and it remains largely niederschlagsfrei.
Temperatures are between 3 and +1 ° C, it is a weak wind.
District Pilsen
The streets in the Pilsen are well suitable, locally, however, increased attention is needed, and the way is to adapt to the weather.
This is in the morning chill, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
As it has previously snowed and temperatures then fell, it can Eisglätte on the roads.
Local is also with fog, with the view, will improve in the next cycle.
These figures come from the district straßenmeistereien.
The D5 motorway is virtually fully recommend Straßenmeistereien line, increased attention, however, between 80th and 131. Kilometres.
The lanes of the first road class are mostly dry, but durchgefroren.
In the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov, however, it can reach Eisglätte phases.
The second and third road lanes class is wet, and therefore also applies here the reference to possible vereiste sections.
Drivers mainly on the less commuter roads in the area should be particularly careful Böhmerwald.
District Olomouc
With snow matsch drivers, which must now towards the high altitudes in the Olomouc.
After the use of cluster vehicles, snow matsch remains on the passport Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.

In other areas of the province, the lanes are often full line.
"in the circle Šumperk remain at high altitudes snow piling up yet.
On the passport Červenohorské sedlo drivers must count towards matsch Jeseník with snow, "said a member of the Road Administration Šumperk today to the Agency ČTK.
Also had to their colleagues in the county of Jeseník during the night, according to their claims, the road to the high altitudes after chemical treatment free and wet.

Šimon Ornest: Do we want to collect positive energy on our concerts
What do you think that is due to take place in less than a month of doom?
This is one of those disasters reports, we the people so much like to start up again.
With our band The TAP TAP let us more poked fun at and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to halt the doomsday or prevent.
In December realize you also a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.
Can you imagine our readers the project?
It is a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung plan that we have two years.
To this end, we want to use the Marketingpotenzial of the Mayan calendar, the end is forecast at 11:10 a.m. on 21 December.
The day before, on 20 December, from 21:00 a.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of the Maya calendar ends.
Where this idea come from?
Originally come from me, then we have the idea together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta.
In this connection, we would not enough positive energy, in order to prevent the doomsday, together with the public, but we also want to consider in the state we give our children the world.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have a unique range of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key supporters against the doomsday developed, with their purchase on www.e - tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The TAP TAP, together with other performers also known as the anthem against the doomsday entitled "doomsday is included."
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will ring out on the Benefizkonzerten?
Of course, at the end, provided that all work and not the doomsday...
The national anthem should be sung by all actors at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns together in a Direktschaltung by Czech television broadcast.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, which also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How can you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other figures of the Czech culture scene, that implies that we achieve many Benefizveranstaltungen and concerts...
We are trying to these people involved in our projects.
It was clear that are most interested in cooperating with us, and have fun in it.
What purpose will be of great benefit to the proceeds of concerts against the doomsday?
For the establishment of the barrier free education center Studeo, on which we are already six years working together with the club TAP in Jedlička Institute.
The pupils the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by teachers who help them in various leisure activities.
Since the students do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute to create a separate buildings in which we then with this project.
In every concert, several groups and performers.
According to what criteria you have chosen this?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You know everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "events" are also planned for the future?
We are in May for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert with interesting guests we are preparing a interesting program.
Next year we would also like to arise in the Czech house in New York, and I personally, if we are already in the United States, this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans are not just small, you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
However, the TAP TAP is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with this travel logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the baggage area. We must also, of course, many instruments koffer and other baggage mitschleppen...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes even surprised me.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility as they deal with disabled people, etc..
How have you seen these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we are witnessing the in Russia that were in the east is still in its infancy.
In Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. It is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair is traveling alone in the city center.
It is not even, of course, that there is a person in a wheelchair lift vorlässt, for example.
Fortunately, there will also be created clubs who are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things, where we are...
To say that there is an improvement in the situation also always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal for people with severe disabilities too independently in the public sphere, go into the museum, can use toilets, etc..
But it is not normal for a larger group of disabled people, and we are actively involved in social life with the band The TAP TAP slightly ahead of the West.
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when important from our ranks athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers, things will start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken personalities.
The TAP TAP is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What did you in 1998, motivated to start a band?
Then I began as carers in Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something hard.
And since I myself am musicians including. Saxofon games, I have established a music company, along with a colleague.
Na, and, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs).
The band was known but only in recent years, or I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known Sängern helped us; we have also started to campaign actively for us.
We realized that if something, and this is not outwardly, their own performance in a sense does not exist.
Thanks to the EU aid we can also good teachers, high-quality equipment, etc...
It is your goal, but with The TAP TAP so far?
From the outset, I felt the potential that can things in a different way.
In Showbusiness today often copied the other.
In its own way, it is only logical as anything new viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that TAP TAP is one of them.
The first impression of the spectators usually has, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned nature, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities do something, this is not just a step forward for themselves, but for the whole of society.
It was also helpful for this success that you are a strong leader, as you can tell by many people?
If you want to make something good, you cannot compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline.
But I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come with romantic ideas, and if they discover that they have test twice a week, must overcome stages of preparation and spend a lot of time travel on concert, then the enthusiasm among many quickly extinguished.
But the way things work everywhere, in every band, the serious work and wants something.
At present, The TAP TAP twenty members.
How many of them were from the outset, since 1998.
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. You cannot prevent.
Who has the will and the desire to do, we always welcome.
Will take place the day before the doomsday, predicted Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech band and other musicians
All three venues will finally by Live which connected and it erklingt a common interpretation of the anthem "doomsday" from the band The TAP TAP.
Aim of the Konzertes is, the funds for the installation of a multifunctional disabled education center to that under the name STUDEO in Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK.
The entry costs 400 CZK, children until 12 years free of charge, cards are available in Vorverkauf Bohemiaticket.

Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency ESA as the twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member country from the former communist bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA Member).
Poland began in 1994 close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects.
The path Poland into space but began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space, but they do not always were met with understanding.
I recall, for example, of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, where the author ideas from his pioneering "entrance to Kosmonautik" presented.
The ideas of the young engineer (conduct. However, 1905), the audience cold, and after years remembered Šternfeld still that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in the year in 1934 for "receipt to Kosmonautik' the donated by Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix REP-Hirsch.
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis internationally recognized contribution to the development of space, inter alia, acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon has been named after him.
As early as the year 1925 a rail Draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket powered was planned.
The author of the proposal and the details of this project, remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile for Starten or brakes the Draisine should be used.
The information derived only from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with raketenbetriebenen munitions.
The research led the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents provided that research has got to the stage of practical tests.
But the research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German military power.
In 1937 appeared in the press of mine. Draft originating Rohoziński fotoelektrischen hunting rocket, and the following year, the work "Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of missiles antriebs.
Shortly before the war were all projects for military use of missile technology by the artist scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet coordinated Doradczo Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of hard work, however, the war began his work was closed.
Other articles appeared to space after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention this society is in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which four dedicated extensive article of the space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space society.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future space exploration.
Already in its inception in 1956, the Polish space society PTA to join the International Federation for space, founded in 1951 and the PTA was actually due as early as the autumn 1956 member.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.
This office he had until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA instrumental in the development of the very successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM 1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres long and weighed approximately 80 cm was not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM, 1A, built in 1959, and began in the Błędów desert air tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM - 2
The missile was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be in a position to make real scientific work - the missile RM - 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the monitoring of high winds.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
Heir to the first rockets of the type RM was the 1962 to 1965 developed over the years Meteor 1 rocket.
The missile was conceived as a Zweistufenrakete, their total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
By this missile were developed three types (Meteor 1A, 1B - and 1 C) that in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor - 1A missile had a transport area with 0.4 litres capacity, meteor - 1B more than 34 litre and Meteor 1C on 0.62 litre.
The maximum altitude for all three types 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 was in the aviation institute the Meteor 2 missile, developed the first test flights began in October 1970.
Meteor - 2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able, specifically a of 10 kg in a level of approximately 60 km.
Then the versions were built meteor - 2H and Meteor - 3.
Is also noteworthy Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, the two years later was followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland also participated in the framework of the Interkosmos program with Soviet satellite in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski second after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut.

The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court on voluntary work on the law.
This decision, a lively debate in public.
It is interesting, to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions.
Under this concept is a state is trying to understand where the manufacturers to compete with imports cheaper goods in the economic, making the competition "unterbietet," thereby grab a larger share of the market and to increase its profit.
On a large scale does this mean for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or to abandon their business. The result is a comparable high unemployment in countries with high labor costs.
As the capital no social responsibility and, therefore, bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, necessarily increase public spending.
This situation is made even worse by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and by the overall economic and social damage caused by them to replace.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are not at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to reduce the social artificially level of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words: Governments provide its own people without regard to the social consequences from the private sector.
This is reflected in amendments to existing laws.
Objective of these measures is to force its own people, particularly in the field of pay to accept the dictates of private capital.
This is partly by financial constraints in long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by limiting the workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, and widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who are no longer able to feed through their own work.
The number of people are already in the millions.
In the wake of the increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it regularly to cases in which workers are paid so little that the state must increase their income until the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures virtually all EU southern will undoubtedly come to exactly the same situation, in which the people under pressure from a disastrous crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or for a pittance to languish on the fringes of society and hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
The natural question that arises here is where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, is only the poverty from one country to another, or the capital remains altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages.
This is all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state cannot capital involved in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
The private, parochial, insists on its position that the state cannot intervene lenkend in the economy.
But we must ask whether the capital's policy and thus affect the entire state in their own selfish sense or even.
This is a clear answer: Yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation in the fight against corruption, mutual advantage, a legislation, in the criminal virtually everything, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the reality is that a State Department due to lack of finances private, with the industry verflochtene legal companies charged with drawing up draft law.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence will no longer from the people, as the Western constitutions, but powerful financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
Obviously liberal democracies are currently quickly in a situation like they Appian in his work on the crisis at the time of the Roman Republic Caesar and Pompeius `describes: "The government was that has long been the disintegration and the offices have been filled with violence.
Against bribes by unlawful or fraudulent use of benefits with Stein and sword.
The corruption has grown incontinent, and the people have already bought votes on election, people with "..." character bewarben not for offices, so that the state had "no consul for eight months due to this decline..." You really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine is a dictatorship in this difficult situation, and that a strong man should be chosen "... Appian is thought to Pompeius, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, which democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, is based in today's society, as in antiquity the reckless preference of their own advantage, without paying attention to societal interests.
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who do not in any way seek deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism we must therefore in the reckless economic liberalisation systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current condition, the demise of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, already in the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the social and humanitarian disasters, we are already witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and contemporary history, in complete ignorance of.
The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systembedingt.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that the capital increase the state involvement in the economy, increase the influence of citizens to the government and the monopoly of private capital in society in the country.

Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
... "nothing from violence, or ever could arise" sings Sting in song Fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons wanted no wars, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions.
The one behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel as terrorist.
At this point, I would not write about who in these recurring waves of killing guilty and who is victims; eventually, today's residents of Israel including the self-rule areas were born into the current political situation and have not even seen the beginning of violence.
What is important is to open the readers to look behind the scenes, the mind, whom the 95 years tension (expected from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spots are conducive to country in the Middle East in particular.
My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding of who or which group of people significant impact on the events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can represent a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these figures, the autonomous certain in their actions, or whether someone stand behind their throne, their actions drew on a vorbestimmtes target.
We must admit that we live in a time where the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power not within the life span of a generation.
Under these astronomical is a particularly rich families, which could be described as head of the zone (I do not know whether anyone else is above them, I do not exclude this but) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written on them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already in the 1990s by the Rothschilds bought in the 19th century, in order to prevent the link its name with hochkriminellen deeds, in whose background is to consolidate their power, to increase their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they wars or equip itself in this (before the attack on Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government suggested).
Whoever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused, the status of Rothschilds Bank of America to renew the central bank began during the civil war to produce its own (read: State) notes and was assassinated in a theater 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to produce its own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis Mc Fadden he was poisoned in 1936 after the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929 wanted to sue.
The Rothschilds led the global appetite in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to unleashing of three World Wars by Albert Pik, a Freemasons of the 33rd and highest degree of insight.
The first war was aimed to eliminate the large monarchistischen countries of Europe by the second war in particular, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is the world's population on about 0.5, 1 billion people (such a number would for their comforts and reduce their consumption of luxury and would also not so many resources), create a Universalreligion (The Ökumenismus is nothing more than the run-up to) and finally lead to the absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds is working at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order Chao order from the chaos).
But these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the Fed to prevent crises like the not repeat them in 1907).
Having them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed, the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar empire was the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European imperial Austria, Hungary.
In order to be able to make easier the Second World War, the bankers by the policies they create a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic war reparationen showed; they created the condition impoverished masses, so that they only a sufficiently strong driving the Germans had to unterjubeln named the culprits and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the Vielvölkerstaates Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who should play the role of a fifth column and also took to the war brand.
At the end of the nineteenth century the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement of a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as in the historic area Judäas with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was first established clashes with the Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler of the chain losriss, in which the international bankers initially believed, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the war reparationen against Germany prepares the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the state of Israel was the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, like the Jewish people during World War II victim in the front line, this time with the Arab or Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how strongly people in Israel's supporters and opponents).
Who is the culprit, who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where wrong only wrong in an endless spiral of violence, and at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
We must distinguish between the people of Israel and its leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only its own candidate for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, international bankers loyal ergebenen politician, who is doing everything possible to ensure to start a war with Iran, which in view of Iran's membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for Cooperation (...), China, India, Russia, Pakistan could rapidly degenerate into a global conflict and where it because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, to destroy the world economy.
In the light as the words David Rockefellers in 1994: "The only thing we need is an over-arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In a world of their idea is the new world order masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population is a small group of finance aristokraten.
A world in which every newborn deaths in childbirth is a chip implanted this nature of total control.
"and it is that the big and the small, the rich and the poor, the Free and the Knechte all a Malzeichen say their right hand or to face that nobody can buy or sell, he had because the Malzeichen, namely the animal's name or the number of its name.
Here is wisdom, anyone who has sense of wonder the number of the animal.
Because it is a human figure, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig."

The film Argo: If Hollywood's worst, call
In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution which for decades the Patronat on his regime had maintained.
For the US government, there have been no positive way out of this situation, they could not afford to throw away, the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the creation of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent the hostage fiasco in violent attempt exemption only made matters worse.
The captured diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government had been.
The fate of the hostages, a wave of solidarity at home and antiiranischer sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter in the presidential election against Ronald Reagan in 1980.
The film Argo of director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode this history, a small part of the US victory.
Just before the occupation of the message, six staff the flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA has succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; helped them a "story to Verdeckung their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film Drehorte stabes allegedly in the country for a science-fiction film visited.
Combination of Genres
The experts for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywood.
So that the cover was credible, article on this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of different film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie," i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film levels of the atmosphere - on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen from Teheran (in the title sequence ikonische contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there is no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and easy überspitzt therefore.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions, men in suits at the meeting table, the official fluren, on the phone...
Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable relaunch his career.
From a belächelten actor has become a respected director, as well as actors, he is no longer the objective ironic comments.
ARGO is his third movie The after the whodunit No children's (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is not in the Afflecks first film, the native of Boston director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was being one of the characteristics that the previous films this contrasted with the standard Hollywood director.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran played by Canada `."
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the opening sequence of storming the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and gives, the sense of Verwirrtheit and unpredictability, once that happens, if somewhere history.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong movie stab at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much in too many places to act
The director also had to deal with that history is actually not many in the cinematographic sense offers exciting scenes.
He has worked with the few but it quite successful, and sometimes a bit of reality nachhilft, which then not always seems so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran by a telephone call in America is avoided, or persecution hunt on the runway, something curious).
The weakness of Argo is too broad distribution, which is due to the need, too much in too many places to act to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in their roles as Hollywood staff are very charming, but more room deserve their characters in the film, and they are far from alone.
Afflecks film loses a little traction as a result. It is a film you with some interest and the design and the Retro reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years-style can approve.
Enthusiasm, it is difficult.
As a reminder of a living piece of history and to date in certain ways as proof of how excessive but notions of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services, but it is enough.

Directives for inflating balloons, bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey of the oddest bank charges, has decided that the competition this year `absurdeste regulation or idea from the EU to hold workshop."
"on this idea has brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan, a 40% quota of women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, for dealing with the organization of this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities such is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
In the meantime women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are strictly a lower risk for the insurance companies.
"further incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
On the controversial EU regulations, including the binding to mixing bioethanol fuel in its wake naturschädigend is, the more the banning of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount this hazardous material, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, this year because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism 81st in the past, the ban on the use of the term "butter spreads" or even ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels usually are represented by one or more Member States (for example, currently the Czech Republic is trying, with veto threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that banana the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must show a "Krümmungsanomalie".
The European Commission argued with the argument that they only the mixed national standards harmonisiere, handicapping the trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables from the EU in the face of opposition from some countries were already weakened by pointing out that the previous directives would lead to a loss of food.
A candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU regulation last year in accordance with balloons to sales by pointing out that children under the age of eight air balloon must not without adult supervision of a aufblasen.
The EU citing an American study in accordance with balloons are the leading cause suffocation of children.
A similar restriction is already using Jahrmarktströten for children up to 14 years.
There are also curious incursions at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that the European officials themselves-anyone who has an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece cannot use the name Macedonia and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above-mentioned. Absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU, so that the maximum volume of food supplies to the day of our EU accession located on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic crossed then canned mushroom set volume, for which we have a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or the idea of funding for applications for grants.
But these ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are put at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will refund apply to the EU, "said in the autumn of 2004 the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument is that the grain harvest was very high and the government camp as a result of the so-called. Be intervention purchases were overcrowded.
As the Czech Republic, the EU should have a path to seaports according Palas paying hundreds of millions of euros to us.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered communities the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US DEU), specifically, it has to be the means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen act to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are somewhat in the Member States a target of criticism, the EU's efforts for regulation and hence effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition.
A serious problem, according to these experts tend to be the EU funding for projects absolutely have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations were forced by individual Member States.
Emotions here also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic similar to other Member States in Brussels for the right to use specific names traditional products have to fight this battle and not always wins.
The Czech Republic has been following a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky' defend Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dating back to the 19th century with us, but our manufacturers in" Tuzemák "had to rename.
The name rum can only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products are registered in the EU in the society of the world-famous cheeses feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinkens now the Karlsbad Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops.
With a EU brand, because the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or Hořicer roles pride.

"I want the Republic rette, but I am just an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr Senator, as is the idea to stand for the presidency?
It is not my intention, Senator or to be president.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I would stand nowhere.
But I can no longer with the Republic plundered for 20 years, as thieves walk free, while the people's taxes and increasing the retirement age.
I had no ambitions, politicians.
But when I see something that I do not like, then I am trying to propose a solution to change it.
And as I am more than 40, and that independent and parteilos, I have no option but to influence things to run for senator or the president.
In the Senate, you have managed and then go straight to the road in the castle.
Are turning their backs on you will not your constituents?
I have said all the time that I the fight to Burg them after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later I have this clarified and said that I will be a candidate for the office of president, if I am elected senator.
But my aim is not the function. The role is an instrument, with whom I can carry out my vision.
I do not need as much influence and a possible this strong mandate.
But the problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television rant knock, but everyone who wants to make a difference.
Then there are the media want to deprive the honor, and the confuse the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
About me, for example, claimed that I would journalists bribe or that I was Jiří Paroubek consultants.
We are talking about your vision.
The fight for the Burg you have with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and retrospective assets of more than 20 million kronor.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole may bring legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
As ordinary citizens, I have argued that the tour guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy, if someone from the right or left with a good proposal is rejected this deliberately, and the population is only.
As an independent parteiloser I have a much greater potential to win support from all the political parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of each party can take what is best for our country.
See you as a person in politics rather right or left?
From Czech point of view, it seems to me that I am inclined to see people left.
For me, this is right-left political thinking but completely irrelevant.
I think it is important that we make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone on the left or the right, and I would like to human beings.
I always support publicly any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or of the ODS, and I will turn against bad ideas.
It is you, if someone called populists.
But you can't confirm this, what you have just said?
If you in a company set up a business plan, then you will have an ideal destination and a vision.
And you want to this approach.
You can call it as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world, or they were discussed by important experts.
Without support in Parliament, however, you just slogans.
And so that you cannot do too much in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you just long enough, you talk to the people, for example, will be able to enforce the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them on our side to achieve these aims.
As president, it would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to call on the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law.
And the Angesprochenen if necessary, to say why they oppose it.
A strong personality, which refers to abuses, can put pressure on the political scene.
Let you take the direct election of the president, which was a credit to the public pressure.
I would like to make it quite clear that I am an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
With the politics, I just starting and try to find the support of the majority, for my program.
I always try to assess things for themselves; and if it fails, then I am going to six years back to the private sector.
It sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that my own nothing can; therefore, I spoke with several famous people about whether it does not want to run for the Senate.
I have for example, Radim Jančura spoken, but rejected for work.
Also, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová detected the fraud in trade with easy fuel oil.
My candidacy I began with the premise that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the electorate are not at all to the elections, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
We are in only two independents in the Senate.
People have such an elected Senate composition that changes it will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example for the election of mayors and district of men.
Think about the establishment of a separate party?
I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to review the past each potential party member, and certainly do not have the money.
I do not even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
They have no money?
They talk of asset declarations, what would your?
I appreciate my personal fortunes around 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a piece of land, with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth around one million. And then I have a couple of million in the bank.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream-James Bond did I have always been, as he was driving galant on women in the car while fighting against evil.
They drive an Aston Martin, have a net worth of $60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you do not want to invest in it.
It is not exactly convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
I have to make debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I had no sponsors, shows that my program is not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny that the campaign out of its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will be basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live by Senator close budget alone; I could, for example, my son not the English school finance, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
So you are still active as entrepreneurs, in order to have your livelihood?
You said that you did not these activities will be cut?
But that is not linked to the level of salary.
As promised, I have my activities partly reduced.
Thus, for example, my deputy director in the spring of travel agents.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan saves the Republic.
But I have also of something live.
You were used as entrepreneurs in which monthly income?
Around 200,000 to 400,000, and continue to do so.
As President, I think businesses would stop.

The architects MVRDV prove that the real adventure are not only in the head, in the case of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books mountain - 2 photos
"I think the building, it is futuristisch, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a roadside Passantin.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby Großbetrieb, says: "But, it is beautiful, the House."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and E Books.
No one is still voluntarily in one of these old-Style-libraries, or?
Spijkenisse, a little town at the gates Rotterdams besichtigungsbedürftige sleep is sonderbarer record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants-community, the lowest rate in the Netherlands on education.
In order to counter this stupid fact, it was decided a few years ago, contribute to education and the seven imaginary bridges, the seem to the euro, as nicely bepinselte steel beton miniaturen depicted.
The success of the education with some limited offensive.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way, the statistics should Mr: A library.
Winy Maas by the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of Tollkühnen Balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen, often cynical buildings, the matter with his usual composure and appeared to competition in 2003 with five books hearing the rich and a grin on the face.
And while the jury is still intrigued eyes and with the Achseln zuckte, stapelte the impudent Maas its fine Mitbringsel according to the size of a pyramid and ended his speech has underpinned aktionistisch with the words: "Dear city community!"
It is, therefore, my proposal for the books mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg.
Nine years later, the 30 million euro expensive mountain aufgeschüttet.
It is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts, including underground car park, supermarket, postal services and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books with the second "Best Library of NL 2012' excellent.
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
So that is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte that to date no longer had to offer as a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind its white façades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, just a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to books
The first impression: Books eldorado under glass.
There is a lift, the middle around the massif, but the real space and reading freuden unlock the fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The totally gun-shy Klinker verglaste indoor is bright and clear, on the bed and the elegant street lights are clearly the language of a public city.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It is already looking for parking Bank, dog and football boys and Mädels's.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"usually, the books shelves along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark area, which is usually uncomfortably and impersonal way," says Winy Maas.
We have the classic area konfiguration upside down and the reading area from inside out gestülpt.
The interior of the mountain of books is shrewdly: In the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental technology center and House central.
A particular pleasure is the black books shelves, which can Wandverkleidung, Brüstung or Stiegengeländer.
Pulp and Haptik and smell are removed.
Even die-hard architects and Civil Engineers at the unknown Baustoffs shake their heads.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," says Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city community Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen Agrarbetrieb one day on a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies a source document.
This is cheap and zeiteffizient.
The slender textiles one or two Saisonen, then it is ready for the Sperrmüll.
For the library was the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimeters thick plates pressed.
Under the so-called Landbouwplastic (exposure to heat and pressure verfärbt KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, belastungsfähigen material that a bissl after new cars and a bissl reeks of sports footwear.
After 105 stages, reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long travels at Literaturcafé, will not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also with Dutch Kroketten and eingetopften Ficusbäumen rewarded.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in literature gebirge.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it is, but this is a flagship project despite the many glass land in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and will be kept cool with geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books under a glass of fall, the sun is shining even on sunny days just interior.
The binder wood glue, the right to the outside glass, serve as Beschattung and begin a large part of the sun.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest fully automated Rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics in the IT industry, dared the way in the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even Spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: Every residents to open a few weeks ago was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
It should start by the optical gaps in the not yet fully bestückten library currently 70 of them-be filled.
The concept is good enough.
The shelves are filled by obenhin.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think everyone inhabitants, thanks to our invitation now has a certain relationship with this new House.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
And if it is merely to grace.
In doing so, MVRDV those King discipline managed, called the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse has scored literature.
It may be as young and uneducated.
This is finally a starting point for identity.

Szabo: "German must play greater role '
Germany has been in the abstained from voting on the opening of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US European relations,'re Berlin to a narrow diplomatic level.
German wave: Germany had indicated earlier this week that it violates the request for observer status for the Palestinians were to vote at the United Nations.
But then abstained from Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo, Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, but be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany abstained also, when it came to enforce a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Germany find it hard to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it's true.
This is because it is surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that was swept away by the US gemanaged, towards a German foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are also among the fronts.
It expects them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to.
I believe that they are still remember their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, like France or Britain.
Which means a "normal" foreign policy as it from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to national interests to take positions that are independent of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN had?
On the one hand, Germany major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, there must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not offending.
This will play a role in any case.
But I would not to attach too much importance to the, this is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by chose to abstain on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
Consequently, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.
Because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international players and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, have a clear message for a veto.
There are some differences between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always exists because of American domestic politics.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government this position publicly, of course, cannot represented.
I believe that the real differences are not so great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so upbeat of Netanyahu's policy.
It is difficult for Germany to its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the most important partner in the EU's position on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position.
This is precisely what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, in view of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans are well aware that they have a more independent role to play.
Germany itself is in its role as a major global players-Germany wants to play a major role in the first place?
Or is the lead Germany still difficult?
Germany is not accustomed to this is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it hard to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany will adopt a greater role, a variety of German feelings.
It is not just the Germans.
This is the old problem: You would not be surrounded by hostile countries.
Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be susceptible to a variety of neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
Now, the US influence in European politics continuously, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who is otherwise?
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them, making them even more unpopular, c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo, deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together to the challenges of the transatlantic community research.

"trademark protection" in China: If Puma and Armani suddenly be Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
There is an officially registered name in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
But she enjoys protection as long as the real name of employers not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether will get justice.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Patt layer, lawyer in the services Taylor Wessing, which is specialised in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The clones are already a few additional letter so that they can register their trademarks.
So just Lu, Gucci, Prada, Gucci, Prada-Kny register.
German companies also are legally copied in this way, such as sports equipment manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a file with registration of trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company the trademark Zegna DF Puma protect, an art names, which is also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese world champion in the copying and injured are intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities there are mehrstöckige department stores, which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
Stalemate hole cases but on behalf of his clients are different: He does to deal with the fact that Chinese companies from the trademarks agency officially given the right to use a name, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
These women are that the rich men angling.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"That is deprive, it must be fought," calls for stalemate hole.
"The brand is watered down the Alleinstellung disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and the Prozesskosten the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the market research company CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year's third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But erased dubious entries in brands register are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
Up to nine years can drag on the procedure, with an uncertain outcome.
Stalemate hole reports of cases in which the court complaints prompted because, after the long duration of the beanstandete name to "market had become reality."
If the plaintiff misfortune, he must have the Plagiator even pay money, because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, the company that recently took over the German pump concrete planter Putzmeister.
The Chinese must still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyers Geely, originally a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturers Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous Crocodile look in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The trademarks agency CTMO in Beijing to that there is 2010 for lack of staff and space equipment shortages.
Last year, the "emergency but normality in the business."
It is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure has declined by 22%.
Almost 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than in the previous year.
But in the office are still waiting 81.500 objections to carry out.
Address it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
It is a record and means that the list of China on the tenth consecutive Neuanmeldungen all over the world, shares the authority.
The line of reasoning would also apply to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011 are 1.8 billion yuan in fees earned.
Simplified, this means that any notification on average 1280 yuan or costs EUR 160.
Address it costs much joy, as the case of the German family business mountain shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been struggling against a Chinese Plagiator.
Although the Germans achieve that was lifted the illegal manufacture of imitation of motor vehicle parts.
But the counterfeiters secured to the Chinese brand rights joy.
We missed the family name, as in Germany could not be protected, said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of joy mountain Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademarks agency CTMO rejected the opposition of the Munich as well.
In the next two bodies, joy mountain may be right, but the Prozessgegner fighting until today.
We have to höllisch careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "the procedure is extremely expensive and is costing us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs would be difficult to quantify, the company archive have even one hundred years old files they need in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, offered joys of opposition in vain a "high six-figure euro amount" to resolve.
"this shows you how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even after Europe zurückzuschwappen.
Then, if there Imitatoren vulnerable brands.
It was a Chinese manufacturer in Germany the name pleasures mountain on shoes and leather.
This area of business, the company has already abandoned, but he could avert the registration.
"You höllisch must be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole rates German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should "everything somehow register is worth protecting, including in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if joy mountain last act of his trademark dramas too, then it is the other side should pay royalties on their own behalf, said Wentzler.
Or we will segment in question squeezed out of the market.

AIDS Day: Stampfen, help
At Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi - and in Swaziland satisfaction, children orphaned by AIDS.
The story of a link that far more than 8733 kilometres.
First, there is the stampfen: Cowboy stiefel, basketball shoes, Damenpumps and gentlemen slipper in bed for the tact, find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voice of the singer slowly emerging-old, bass, tone and Sopran-press, betören and follow.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, it almost from its substance shoes, if it brings together with its elastic wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, the music area of the Institute for Medizinische psychology at Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi a new song.
Of the 50 Sängerinnen and singer came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin to the householder.
"om Obani" is not an easy step, every chorus agree with another text and do this in a very foreign language: Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV in the world, the UNAIDS estimates that the United Nations program to fight against AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
Living in Swaziland 245000 children orphaned by AIDS.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For the club has 180 children orphaned by AIDS in the village of Esitjeni Voices for Africa godfather found in Germany.
70 of them are secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can play a sponsor.
It guarantees the child, Schuluniform tuition and a warm meal every day in the Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu stories erzähler or Lobpreiser.
Fluent in the Bantusprache can sing, but no one in this area.
For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this foreign soft language and also brings them and to get back where they originally came from, in the southern Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the German Chores Stimmgewalt.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large number of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents, because they are HIV resistance.
In Esitjeni is reflected in the small, what in Swaziland is: High HIV infection rate lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Restrictions on freedom of male Vorhaut, the proven to reduce by half the risk of contagion, by the people won't be adopted.
More than 40 per cent of people in Swaziland bear the immunodeficiency virus, with center 30 to die is not uncommon.
In a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the chorus discovered the village, but above all saw the Imbongis many children in the streets, which are not only lacked parental care, but simply of everything: Food, clothing, education.
Without school in a poor country was certainly no chance.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later founded the chorus "Voices for Africa" the club, which has since then almost professional care about the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STI syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI, Humane Pappilomaviren are HIV, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzläuse and Krätze are among the parasite STI.
Who are the most vulnerable groups?
Syphilis and Tripper come mainly among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of Germany-reported syphilis cases transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In the heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren often occurring sexually-transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults here is comparatively small, however, about 20% of HIV infections account for this group.
Among young people are chlamydia infections far more frequent than in other sections of the population.
According to European surveys affect three-quarters of all infections young people between 15 and 25 years.
Here are often also Humane Pappilomaviren among young people.
How has the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.
The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 in 2001 to 3698 disease more than doubled in 2011.
The number of HIV infections since 2007.
There were around 2 700 cases in 2011.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can ulcers in Genitalbereich, urinate, complaints to the flow, Unterbauchschmerzen and Bläschen or Warzen.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection.
Because partly agent sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by Schmierinfektionen and close physical contact.
Therefore recommend experts in particular often changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups.
Diagnosed early and repercussions cured most STI can be avoided.
By godmothers, donations and, last but not least, the Gagen, the chorus throughout Germany ersingt, some come together.
"overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself managed Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and durchsetzungsstarke woman who money from Germany.
They are also considering that the orphans well accommodated in one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as we call the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have included up to 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms schooling appear on time every day.
Anyone who has no one else comes into obstruction of protection Khanyisile, a single woman who will be paid by the club in the same way as the two cooks, every day for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa" has also launched a Nähschule, two chicken houses built and in conjunction with the American Health Organisation PSI organised a HIV test that many in the village have let.
This is not a foregone conclusion, because the disease throughout the country is so obvious that they are ideally dead silence.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state sanctioned life that the HIV has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms exist in every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another-flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange something, the Imbongi-chorus every two or three years jointly by the South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern light on the black continent even in times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition does not only mood and joy, but has also been some fierce border guards a few tears abgetrotzt.
The trip continues even after Esitjeni, where the singer visit their godchildren.
Even though the small village on maps little, in the valley of the river Ezulweni it is more than aware.
"after Esitjeni, there is the light" say the people there.
And if the 8733 kilometres returns to Heidelberg, stampfenden Sängern in the test area in the Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shine as well.

Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Mercury
The special messenger has found evidence that there is on the planet Mercury ice.
The ice sheet is possibly up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are some frozen water, as three on Thursday in the journal Science "published studies have shown.
The special messenger have found evidence that it constantly in the region of the planet a shadow in the ice sheet.
This is at least 30 centimeters and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
The water was probably may also of comet or asteroid, which are taken on the Mercury.
No one brings the discovery of ice but linked to the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the messenger-special, said Sean Solomon.
The temperature in the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the discovery could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, to explore the depths of space.
From time to time they send images to earth: Small Gucklöcher in interminable showed.

Our insights into space: The main telescopes
The telescope should be 1608 by Hans Lipperhey invented-even before Galileo Galilei it a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes have been increasing and the insights that they provide deeper.
30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego the world's largest Fernrohr.
The mirror, in this picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope.
We can look into space on equal to, each with two mirror 8.4 metres in diameter.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias Kanareninsel on La Palma is huge-alone is the mirror to 10.4 metres in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres.
Detriment of good design: The telescope is in his heights of ground to a halt - and thus in his limited mobility.
Also the hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is caught up in the heights of view.
Their special: The high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is, despite comparatively low mirror installation - to the world's largest mirror dispatch.
With the help of a radio teleskops in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers the All after Außerirdischen signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) each computer owners can help by computing power available.
Look at the observatory waiting for the European star (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope, which is worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors the Fernrohr can also median Infrarotspektrum ausleuchten.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory is the European extremely Large Telescope.
Its main levels will include fat 42 metres - and almost a thousand mirror elements together.
With images, but until 2018.
By 2007, the two were girl-telescopes on the root volcano Mauna KEA as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirror with an average of 10 metres.
The girl-telescopes are part of the Mauna KEA Observatory, which provides them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF looks to the sky.
Also on Mauna KEA to create a new, huge telescope with a mirror-average of 30 metres.
Here is an illustration to gaze at.
The main impressions from the space, but the space telescope Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990 it already images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler is seeking extra solar planets-mainly for such the inhabitable.
On 2 February 2011 was announced by NASA that 1235 planet candidates identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the last launch preparations for the space telescope Kepler documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) until 2018 on board the Ariane5 rocket fired into space.
The Primärspiegel of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: In light of the first stars and galaxies look after the Big Bang.
Scientists are working on the assumption that the South Pole of Mercury ice exists.
However, there is no reliable data, as the messenger far closer to the North Pole about the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades to hingedeutet that there are on the Mercury ice.

Many people in the south of Azerbaijan achieve a biblisch high age.
There is even a Museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97 is still relatively young.
The journey by the Talysch mountains is wildromantisch.
The Kleinbus rumpelt on the curves of roads, past densely forested hills, reißenden rivers and simple farmers.
Everything is green and will mount, one could be forgiven for thinking that it is in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of the border with Azerbaijan, Iran is only a few miles away.
Here the Caucasian Talyschen segment of the population is living, not much is known, except that it speaks perfect Persian and Aserisch and is very durable.
Destination is Lerik.
The small city flaunts to wuchtig geratener architecture from Soviet times, as does not fit into the scenic mountain landscape will.
Tourists come from Europe is hardly here, too onerous the period from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours, because the road is only einspurig.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the Eurovision Song Festival famous, and next year we have here a festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the museum of longevity, the only in the world.
Here is the vita of around eight dozen Talyschen documented in the area, the more than 100 Fatulayeva shows a black and white oto.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of a child born 136 years ago
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, should have become the 168 years old.
However, there is not a birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but highly dubious.
" 1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explained Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, aged between 136 years he should have a daughter born.
Has Şirali Müslümov also in his age by a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard about the Hochbetagten in Central Asia.
"striking number hochaltrige people, there is also in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also live in Sardinia lots of very old men."
But due to a lack of documentation is no scientific proof of age, because people were register.
Every day, ashtray geschmolzene butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik striking often reach a biblisches age.
There are currently 20 people who are more than 100 years old.
So why live here in the south so many hochbetagte?
The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the with the specific genes Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that the food is.
But it is the calories of Talyschen as healthy diet should be above all dairy products, meat, bread and love, many of whom drink a glass of geschmolzene butter on a daily basis, from a nutritional point of view is not just plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that young people? In Lerik Cengemiran, a tiny settlement from the city, sits Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants live in a simple wood, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground with a Butterfass they tirelessly - and herrollt.
Eight people live under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Also two young children jump around.
In the kitchen to prepare tea, the guests in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu served glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and link under her headscarf they long dunkelblonde Zöpfe revealed that her son before us proud.
I have always with milk washed my hair, so they were never from me and kept their color.
"I have never used," says Mirzayeva shampoo.
Monthly pension is for life
She has always only eat what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not once bought in a supermarket food.
Then they told by her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar" Aliyew took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is being driven by the nation's father figure, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, later took his son Ilham the helm.
After all, there is no need in Azerbaijan elderly.
230 Manat (roughly the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for a sum here, which we can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long ergrauter son right: "the elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared and are happy.
If this is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive

The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia law as a basis is hotly contested.
The Egyptian President sparte not with emotion.
We must create the transition.
"and that it is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but especially well the Coptic Christians, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular.
In a confused, because they all hopelessly divided opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on Nile of grace the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had, Mohamed Morsi said almost entschuldigend, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily cut and expanded his powers, "in order to save the revolution."
But what the 61 years engineer, which bears a doctorate of the American University of Südkalifornien, really wants to save as Egyptians, the world is not very much aware.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles that dominated by the Islamist 100-person Constituent Assembly as a night, 15, stündigen Parforceritt were pushed through, partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says, the jurisdiction grounds on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is meant by "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists the vague wording and the attendant legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law will use.
That suggests at least a newly hinzugeführter Article: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al Ashar University zurate, the country's main Islamic institution with great clout throughout the Sunni Islam.
It does not have, but it may mean that the clergy overseeing the legislation, which would lead to de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should continue to remain.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The government should also, it says in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morals and values."
The wording is legally so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even could control the content of cinema and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article, writes explicitly equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy to insult or to slander.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Also dubious is the wording of the "insulting people," is forbidden.
Is there has been a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of Leader?
Interpretation, as much in the design, Morsi to sign before and after his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down, the Charter, before it can be put into effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will prevail," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said, the draft Constitution belong "on the scrapheap of history."
Via Twitter Kurznachrichtendienst he accused supporters Morsi, they want to lead a "coup against democracy.
"If he devoted the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the opposition Yasser Said.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brothers arrested is not yet," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not be that it is going to monitor invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organised Muslim Brotherhood inflated to Gegendemonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayers on the other Nilufer before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, attended and chanted "the people calling for the application of the law of God."
They invited by Morsi: "Säubere the country!" and protested: "the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where anything began, would's conditions.
The Morsi's supporters clearly did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists is safe.
"The word `human rights is not even"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this speed up the constitutional process that you have gone until February and should involve all social forces.
Of the 48 years human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because it human rights are indivisible.
That is what he was convicted, imprisoned, beaten.
"and now the word `human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complained in conversation with the "world" on Sunday.
Morsi power expansion in all three branches in the state, the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and Egypt in a new dictatorship.
"rather than strengthening civil society. The President de facto repeal it," complained Saeda.
But without civil society organizations cannot work a democracy.
Saeda feels alone, even by the international community, the ideological direction campaign on Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could be revenge.
A protestor in the Tahrir warns: "You gebährt a monster that it cannot control."

Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants Norway enjoy the highest standard of living - and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country with the local appetite for something quite übelriechenden fish?
Take a selection überreifer cheeses.
They are in the midst of a crowd dirty feuchter platziere sports clothing.
And they leave that a week.
Just about has to imagine the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the great Delikatessen Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes and the intractable smell in the air, just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, depending on how stinkend its fish would like-up to a year in water ferments.
If Norway is the darkness of the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians flock to a party here in Fagernes, the, well, really very bestechenden speciality.
"you eat it raw and carries it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who was working in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General" the festival.
Around us people eat small fish cube and take large quantities of alcohol.
"Mansche people may Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can smell.
I cost some packaged.
If it avoids Rakfisk to bring the nose, it is not a bad thing, such as sushi, which has been a coach for quite a long time.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no Kühlmöglichkeiten and fish in a dense, wet salt water barrels this autumn.
He was then removed after a long Fermentierung in the deepest winter and undoubtedly under using alcohol consumed-tempered end.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work and forced to leave their country, mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly-more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, it was not too long ago was far richer than Norway, flows immigrants.
Rakfisk is seen as important as an essential, albeit strictly riechender part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive courts, which can buy here.
But everything here is really expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euro.
Norway fails often in the world press, and most people seems not to disrupt the.
Here are still hates it Anders Breivik to name - the racist right-wing extremists, the last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead it refers only to the "incident of 22 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Norway is primarily responsible for today's wealth since the early 1970's growth of the world's largest oil and Gasindustrien.
"but oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waiter who round trays with reifem Rakfisk distributed and the stechend with her long blonde hair and blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
As the saying goes, we are a sensible people.
Her English is exactly like that of most people here above reproach.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting.
Norway is handled very careful with its oil wealth, a large part of the industries yields will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, all with money raised it does not, Norway had closed its purse.
"As long as we ski in winter and in the summer, can go, we are happy," Anna says.
"and of course Rakfisk eat," it adds with unbeschwertem laughter.
I am in the snow and am Rakfisk to another court-I have enough.
This elk burger is definitely something else. I enjoy the juicy meat.
But in the evening the Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel where I logiere, is one of several Olympic venues resorts to organise a Rakfisk dinner where guests for the best-or perhaps the most challenging smell sense-fish can vote.
There is a live TV on which a bird served Showmaster, which is surrounded by tables with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What point number you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"here are our points, Havard."
The Grand Coalition and laughs.
A man is overwhelmed by his chair, possibly by the aquavit.
But it is perhaps the strict form of the whole fish.

Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico's President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to office, Will Grant analyzed by the BBC challenges and the mixed feelings of its people.
Currently is particularly bad traffic in Mexico City.
Even in better days, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday, a ring of steel built, several important transport routes in the capital absperrt and is causing havoc on the roads.
However, the aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto binde the president and the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon's was able to prove economically Mexico, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which in the past six years already has cost 60,000 lives.
"My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," said Pena Nieto earlier this week the US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
With the US president before he was on an equal footing, Pena Nieto Mexico as governor of his home state.
In this densely populated, rambling part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the divided opinions on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town Valle del Bravo they, for example, to remember him.
Inhabitants of the holiday site write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to achieve the city, you can travel on one of the highways, which Pena Nieto and build a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy road, which was here.
Badges with his name, outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him real and lasting change," his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the congressman for the party Pena Nietos works, the PRI.
Especially with regard to security and economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The congressmen Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The allegations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He was a man of great direct, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was an outstanding statesman, especially if it but also listen to someone who can.
But on the other side of the Heads of many people do not share this view on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are crucial urban in nature.
Earlier this year, the military, in order to combat drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spots land near a large landfill in the last two years alone were the bodies of dozens of murdered women.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto in the state of Mexico more than 1,000 women have been murdered, a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which for their violence and the killing of innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that the problem of feminicide during his tenure at least is not properly addressed.
But in the worst case, his government have closed their eyes to the problem.
In a Betonbau, typical of the rundown neighborhoods, fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as I think they are photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows.
According to the official version of events Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
But her family believes that it was murdered by their partners.
"When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if their bodies have been washed," remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that they had been beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already started.
While their mother told that their history of the wall a picture of Mariana down to us. It is not only a cross appropriate that takes a single word: Justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, have been denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin Nörglerin.
They want their verdict simply be accepted and shut up.
"But this is not possible, if there were so many flaws and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the president receives binde, he is also a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of Mexican families were affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised during his tenure, particularly in order to take care of this problem.
"I hope that as president, he is so, as he was as Governor," says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But it is precisely the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.

The prosecutor's office said: Bradley Manning has not complained about mistreatment
The prosecution against Bradley Mannings allegations that he was tortured in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense is a rejection of the indictment by too harsh prison conditions in
The US Army Corporal accused of thousands of confidential documents to have stolen
The public prosecutor's office on Friday tried to note that the army gefreite Bradley Manning, indicted for the largest disclosure of confidential information in the US history-missed several opportunities to which he allegedly suffered ill-treatment in military confinement to complain.
In a cross-examination Mannings during a: Hearing in FT. Meade, Maryland said Maj. Ashden Fein that documents to weekly visits, the prison officers while Mannings neunmonatiger prison term in Quantico, Virginia, had made no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, the result of a request by the defense to reject the charge was held-Manning was due to the harsh prison term had already been punished enough, Manning said that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The US Army's Geheimdienstanalyst, who was arrested in June 2010, during his service in Iraq is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
At the hearing on Friday was Fein with Manning the forms, the officials after their meeting with Manning during his arrest in Quantico-military prison, where he had filled in July 2010 to April 2011 under better conditions had eingesessen.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
As Fein him on Friday to the forms, he, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment as a result of the establishment as "very professional" had.
The forms, Fein, contained no complaints about mistreatment, although officials Manning had directly asked about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and officials have discussed this with him and declared to deal with this. They are not, however, been recorded.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns)" no problems "and not necessarily this meant that I absolutely nothing," Manning said.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning asked why he has not complained about his treatment in January 2011, when he met with a committee, which he mentioned suicide several months in advance to a form of ideas.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting had consisted, his observation status to "prevention of injury herabstufen."
The military said that it had him this restrictive status - one stage under the suicide risk - on his and the protection of other allocated.
"I wanted to convince people that I was doing well and get rid of the Monitoring status on the prevention of injury (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before it in July 2010 in the prison in the naval base was moved Quantico in Virginia.
He said that he had considered the suicide in Kuwait and was due to the heat even become unconscious.
We cannot know what with him or in the outside world is, was burdensome.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, these caged together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
We have only a mattress and a blanket Flip him-Flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said that he had tried to stay in movement, because the day was not permitted to sleep or even ground.
Always have to sleep with the lights, he moved from the outside in his cell.
When he turned at night, and guards were unable to see his face, who have been him so that resuming zurückdreht.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday asked the judge Manning also to an accusation that he had made in his statement on Thursday, he had a night in his cell naked in Quantico sleep and a morning count naked before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity during this count, with its blanket umhüllen.
At the hearing on Friday was Manning, he had from a closed that he ordered his watch the ceiling, with which he can cover, it should drop. He was, however, that nobody had called for him.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had in the previous night had been forced to sleep naked. He tried to show an official earlier that he poses no danger for themselves.
The federal Manning told officials that he had his trousers or Flip-Flops can use to injure themselves, but not enough.
In this night, Manning said, are his underwear, Flip Flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge to at least take account of his arrest and drastically reduce Haftmaß will be, he should be tried in his trial before the military tribunal. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will commit less crime guilty, while other charges, which are considered too extreme, should be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. By the Prosecutor's Office is expected to justify the detention conditions.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions, for all of the highest security arrangements in Quantico verwahrten prisoners.
Among the charges against Manning are aiding the enemy, illegal publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.

My mexikanisch American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they remind them difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just been running warehouse and arrived at the border, when a broad in my mind.
Signs pointed to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I was a few seconds, uncertain, which I go.
I grew up in Zentralkalifornien and all my life was called "Mexicans."
An ethnic acronym-just as my friends in Boston `Irish' or my friends in New York `Italians' .
Later I opted for `mexikanisch Amerikanisch."
But this was Mexico.
My grandfather's and at home there was no need for acronyms or hyphenation.
I was simply Americans.
I am speaking Spanish, at least good enough to me in this language at both ends of interviews.
But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers, and my American accent I will also.
So I took my American passport and undertook in the queue for Extranjeros.
This week, I thought about that moment when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House, in order to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that can be expected, when the heads of these two countries: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans are now as likely to remain in Mexico, rather than to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and a North American trading bloc after example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the Mexico's war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and the country's leaders among vorgehaltenem gun, forced them to leave more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans in centuries and are not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be ignored.
Therefore, once a US government officials even mildest criticism of Mexico, listening - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites-complaints about how the Americans currently dogging the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children Montezumas, on the war path.
And yet is Mexico's biggest challenge in truth in Mexico's relationship with the more than 35 million Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio live, is that at a point in our family tree of a person, perhaps a parents "or Großelternteil, offered no chance in Mexico, and immigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person was a profile-dunkelhäutig, uneducated, from a poor village, etc..
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, visited good schools and good jobs have received, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live-not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes vague, but what our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is certainly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as monument a humiliating defeat and look to us, because we are not sufficiently mexikanisch.
Our Spanish never good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
They argue that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families not in Mexico has not failed, they would be gone.
And then we would now see not caught behind the silk screen, with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and einwanderte legally in the United States as a child, I am reminded that tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans are taking this evil.
While it is US citizen, it feels as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans know that I have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It is the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we will be seen as an American.
And we are seen as Mexicans in the United States.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that this relationship complicates: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bürgertums would resume their links to the diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should our American colleagues about how great a visit this country is and to exert pressure on the political leadership to step up its ties with Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And given the unequal income distribution, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it really is a great country.
I fear that you alone, amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to deal with Mexico, the United States, one and a half centuries, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a resentment for how their families were treated only not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.
Amid the usual blame, countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new and uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to its end.
A war that will not be lost or won
At first blush, optimism anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, have strengthened the week's fighting the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have the Israelis rolled back, even though his group had to great loss.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
Indeed Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power that once was considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent, from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren, before the Stürzung Bashar Assad could be to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the King.
Under President Mohamed Morsi and, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt-by far the einwohnerstärksten and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has greatly altered the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular tyrant who ruled Egypt until his overthrow 2011 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders more dependent on public opinions.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove player Hamas, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
On the other hand, the Israeli hardliners opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer dangerous.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," was able to prove and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israel will not be able to sleep more soundly at least for a while.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in their position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process largely ignored.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, the country remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the Sperranlagen, which in the West Bank and the bulk of an eventual Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. This to protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared to be illegal, but always be developed.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud Party, in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman allied with an even kämpferischeren group.
Why this hinterlistigen Palestinians verhätscheln and allow them to make their own state?
If it really had control over the West Bank, it would not just like their supporters in Gaza rocket fire?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish, should they dare to raise the heads.
Perhaps be able to get the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could a thwarted them.
Even if the Islamists, who now sit in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments little help to repair their economies.
That the pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust to bring about a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which is undoubtedly one day will explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just exploded as a bus in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
Bloody missions to combat Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years will increasingly take its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outside
The answer is that the more people on both sides, most of the rest of the world and this newspaper: Two states, where Israel surrenders areas for security purposes.
The small - - for the near future hope is that the ceasefire outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now together with Turkey and Qatar stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and Hamas is better positioned than ever to the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by land swaps and a common to convince Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also Hamas and Fatah to get an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Also, Obama must play its part to encourage Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if it were also a reluctant participation.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Australian laws for single cigarette packaging are in force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs, which is the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging came into force in Australia. It will brand logos and colors, and replaced by neutral, olivgrüne lid with graphic images are complicated, which sick body parts and by cigarette smoke sick infants and children.
Aside from the different health warnings and images, from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small letters.
So that Australia is the world's strictest rules on tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to young people smoking, by eliminating the glamorous image of the tobacco.
It is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not started with 26 to smoke, with 99% likely person then no longer use.
"You can already see among children younger age that they understand the message, the tobacco companies are trying to apply with their brand image," Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies have shown that children, for example, a logo with the idea of the Crown Princess associate.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of multinationals, consider other countries have similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
It was said, with the laws would benefit the black market trade, which leads to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
"The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters are far greater quantities of these products offer on the streets of Australia.
Others say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, notes that the demand for cigarettes etuis and silicone cap to cover the intolerable packaging, has grown enormously since the corporations British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago on Australian Supreme Court with their protest against the laws failed.
Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesale transactions and await new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hole in the popularity of social media in precisely the population on the plan.
A number of Australian law has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, forbids them from a sports sponsors, most traders, cigarettes in shops no longer forced to interpret. Now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet changed.
The Australian government has banned online advertising by local companies and sides, however, has no influence on international sides.
"If tobacco marketed and has only a small area, in order to promote its products, on the Internet is not around," says Becky Freeman healthcare, a researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook has Freeman brand, which has been an increase in the number of experience of "ordinary people".
We must ask the question: Is the only an individual who likes Marlboro cigarettes, so much that even includes a video or a marketing agency has to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than concentrate marketing to deal with the new laws.
It has even gone so far, Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay to challenge the new rules, those countries in the World Trade Organisation complain about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for in 2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, the treatments warnings vorschrieb.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiantly.
The images does not affect me.
I simply ignoring them.
"it is simply a touch and the box is away," says Victor El Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes to a photograph with a mouth tumor is printed.
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operators of tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the single packaging has its shelves.
"I have an hour earlier needed to supply einzusortieren, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have simply completely ban cigarettes-then we said OK, that's all we close," he visibly angry adds.

In a constantly elektrisierten world it is nice to be bored as well
This Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts on boredom.
I will not lie.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite nervtötend-even if books, magazines and iPhones (available) and, of course, tax-free shopping.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
If it is up to them, it is for us and our children-OK, sometimes to be bored.
This is the brain forced to lose in interesting line of reasoning, which may promotes creativity.
And because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, are the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no..
I come back.
How many people I am also always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
"The boredom actually has a very long history," he says.
The House panels Pompejis ziert a Latin inscriptions on boredom that dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long reading research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom, experience as "a satisfactory to activity, but it cannot be able to define."
Boredom differs from apathy so that the person is not employed, but would like to be.
In the case of the apathy, there is no rush to do something.
The key experience boredom, he says, in a "disruption of attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
Boredom is almost as well as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions in the problem could be linked, bored people around them or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that is dull, even if we just have difficulties to focus.
In their study "The Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention" - German around: "The untätige minds: The definition of boredom from the point of view of attention," which in September in the journal "Perspectives on psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues" to an earlier experiment, in which participants a band listen a person to read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud TV from neighboring area, which had nothing to do with the content. Other heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard this noise at all.
Those who barely recognisable television, heard said, to feel more boring than the other two groups - they have had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this, and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you a monotonous work, "as the search for faulty products on a factory förderband, music can help us and not to feel bored."
Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom can fight, even by people remain physically more closely.
"studies have shown that children who keep herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to stillsitzen," Professor Fenske.
We will all eventually boring-my late flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly ermüdender film.
But some people bore more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "range in the 1980s to Langeweileanfälligkeit."
On the Richter scale statements such as `many things I have to do, and monotonous "and" I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
Using the scale, researchers found that boys are more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida, particularly the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli.
But generally, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter bunch.
In 1991, communities and Reed Larson, a professor of human development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven or eight times a day with a Pager kontaktierte.
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and do the homework were bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents to feel bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increase or decrease.
However, he was sure that "the youth is seen as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because people in extreme cases it leads to extreme physical risks and gambling or drug addicted to alleviate it, which studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"with the boredom will the brain a say that we should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not always know what it is best to do.
If a is dull and the energy used to play Gitarre and cook, will be happy.
But television can provide for feelings of happiness in the short term, these verflüchtigen but in the long term.
So who his gelangweilten child an iPad, it can distract you from the boredom. However, it has not learned to maintain itself or control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-regulation is conveyed by a situation on the other."
The child learns not only to have more self-control, but also in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not to take a critical view them.
Instead, our objective should be to give us away from the constant activity - and technology berieselung wohlzufühlen.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth only trying to find a way to shut down and relax.
"in an environment in which we are constantly being überstimuliert, it is difficult to deal with, once the noise is silent."

In Colorado, there is no clear guidance for the new Marihuanagesetz
Of the 19 years of community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in the southeast Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: The possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a tune with which he this rauchte.
According to Orozco, he and some friends in a Septembertag with the car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, was summoned Orozco for possession of drugs and drug supplies-Kavaliersdelikte, each labeled with a penalty of $100 - and received a court hearing.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco.
But it is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalise small amounts of marijuana to find the answer in hundreds of smaller drug offences less depends on the law, as the site.
Hundreds of order widrigkeiten that revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures, already dropped.
The police authorities are no longer adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally permitted, once the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts, announced Marihuanadelikte to quote and people are still in court.
At the same time vote several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains, new state licensed Marihuanageschäfte at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which lies east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are perplexed at your head.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have been given a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that Colorado in any case is further ahead than most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. The drug was only there for medical purposes, and then Eigenkonsum legalised.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well in orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Supervisory Authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, known as I - 502, enters into force on 6 December and is also a gray area in the bottom of the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalised.
And unpleasant practice issues must be resolved in this period - for example, as the government imposition of "reasonable access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres in schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.
"location anywhere, it will be difficult for a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group.
On 21 November Chief Oates his staff in Aurora sent an e-mail in which he said that the public prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller Marihuanadelikte among people over 21 years, and that the police "immediately" will not seek Strafanzeigen for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban plans for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana will prevail and drug traffickers would continue to be monitored.
In Weld County in northern Colorado district prosecutor Ken buck a stricter view.
After the vote he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly in order to encourage consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana trial, although many have been indicted for other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to pursue violations, which are the Tatzeitpunkt was crimes," buck said in a statement.
The reactions, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the country club, shows no longer adults for the possession of small quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also chose not to drop all outstanding possession procedures.
"I do not believe that I verschwende my time, the law until it is changing," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado, supported the measure was clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana in line with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state, local officials released a profound dilemma when it comes to the big green experiment.
In district prosecutors if it were a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, representing the defendants on trial for Marihuanadelikte and on the ground as the spokesman for the national organization for reform of Marihuanagesetzen.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives, to prosecute people for that they still cannot accept the legalization," he believes.
The first states that smaller quantities of marijuana, alcohol, Colorado and Washington and national test-cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they also nervously await instructions from the federal government, the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
Advocates of legalization movement will succumb to hope that the Ministry of Justice.
Despite several aufsehenerregender arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states largely.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that law enforcement officials are unlikely to enter doors, in order to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but who are likely to resist the legal under the new legislation, state regulated marijuana to tolerate business.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities act.
Before the election day approved some local municipalities moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although this could open for at least a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, it probably will be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license and then someone at the federal level are facing a major problem," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change in the law.
Later, we opted for what the community and not according to what the state has decided.
There are still many questions unanswered.

Petronella Wyatt from Oxford: I was mobbed, because I am Tory
Not only university students today will be attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream, to be given a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the University, which I once thought for the world's largest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilisation-free thinking and tolerance -.
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College in the late 1980s, I had intended to study history-I had my suitcase and the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said that I would be because I had a problem with that fellow in neighbouring rooms had sex.
The author A N Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I walked away.
Yes, because I was suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because I unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been harassed for one reason only - a reason in this alleged cradle of enlightenment seemed so parochial and cruel: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher and I have been in favor of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right suffers from similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for equal rights protection in the same benefits, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) give the Corpus Christi College, they are often isolated actively, because their political views "personally attacked and declared undesirable."
They are calling for a place in the equality committee of college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Its situation has been exacerbated by a recent ausgestrahlte documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been shown, inter alia graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, in a Rolls-Royce and with silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock protzte.
In other universities say conservative students, they are as "scapegoats" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
The 20-year Luke black, Vice President of the University of Nottingham Association of conservative students, in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing Linkstendenz universities.
The people believe that we as the Bullingdon Club, without met us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant." The 19 years Stephanie Cherill, incoming president of the conservative student association of Oxford says that it has a growing opposition to students in JCR members watched the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was such a minority.
As I was incredibly timid those aged 18 in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
Last year, the university voted in favor, Margaret Thatcher, a former student, due to cuts in higher education to give no official title.
The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.
In the first week of the incoming days, in the new students to get to know each other and the Tutoren, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the Tutoren the mockery of Tory students not only duldeten, but even with joy attended it.
Political issues such as miners strike, the government's privatisation and the rejection of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the holzgetäfelten areas of Tutoriums.
In the first of these events should I French texts translated into English from the 18th century. What should come, I was not taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said Harry Pitt (now the tutor died), "please translate the first paragraph."
I,.
Pitt was a small man with a face as pie pastry and quite invidious.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they simply stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
"I propose that they take a few Französischstunden in your spare time - in other words, if you are not too preoccupied with your social activities," Pitt knurrte me.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
This evening, I sat at the College alone at the dinner, when one easy on the back tippte.
It was a Englischstudent from the second year named James, which is presented as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are friendly," he said.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, harassed.
It is bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher close, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first-year pretend to be supporters of the Labor Party.
In a local Pub later I tried to make me.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs Thatcher was in all respects.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A first-year philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, the conservative current visited Eton College, said to me: `You are the daughter of a fascist schweins."
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dreckig.
"How Tories have sex?" asked me one.
The are each other, or?
I felt as homosexuals before the liberal legislation had to have felt the United States.
I would ever be able to Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would Gleichgesinnte can make only after dark?
I should address the Labor Party and my natural inclination to suppress?
The three years before me, from my intellectual eye gradually become a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who has admitted openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he Thatcher when it comes to foreign policy advice and wrote speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place was him provincial and narrow and turned him for his Marxist deterministische Geschichtsperspektive.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel between Oxford and the House my parents and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed in disbelief.
During his time in the Vierzigern all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
Something they would never do, not in my city of träumenden Tower.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners.
His wet eyes trübten.
Give it a chance.
I am sure that we neckt you only.
It would break my heart if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London my emotional resistance was weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had buckled under pressure and renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, where another Geschichtstutor seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly in shame zerging, I am my parents were subjected to a "brainwashing" and called them "old stupid."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, the final nail in the coffin my Oxford-career.
At the time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hidden in my room, and after five minutes, my Häscher.
When they did, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Can you give me a to weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But not those aged 18 in an educational institution should ever have to suffer such intimidation and spite.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only 14 Tory Prime Minister produced, but up to now hiding behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino, elegance of celebrity '
At the exhibition `Valentino master of Couture, "which opened in London this week, ABC with Naty Abascal, Mrs Thyssen Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, the hosting of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani is worthy.
This, the designer at the opening of "Valentino" master of Couture recognized, a magnificent retrospective, for the more than 130 clothes Haute Couture chosen by its "Maison created over the last 50 years."
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a history, whose sole protagonist `il signore "Garavani, but without his distinguierte clientele cannot be written.
Valentino felt always fascination for the stickige and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be until 3 March, there are a number of private letters and photographs the erlesensten aristocracy, starting with the signature of the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows this personal recollections a trophy of its social rise from modest fashion maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy the idol of international Jetsets.
To be in love with the nobility, must not be at a disadvantage.
"at least they are not their overturned on your beautiful carpet, as do some fine celebrities from the pop music," says Baroness Mrs Thyssen Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We are all pleased when we have been invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the Exfrau of "Heini Thyssen," chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress from Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza charisma of the fashion maker does not forget.
For many years we went into a fashion television the Piazza di Spagna in Rome with him home to dinner.
We were around 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his housing, the decoration, the food and the music and felt his influence to be recognized.
"All guests felt important and loved," remembers the "top model" that their careers in the week of the Haute Couture began in Paris in 1995.
"He is never out of fashion, because its design works of art," she says finally.
Fashion picture of origin
The lives of Garavani is not a history of Versessenheit, instead of mutual love affairs.
He may be people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long bridge, which proposes a role reversal: The user takes the place of the model and the bridge along, is a fantastic "audience" to admire the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress for her wedding with Aristóteles that Jackie Kennedy Onassis chose, the Kostüme Monica Vitti in "La Notte" was, or a veil from wool and leather, the empress Farah Diba.
In this audience from fashion dolls rays names like the Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und taxis, Mette Marit of Norway, Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg Rosario.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these have say, is the first Valentino as the first love, "unforgettable."
I can still remember perfect.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a Western type "Gillette" and a jacket from the Herbst/Winter Kollektion 1971 - 1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the Musen of Designers.
All the other "I prefer him for his great love for women and because it highlights our beauty,," the former Duchess of Feria adds.
I like the colors, which he used that very; they have a great deal of light and stress that point.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the Princess and Meinungsführende in the fashion Patricia Della Giovampaola d `Arenberg, cannot forget the first time a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy, I dreamed of as a teenager, finally the age and the opportunity to one of its evening kleider...
It eventually came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a festival in the castle of my Vetters, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a drapierten with a Dekolleté that makes his name honor.
"It was a true a dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d `Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," explained the Italian Aristokratin between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D `Arenberg preserved their evening kleider of the fashion maker "with utmost care" to "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the memories associated with it."
The "king" of fashion
The big finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding gown by Marie Chantal Miller on their wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his Näherinnen) were required to this elfenbeinfarbene silk gown with pearls, 12 different embroidery and a half metres Schweif produce.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture the end of the 20th century, "a return to the Kundinnen top society."
For years with the "savoir" être marred the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy), the highest award Cavaliere del lavoro, Commandeur de L `ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded Garavani added of the Order of the Legion of Honour, so many honors, as each of the husbands its Kundinnen.
"I always for its sophistication, its quiet, and perfect appearance is struck D `Arenberg."
I have him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table Gräfin Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.

And that says a Princess...

The most difficult job in the world: The human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euro, the winner of the Indonesian volcano risking their lives and health when they 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is the hell, and other work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mines workers who earn their living by they sulphur from the volcanic Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has every day to his Kraters down on the ground, where the rise out of the ground ausströmende schwefelhaltige gas in contact with air strengthened.
After he has extracted large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, transported it in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope paths of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, to a level of 2386 metres, but the exhausted agencies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the rate of turtles, and they have to be careful in their actions and keep the balance, so that they do not slip and fall.
You know that each step can cost as much as their lives, as happened to a French tourist who years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which they.
Top arrived, they pave the path between the tourists who they as circus affen photographs and run with the tedious serious baskets three kilometres to balance a mining company a little further down a total of 1850 metres set
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcanic and (never better) exploiting its workers, which they said 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilogram of sulphur.
For every 10,000 rupees (it sold 83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life, and for the manufacture of matches next fireworks products, cosmetics, Dynamit and even the bleaching of sugar is used.
"because we usually perform 70 kg, for every way we receive approximately EUR 46.000 rupees (3.8), Anto tells us," the normally three routes on the day.
It needs three hours for each route that he completely succeeded, at the end of the day he has but then 138.000 rupees (11.5).
What a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but the times of what he deserves to be with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest paid $15,000 rupees (1.2) a day, and the average monthly income is $2 million rupees (167), is very high," explained the winner who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
He earned $75,000 rupees (6.2) day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family returned after Banyuwangi, a village near the in Indonesia, and for a reason that is as important as the sulphur: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought it to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs and his eyes are often because of the toxic gases gereizt.
The 27 year-old Anto, after three years of his life on Kawah Ijen at risk, whose sulphur at him, even though he has already taken the first traces with a face mask and Spezialbrille covers.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs and his eyes are often because of the toxic gases from the volcanic gereizt.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here for another two years, because I open a shop or Spanish or French wants to learn," he promises in a more acceptable than English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but the life gestrafte young man could as tourist guides, waiters or work on the reception of the hotel, but instead he carried out the work of Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other agencies and is at two o'clock every morning because the sulphur will ausströmt at night, where his distinctive yellow color in the darkness bläulich shine.
The shadow challenging, he rises in the light up a small lamp in his helmet he has bought by his own money in the crater.
Some 400 winner shop on the crater bed the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite its huge profits, the mining company reduction in the sulphur not mechanized, in order to save costs, and provides the agencies working on their own account and paid by weight, no equipment.
They also get a share of the $30,000 rupees (2.5) award per photo apparatus, the Guardian this national parks, together with the entrance fee of EUR 15,000 rupees (1.2) by the tourist demand, the photography of the volcano and human Tragesel.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protested Madrusin, a stämmiger, 42 years old agencies, the three decades since leaving school on Kawah Ijen works.
He is in a position to take up to 110 kg and assurances that he continues, "As long as it is," he because the money for raising his three children aged between 10 and 18 years needs.
I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my life.
Even if the sulphur his throat burns the eyes itch, and if the wind suddenly and mine workers in the thick pillars einklemmt, the move from the crater, the men are so hard that nobody complains about serious diseases... of course alongside the normal breathing problems result, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, the by the weight of the baskets have distorted.
With the basket on his back is merely Unainik with its 53 years in the situation, 50 kg.
Every day break he and his associates 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano in three trucks on a goat path between the Gebüsch to camp in Tamansari transported in 18 kilometres away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because of the volcanic my whole life" was declared Unainik, when he opens his mouth wide, where some teeth missing.
The grandfather of his five children works with his 30 years as sulphur winner.
As time passes, but the poverty generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: Those who as human burden esel on Kawah Ijen work.

Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapurer people lay the blame for the fact that they have no children, career, the stress and the cost of housing and child rearing.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viralen video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a song, the local Rapper slogans such as "pushing a" Bao " (loaf) in the kiln, about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which has made the video, preserves the hope that the advert in an entertaining way, to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to meet their "national duty."
This is something only on the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The equipment we are the worst in the world, so we remarked that this is an issue that we have to look.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of Speed dating agencies evenings (rapid Flirts).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success.
Therefore we thought: Why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap to komponieren?
1.2 children
If this issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore.
Each year, they are $1,300 for political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, hochtechnologischer city state in the southeast Asia, including for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known.
According to its national population authority is the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was more than 2, which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't get the Singapurer more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director of the national population authority for marriage and family policy, says that this is the result of a "better education" and " `major career prospects.
"This has allowed the people, except to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she said.
These changes in the social realities have higher number of single and helped delay marriage and birth, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a surge in Zuwanderungen to counteract the reduction of the population to resentment in the local population.
There are websites in Singapore, where the little kaschierte xenophobia against many new immigrants is, especially against the Chinese who criticised that they keep wages low and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem of higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers to correct.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the repercussions on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are being built.
It has already impact on the housing market.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small Appartements, are known as the "shoe boxes" and must be built in certain areas of the city.
These Appartements have a Wohnfläche of 46 square meters and show a large sales success.
But the concern is that they can promote the lifestyle of a single person, and that they will deter construction companies to build large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" much faster than bigger houses sell.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
The result is that they are very much better for our cash flow.
He is, however, that the new standards developers clearer guidelines, which previously placed obstacles in the way that they too many small units within a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore, a city state.
Even if these new rules pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate could, the talks with the Singapurern, from working in the financial quarter, that they will not have a major impact.
"people are very stressed, the housing and education are expensive, so it is delayed by many people," says a young managers.
The children can get.
"it is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.
Men and women their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and education as reasons that they cannot have children.
This is why the Singapurer have the last word, when it comes to have children, because the government can still do so much.

The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the private or "those area of privacy, where people are entitled to protection against any kind of interference."
What is privately for anyone under the age of 16?
How will this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
He understands the dangers that it is suspended when he known situations on the Internet, which he would not share in real life?
EL Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years, which are often on the Net.
In four of the cases they linked the concept with "something very own on a personal level" and "the password and user," if it on social networks.
"My deepest secrets I would not announce in a postal" the 10-year-old Jorge says in an attempt, the meaning of "private" in Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live messenger to explain where he accounts for two years.
"It is highly confidential secrets, my mother must know it, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On FB I invite beautiful pictures or images of games.
I vertreibe also my time with friends.
"I would not photograph share, this is not me, or from someone who's stupid," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked, crime, or insulting or violent to write comments.
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has in FB and nine Folger in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother, the password to one of the accounts.
I reported on Twitter to express myself and interesting to write tweets.
"I do not know if someone says, I invite them only high," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends, it."
Asked he says that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown man.
Even if a tourist empfähle him, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask are unaware of it, 20 of the people, which he has attached his friends list.
"I am not shocked, because we have something in common, for example, music," he is.
The boys said that he has made no comments or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"When somebody harassed me or they demanded of me, I entferne him simply by my user account it is."
José appeared in Ask, after he had read a recommendation on Twitter.
The boys are not unknown experience, which is known today as Cyberbullying.
The friend of a friend, a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victims of the user account not closed.
"He has made it only privately."
He then outlined a series of steps, in order to guarantee a user account konfigurieren.
Unlike Jorge would this boy photos of friends in awkward or embarrassing situations hochladen.
Yes, I would do that, if he is unsympathetic me or I want him one judging.
"But I know that this Cyberbullying," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with degrees in education and learning, says that about the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"the Internet as a medium for the search for information; with the publication of these sides, but the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a master title in teaching at Yale University and author of the plant "Digital Natives and immigrant" these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives they are, children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants, they are supposed to teach, when we even learn," he says.
He says that it is a complex issue, "because we demand that they have a defined criterion of what, can be published or said, in an age where the maturity of this is not enough."
"They will also be wählerisch, if it is most important for them to be popular, thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions, which gives them pause for thought.
"to tell you that they should not do it, does not work," he says.
Porras calls then some possibilities: There are things you not tell strangers würdest. Why you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would like it if we published a photograph of you, such as the one that you have published by a friend?
Do you know what the other on you publish?
You have asked for permission from the others before, if you have labeled photographs of celebration?
And one more question: All need to know what you at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline.
It is the same rules.
"someone outside of the Internet, with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, Grundschullehrer and educational consultants, it commented on that essential that parents carefully the directives of the social networks.
If you all understand sections, they have solid foundations to deal with their children about the importance of Eröffnens one user accounts on the Internet.
"age, for example, or what we share or publish," he says.
According to the Civil, the children of the lesson "thou shalt not speak to strangers' .

Conclusion of the summit of Unasur without publishing the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publishing the Lima Declaration, which had previously announced and in theory the rulers of the seven should be signed.
Efe repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the sixth ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the Heads of State and President firm initially told that they were handed over after the closing, according to some time later, however, that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
When it comes to the text, they said that the content by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day in the press room only the image of the president meeting without tone with the word "private meeting limited Audio".
The few information among journalists, blaring, the press some of the governments of the Unasur present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press secretary.
The only document that during the day, the list of participating president, which was in the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media provoked unease, calling for more information.
Then from the presidency of Peru the media an e-mail with the "final" of the summit, but was Humala's statement and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru was hosting the Third Summit South America-Arab states (ASPA), and also on this occasion, despite strong calls by the press the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously announced, nor published.
On the official website of the ASPA we can convince that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meeting stressed the Peruvian authorities that would have been the information systems for journalists, but in a highly limited access to the information.
The summit ended with a shared commitment of Chile and Peru, a ruling by the Court of Justice in The Hague that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima against Santiago began to listen to the pleas on both sides.
"We will judge the differences that we are currently follow this international court, and carry out," said Humala along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and remains a country that adheres to the international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and the international courts," adds Piñera and grüßte Humala with a hands pressure from the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both President that they would be subject to the ICJ, was abandoned after Colombia after a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, the thought that it was a serious mistake, had brought against the agreement of Bogota, what it agreed to abide by the rulings of the International Court of Justice.
Present at the summit were the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, the for 2011 after the removal of President Fernando Lugo is excluded from the Unasur, attended the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala, the talks opened this morning and ended the summit shortly after midday in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, which said that 16 decisions and the courses for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment amount totaling roughly $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship will do what we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "cooperation in the fight against the insecurity in the cities and organized, transnational crimes to improve, as well as measures to access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices to improve in all areas of South America and in the event of natural disasters to act together and effectively."
With the crisis in Europe must "economic consolidation (in Latin America) does not accept triumphant trains, but is designed to increase our output and a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided, to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects, the space links in South America and especially in rural and border areas designed to improve... and therefore our countries unite and open up new type of business," said the Peruvian President in a statement read.
Under these projects would be five Peruvian on the Querachsen his area of the coast to Brazil, and which two to create a better link with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
Also took the final terms of the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country for reinstatement in the Union South American nations," is excluded from the moment.
The need for Latin America continue to an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect that emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that he in Mexico on Saturday a meeting with his counterparts of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to the maritime conflict after a ruling by the ICJ of Bogotá in question to be treated respectfully.
"I may be tomorrow (Saturday) meeting with the President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.

"I hope the President Ortega to say that we will deal with this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they have the intention to the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto to attend.
As part of the summit, also in the run-up to the bloc's defense ministers met the adoption of the action plan for the 2013, what the dialogue and consensus on the defense of the region should be strengthened.

"South America must learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, and "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, on 6 summit attended by the president of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that took place in Lima, the Peruvian state television said that the Europeans were killing "in the Second World War and other conflicts" and "today are practically a homeland."
With this in mind, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which promote the Unasur's member states.
"must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as has been the case in the Andean Community ist;es are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who signed the agreement of San José on human rights.
Those who teach, never commit themselves to something, and in return, we are signing the South Americans all the time.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is funded by the United States," he told as a reference to the political asylum in Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted.
Correa asserted that he does not regret the decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views about human rights," has fulfilled.
He added that it was "justified suspicions had been handed over to a third country that Assange and his trial would not complied with."
It also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which requires him on its territory him undergo interrogation because of alleged Sexualdelikts, while "the Swedish legislation allows it via a video conference, the had Ecuador in London on the message can be carried out."
Correa said that the danger that would undermine the health and mental state of Assange.
"since it is in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has, however, informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the head of state Ecuador.
, there is a risk that he took physical and psychological damage, because he was trapped in a narrow space and cannot conduct physical exercises outdoors.
"that would be detrimental to the health of everyone," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum that Assange in London for the month of June in Ecuador's message was granted to the granting of a Freibriefs, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the judicial authorities would be Europe's. He stressed that there had been talks with London, in order to find a solution to the captive founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with the human rights, that we do not apply in this case, however, there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the judicial authorities Europe because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, a set of procedures in various European bodies," he said.
And "if Britain morning this licence granted, I believe that this is done."
And if Sweden Mr Assange on the message Ecuador in London or on Skype verhörte, as the Swedish law allows and in other cases, the problem will be done.
Correa took the opportunity to portray himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity that bad faith and weaken the lie that freedom of expression."
"the greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who after profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense that he congratulated Ecuador no longer of such journalists "and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries," he and I think in a re-election "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision, the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur maintain at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism must remain "hard and no opportunism and should never grant verkleideten coup to be legal," because it "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of Ecuador is also the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua bevorteilte seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, with Nicaragua to negotiate for "absolutely justified."
This judgment is not implemented at the moment.
It is a problem between a South and Central American nation.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the quest for a common path.
They must be comprehensively so that they can be overcome and look forward.
He also familiar to a successful conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court and said that "it is right for Latin America, international bodies to oblige, if both countries to adopt the ruling, even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he is as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he admitted that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it sometimes very difficult."
Correa promised that if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from the political life.
Power has never interested me personally but in unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who this likely victory guaranteed, so I have this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I retreat from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had visited South Africa, planned for a routine treatment, and that would expected that he could go back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It is in no way a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader, today in Lima on 6 summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to a sustainable progress, equality and security.

Cause of a dying of AIDS is today a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the outcome of the inquiry, confirmed HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says on the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."
He hid it in his family.
He decided to look just about his illness and started to inform; and this with such use that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of unity of the HIV Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) live for 22 years, was at the beginning of the 1990s, when it was hard to imagine many doubts, stigma was a few treatment and more.
Then it avoided even the director of the IMSS to a clinic, "because it into a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people are still in the clinic who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already damage and their immune system has run out of steam, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the publication of AIDS in the world. In other words, the date of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient's treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information in April this year was supported by a respected scientific publication.
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life on the level of damage to the immune system of people at the start of treatment law, and that the greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years in a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that, who at the age of 25, the diagnosis is HIV positive, "can be easily 75 years old in this sense, as long as it is under control," the expert said.
In order to be able to view this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality has significantly reduced in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (reduced annual report ONUSIDA)), it is true that since the appearance of the AIDS 60% of patients covered by the national database died.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until May this year are already 187 deaths, however, said that it is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why so people still die?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no problems of drug supply. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they are unaware of their infection status, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a resounding statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us if they have already an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, and all persons, where necessary, massive screening tests must be provided."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients as Fabrizio, which has carried out its test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS stage and even the Kaposi Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we want to hear nothing.
"If I was going to die, then burst," says one to three times in my case.
The amendment was to improve, I ernähre me well, treibe sport and take the drugs.
Today his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life as anyone else.
"I have a lot of work, it does, an active, but responsible Sexleben, I am on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio, which agreed to include his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco to share with his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global AIDS day afraid.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner we know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they will learn how to as all people can live responsibly.
The news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizen big holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which adopted the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the certain places "was the distribution of condoms; previously, they were actually increased individually, now give us with a hundred little packages, which already is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
One of the risk for new infections among young people.
"Why do you need?" is a widespread Spottfrage of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to suspend assured the correspondent.
He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in issuing equipment in public toilet facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted the promiscuity.
They are not paid the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether under his administration would be distributed condoms.
"sexuality is not enough; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it more succinctly.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is seen nationally in fourth place new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13 in terms of HIV.
92% of Ansteckungsfälle takes place through sex, 6% on the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are registered for each case 4 or 5 people who do not know.

After the Court of Appeal confirmed the judgment of the United States, which does not recognize the group's debt restructuring Vitro that has been achieved on a trade konkurs in Mexico, will be a more sinister precedent for each national companies with operations in the neighbouring country has created the payment problems.
You could say that the procedures for survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition by the judge's ruling handed down on 15 June Harlin Hale on court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas that Mexican companies to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river bravo helpless.
But the decision opens the door to largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, for three inconsistencies to the Supreme Court of the United States.
While pointing out that the judges creditors the Bankruptcy Law must be subject to the United States, says the Appeal of the Fifth circuit based in New Orleans, first of all, that the main proceedings in the trade konkurs dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for corporate default with länderübergreifendem profile is unknown.
Indeed, the United Nations to this end, the model law for the unification of the international trade law and the American Law Institute, was used as a arbitrators.
Secondly, the ruling stipulates that without the voices of societies to recognize the liabilities in the estate, the branches of Vitro with its parent company, did not have the necessary majority to restructure the debt would have been reached.
But this is the possibility of the Mexican laws recognized.
Indeed, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme.
There are a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities under the group companies from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for trade bankruptcies) confirmed.
It is also true that after deducting the votes of the branches of Vitro creditors, creditors in the courts of the United States against Vitro complained, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had reached a majority.
The vote would be 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into consideration by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, there are Vitro blame for his difficult situation from 2008 during the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country hits.
That is why the Gonzalez Sada family before the same Court of Appeal contradiction to the vote in plenary, i.e. from all judges voted, because only three of them.
It is not granted, the Cerciorare-appeal, calling for a review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Schwerwiegende in this case is that the court has set aside a document by the Mexican government under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), what the procedure carried out by Vitro within the framework of the law on trade described bankruptcies, and what it is pointed out that it must adhere strictly to the agreements signed between the two countries had kept the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law to comply with the United States.
The country will also pointed out that the principles of the United Nations Commission on the subject to international trade, i.e. the rules laid down in cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Zweibandige Karambole: A blow to Vitro and for the country.
Overall record
After the complaints by the Mexican trade unions for air against the former owners Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, the accused of fraudulent management, not forward came several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (union of pilots) finally made progress.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life '
The Weltenbummler of Basketballs, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was the basket sport for more than 60 years and has visited the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of history of the country's Basketballs as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was killed by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair was Rexes 6 years, either as part of this sport players lower classes, players in the first National League, and director's agent in BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My life I went to the basketball, even several put many hats at the same time, when I President of BSN, CEO and President of the Association was in the 1990s," remembered Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all with photographs and memories of his long career decorated and they show.
Bayamón at the heart
The emotionalsten memories are those who are skeptical about his time in the middle of the 1950s Vaqueros as players until 1982, where his 15-year anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or directors of the club celebrated.
"These were my best years I have enjoyed most, because I was part of the Vaqueros eight championships since 1967 it as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach privilege.
There were many rewarding years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted a championship in 1981, the year of Debüts of Jerome Mincy in BSN.
From then took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good managers, "Reyes says.
I remember that I worked as coach Gene Bartow here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m major players.
Möchtest you him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow, then the Freiwurf specialists Raymond Gausse, en masse, and was one of our best Werfer.
I remember, as he said that, if Mincy facilitated a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another would provide.
The championship the Vaqueros with Gausse he was granted, but from a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At the time he preferred his enforcement and Mincy to enjoy in the national team.
I remember when we first won at the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, the fourth place where we should have been documented what bronze, if not this Canadian referee would have been the last us Spielzug repeated for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won 2004 against the dream team at the Olympics.
But my favorite is the team the Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we gold in 1991, and the US team won a fight, as when they won bronze at the World Cup against us.
In the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas López, Fico and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also included the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, León (Francisco brothers and Edgar) and Mario Morales, the 1990 "Quixote" could not be because of a knee injury.
A team that perhaps in terms of figures was not the best, but with which we won a gold medal and the us great pleasure, those of was paved vorolympischen Turniers Neuquén, Argentina in 1995.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner schedule as a substitute for players because of the events in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all forecast.
Who was the best players of Puerto Rico?
This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
Its figures at international level tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated as Piculín at this level.
And that, without taking account of his career in the different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
As we had a number of good trainer Julio Toro, `Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys like the work of Leo Arill well.
What glaubst you is the best thing that you have achieved in the Association?
I was part of the team's most successful era between 1988 and 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams involved in a season.
What remains to be done you?
There are things that I have introduced, such as the regionalisation of lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play on their territory and only in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children many unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the result of mandatory training and courses for trainers, table, officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you today?
I listen to music, see my time in YouTube videos of music, enjoy my grandchildren, and I am going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the society my wife Isabel, who has always been on my side.

The start of the course, which studied the "end of the world,"
Every week, the students apocalyptic examining issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Each semester, if the religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: "the end of the long Rückwärtszählung" of the Mayan calendar on 21 December, of which many people believed that this means the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what should await him in the following two months: The destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon' , as well as a growing conflict between Israel's participation, the place where the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester that ever existed," Charmé said this week the students at Rutgers University, Camden (New Jersey).
If someone, analyzed what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, it would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And it is not the only professor who this semester, which is supposed to be the last in the history, offers courses on the "end of the world."
In Temple, the beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, the students apocalyptic examining issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear materials into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and studied how they compare compared with real life.
"I have tried to inform the students, which is possible, probably, credible and it is impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a beisitzende professor of art history and anthropology formed a team to settle a course with the name "The End of the World" offer.
"We are not in 2012, so that we always keep the option, newly able to hold back on an even keel, in the event that the world does not sink," said Restall.
Despite the "impending doom" must prepare the students study projects and participate in audits.
At Penn State, the audit carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, why the students have no other option than to continue "until the night when the world comes to an end," said Restall said.
Prices were very popular.
"in two hours" Restall said there was no seats on its course for students with high average, with 35 students filled.
For weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mails from students who asked whether still places are available.
For its part, the students say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is exciting to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects-or religion mentality is really just a question of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa of psychology and health care, all apocalyptic films I have ever seen.
"I have never heard of a teaching, where it will be informed," he admitted.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed, and even less a professor, to believe in the last date of December 21.
"our first project looked at the prophecy of the Maya, and in certain ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya said never ahead of the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He, however, notes that in the western society is an apocalyptic fear that several centuries back, when the people to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world responded.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"elsewhere, people do not think so," he says.
This is particularly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, which this year in the Philippines, quickly respond to the question of whether he is a course on the "end of the world would know."
"The Philippines are not at the end of the world," he wrote on an exception to suggest a higher court.
We have a pardon by the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days last court, and said that if nothing happens, on 21 December "immediately to a new date" or are thinking about philosophierten that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period that would be the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date easily.
To celebrate several said that they wish to go on "the end of the world."
"Perhaps I call on a few friends so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year student for communications.
