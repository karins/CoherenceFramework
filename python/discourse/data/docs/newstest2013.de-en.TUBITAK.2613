A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center, the latter is a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers, the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the United States for the conduct of the elections in the individual States.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedures for the registration and the ballot.
This phenomenon has after the elections in November 2010 in importance where 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States could be recorded.
As a result, 180 bills introduced in 2011, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.
The new election laws require that the voters a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also periods for the early vote, the right declared invalid, on election day to register as voters and citizens the right to vote, for which a court acts.
Before the elections of 2006, a state of the electorate requires a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008, the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to this practice should be extended to other States.
Over the last two years, they encouraged in 34 States draft legislation with which the voters will have a photo ID.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identity card as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, in other words, 21 million voters people not by a government authority of their state issued photo ID.
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012, does not have such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay for the required ID.
Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo ID.
This is further.
The students who are regarded as voters their voice more for Democratic candidates, it is not allowed in several States, from its establishment issued photo identification to use.
On the other hand, members of the same States allow Angel- or hunting clubs that are more on the Republican side to choose which of these associations issued cards for elections.
In 2004, a federal state for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state that such a request.
In 2011, a dozen States have passed legislation that voters are demanding that their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters, the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators in eight States laws in 2011, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups, to offer help to those voters who would like to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the general elections in 2004, approximately 10 million citizens to register.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 to 17%.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other States adopted laws aimed at the period for the early vote.
For example, were in the general elections in 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they only 13% of voters in the state.
The same is true for the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of people who have chosen in advance.
By contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been affected by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
You were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States adopted laws that require photo identification showing.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012, no doubt, the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws passed by and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the crucial States for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes, the electoral college are needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.

Prostate cancer screening: if the test should be made or not?
In fact, the PSA-Test sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater reluctance of already undecided men for the implementation of Früherkennungstests.
The test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies conducted in the United States were many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without screening.
This study has also shown that a observation after 12 years, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30% to 40% higher if no screening was conducted.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when a direct relatives, who has been ill with prostate cancer.
In men African American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as a cancer was detected.
There are cancers, the aggressive and others, where the Indo-European.
The patients, the extent of the risk of cancer is made clear by the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate Tata crab, if it is the quality of life in the long term is not affected, and in these cases is more of an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many of the men, where cancer has recognised, no treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and not a threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
It certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who does not.
I therefore recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.
The most important thing is, however, to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international society for Urology as Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible that the pros and cons of the widespread PSA testing.

The disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all good enough to eat and move.
"If there is no smoking, it would be at least a 50% increase," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unresolved.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
You seem to be the risk of breast, fierce appendix, fattening appendix, Speiseröhren, Bauchspeicheldrüsen and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against fierce colorectal cancer," he added.
The diet
The organisation also recommends that the consumption of red meat.
In great quantities, it increases the risk of wrath or fattening of developing colorectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins.
In recent years, several scientists, the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their investigations, however, is not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
While a study to reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, showed another rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family to talk about the long-term degradation.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."

The Higgs particle boson analysed
The announcement of the probable discovery of Higgs-Bosons last summer, has a certain sensation, and for good reason.
It does, in fact, that this Boson to nothing less than the mechanism is involved in the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And, finally, is the last particle whose existence from the standard model, our best or least wrong explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but still not empirically observed.
But for the physicist, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the Higgs particle predicted by the Standard Model boson strong.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data this week on a major physics conference in Kyoto were presented, but there are still no data, to be completely safe.
We are still working on the assumption that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk to deceive, and we are looking at what is at stake.
There are in this world will inevitably be inescapable law, which means that two objects not in the same place at the same time, there can be.
It is not possible to go against this rule, and try not to, because you are hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they, too, such a law, "the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles do not have the same space occupied at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state", the "state" by and large, from some of their properties.
On this basis, the particle physicists share in two categories.
In one corner are good citizens, who are referred to as Fermione and suddenly the rotational poles.
And in the other move all, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that they are, in fact, at the same time, in the same place.
These all are made according to the website The delta Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Greek barys, meaning "we will not deal with the "power particles," by which the great forces of nature and spread the Higgs particle boson somehow would be used.
It must be emphasised, however, that not all of these all such exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this history, it was only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the Q-switching or the "light particles," the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electrical charge is accelerating or change the direction, the electromagnetic field exactly in this place "disrupted", such as a pebble in a pond was thrown.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the all "winner of the force."
More stable field
The same is true for the Higgs particle boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs particle field, "disrupted" must be to ensure that this Boson shows.
However, the Higgs particle field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has very high energy, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks could be addition.
This is a huge particle accelerator as CERN needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a total of 27 km - in order to achieve this kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again, the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all of the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, a piece of paper would never even in the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs particle field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the Q-switching) have no mass.
For what can all these research now "good" asked Mrs Plamondon?
For the science they serve the revision of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all deviations between the observations and predictions of SM to investigate.
There are also many physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference a door to a "new physics" and open some holes of the model could fill.
It must be said that the latter has serious shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which account for around 80% of the subject matter of the universe (retabling ups!).
However, the CERN such deviations until now not been found.
Effects of
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories was not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
You saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the film itself, the first permanent TBarCode laser (were the first continuous) has already said that the laser at the beginning rather than a "laboratory she" has been seen.
Imagine....
In addition, applications from all the instruments, the research.
For example, has, in turn, Willard Boyle 1969 during his work on a small light sensor.
Although it is not the original purpose was to serve this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and gave him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you can never really know.

Palliative care - the best way to die... Le Devoir published
With its Committee on "death with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, in this important area is still much to do.
The Devoir published has tried to look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the panoramic monté.
The prostate cancer, the aufzehrte him, he had a period of two years.
"You gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the day before.
"However, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: a vast weakness prevents him, only to go to the toilet and even to eat.
The table in front of a tasty lunch sitting, he resigned itself to help with the meal.
Brave it even to smile and to talk with strangers, which employs around him, his medication, and a bathroom.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea heals, since this is humiliating," he agrees.
A few hours later, the team has a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man on foot pinkelt," says Pierre three Victor-Gadbois psychologist in the home.
In the childhood phase is for some people to return to an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person", a step backwards, he notes.
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, major events in the midst of this regression.
The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois instructed, are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are the doctors and nurses who care for them, no longer with so-called "healing" care fare.
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, "deliberately and suffocation" to die.
But the disease, I have really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no wishes more in life," she says, before they accepted that it is a mask, which helps her to breathe.
You expected in the next few days, a recent visit to her son, who is from Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the food.
The palliative care will be used, if there are no other options.
The death more enjoyable.
In Quebec, state residents on a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little, if you consider that one day we will all die.
This is life in the best possible conditions continue, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the homes.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying, according to request an oral care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics must have their blood sugar levels no longer control.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we have Mr X a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son the beer glasses at the feet of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
The home Victor-Gadbois is not a day as the others.
In addition to an old man from 93 years ago, the last family Rally in the courtyard and well supported by his pillow while in opening up a young man dies from 36 years ago by his parents, his wife and two small children surrounded, tragically, he has tried everything in order to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years proves," Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with.
53% of patients admitted to the home Victor-Gadbois come from their abode, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And a number of organisations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
These very serious shortcoming in the healthcare Quebec's ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors of the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent personalities of palliative care as Dr States Waulo and Dr. Bernard lapo mãos signed to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec's the health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that all of the right to a high-quality palliative care before they accepted on euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room was, without the mitigating measures taken.
I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions stubbornly until the last day.
The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, as it has broken as a result of chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin, that I will stop the treatment, they replied that they regret that I have given up the fight, told them.
However, she had told me that I was at the end.
No OmniStrip strong care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nurses, that it will not, after their pain by a team of palliative care have been eased.
But it must be clearly stated that the palliative care in the treatment of pain is not OmniStrip potent.
After an Monereau, director of the palliative care of society, the home of the Greater Montreal palliative care about 8% of patients not on a pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors are so often on the back of sedation, which amounts to the patients either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death einzuschläfern.
We can no longer pretend that we have this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to this of sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviate, all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want you to euthanise", but "I want my pain will be eased."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalism went Canadian health research institutes.

Real estate scandals large scale in Quebec
Officials of the road-building £30,000, companies of Bauhauptgewerbe, fundraisers, political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day, as they have a great "system" in the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso are enmeshed.
An "industry", for the taxpayer Quebec's was very expensive, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures," witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, Sjöstedt in Quebec and a former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal has given him a thorough investigation of the embezzlement in connection with the treaties to road day.TV uncovered in Quebec, the former prime minister had only reluctantly agreed.
The "Duchesneau-Bericht" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "the Ministry of Transport had a billion dollars to save the treaties," because some zügelten her instinct, in order to get their share.
The charbonneau commission "has already had two mayors to", he added, in the hope that it can "to identify the individuals behind the tactics."
Launched a 2011, the permanent anti-corruption
Launched in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption is doing with their troops to auditors, find and analysts of the government is also a great effort.
The police officers "marteau force", which since 2009 has ensured that the "sewer cartel" of Montreal in the artificial inflation of the treaties is more circumspect.
In recent weeks, it has a series of house searches and accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just returned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec, the third largest city, has resigned.
He is suspected of repeatedly in exchange for public contracts to have taken bribes.
Specifically, engineers have been accused of road-building Office of Montreal, and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has sensation by the Commission, the operation of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He has several years of 3% of the value of the contracts in Montreal to one with the mafia intermediaries paid the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito, everywhere in the 2000s had his hand in the game by more than 88.000 Canadian Dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberal landslide in power at the time.
He also confessed to an illegal fundraising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau organized.
Sewer contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption smoothly.
The former engineer Gilles surprenant has described in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes to the tune of $736.000 in return for sewer contracts, which cost it artificially inflated.
Other officials of the road-building £30,000 have admitted that they gave you pay off the bills with false benefits ɬ aufblähten about 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay accused that he deliberately on a shadow budget has overlooked its coffers filled with black money.
As a result of these revelations is Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm.
As mayor of the city district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, they declined from 2010, against the sale of municipal land on that for $5 million and acquired for $1.6 million to developers in the booming housing market has been sold.
70% of black money in election campaigns
The investigation will be carried out at the end of the day, she says that she "on a thread, which allows the operation of ants well-documented system to understand in order to stop the evil and denounce the culprits."
She said that the procedure "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but one need only to Montreal certain investigative unit, as well as a supervisor for a return of the questionable practices.
How clean.
, regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau seinerseits notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "officials who are aware of the tactics" if they are not involved in the fraud.
Based on a percentage of 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec witzelt it: "I have been told that this is a poor substitute for the truth."
The Quebec government is proposing that the donations to parties at $100, which according to him, nothing would change in the situation: "As long as the campaign spending not be strictly limited, black money in politics in circulation."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the awarding of public contracts and the financing of political parties: "We cannot fall deeper; when we get to the bottom with courage, we can house on a sounder basis with more controls and laws."
If this story's international reputation and that of Montreal Quebec's damages, calls for Mr Duchesneau those who laugh a look in their own backyard to throw...

"Match is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have to match a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
You can through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the match.
Great players are.
Every day I am on their side.
The technical staff has also given a lot to me.
These elements spur me on a daily basis, to improve my level of play.
And in a game, it is even easier.
In football, everything is very quickly.
But I must stop not in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of inf directory Clairefontaine features an up to my playing time in Saint-Etienne, I have always gradual progress.
You have the advantage of Carlo Ancelotti introduced competition...
The new entrants this summer are accustomed to games very high level.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me who have to stand up and give his best.
Carlo Ancelotti, gives me a lot in terms of my game.
He will be supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I am.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the match?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon are the place of the finishers.
But we are in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League, we have in this way, for the quarter finals.
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we are against very good European teams we have something to say about it.
First of all, we want to be first in our group in Porto, so that we have the return match in the event that Celtic can compete as a home game.
Can the match in the short term, a big European club?
He has already the budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris title win and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the match the resources so that this project taking shape.
It would be a great failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to win, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really dear to cream off this title.
In the last season, we were close.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough for the victory.
We have the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be master with 79 points.
But a different team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have got what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the match?
In light of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept that completely.
If, however, we are in a home game against Troyes midfielder win, and it still is something you can accuse us of, this is certainly a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win every weekend with midfielder.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, fails to qualify for the quarter finals, and also has made huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed to break with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who last season were not good, this new match "geboostet".
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we in the month of May will be smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The match seems entirely by the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that of a "Zlatan-Abhängigkeit".
This means that Pellegrini is really powerful and many goals.
That is why he has come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respected the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows all the others to make progress.
As you have the Euro 2012 with the French national team experience?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented some game time.
I have seen things there, which I am stronger.
Today, I am, good games in the national team.
Since this was my baptism with the Bleus my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learnt our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strictly, is close to the players and to victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to no comparison.

Everyone has for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never been a similar game in my career.

With Bitcoin is possible without bank payment and selling
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision tangible: the belief that the current banking monopolies and monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, is that of Satoshi Nakasone ’ s (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.), as well as convertible a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network have already been around 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, with a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros), he fell five months later to 2 dollars today before he recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly shine in comparison to the global trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown here.
You Bitcoin describes as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to traditional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to make headway in a video game, you win games or buy (and sometimes to share).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed such a system.
But every time the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin network nodes are all at the same time, repositories of the Court, auditors, ATM issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Any transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address, which the anonymity.
A number of associated with this transaction data will electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way can the network the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the entire network of widespread accounting book of public accounts are available.
The crucial step is that this new transaction in this book.
This is happening on a mathematical task, which is run on computers, with the winner, a kind of provisional central bankier that privilege, this additional line to add.
It is a Zerstückeln the file, in other words, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer "are" the new transaction and add a number, before the whole thing "non-straighted".
The goal is to find one number, which is a unique fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this figure was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is permanently with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay, would be only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains without a link, because they have different fingerprints.
The computer, the task has been resolved, gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will reward regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre.
In addition, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, have been attacked and the Bitcoin-Einlagen stolen.
"The weakness is not the real record," says Pierre Noizat just Paymium has introduced a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, they will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from weizmann Institute in Israel and the accounting book analyses showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins not circulating.
In November, a "file final sales".
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," rejoiceth Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul that Bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses but Bitcoin for validation of the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holders of its identity and therefore can remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented with the traders, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply need to enter an address by a telephone "photographed and identified", Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend, the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems designed to be rethought.
"It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, by the way, the various risks today as a highly respected in the event of a success to revalue its currency.

We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army to take possession of their territory again, and that the Afghan people to decide their future, without all of us to expect.
In particular, we have the Afghan farmers punished, as we have seen them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers who have been killed and injured and crippled.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets.
You want their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there, if the Western countries to be discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, one with almond trees hills have observed, the French was financed through loans, was carried out properly.
The helicopters below lorry and armoured convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, it will not receive more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
Kabul was empty and the country because of the struggles of the various inflammatory groups from the war.
Their power was as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have the price for the obscurantism of the organisation al-Qaeda overthrew farmers paid, but their situation has not improved.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and Taliban have a common desire, the women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war are again came to power in 2001.
You have in this racket, property confiscated by the government, as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell, and thus benefit from the massive American subcontracting.
You have been discredited, and most of them were not even take part in the fighting.
As I have heard it in the campaign, people want a government that is not from thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, such as those who take advantage of the American contributions: capital flight is considerable.
The young people are sick of the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran and Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools full of girls and boys.
These young people who are neither the obscurantism of parties to the corruption of some executives want to return, it will provide jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones, television, with its Turkish series, the modern world, is everywhere.
An army is now available.
The authorities, under whose command they will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already making efforts to restore the militias in the province, which is beyond the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities would have a degree of decentralisation in the case of Western nations should benefit, but through the abolition of the office of the prime minister since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted him a centralised state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country since the 1950s, long before dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional storage plants are not available and important irrigation system have not been repaired.
Everything is imported, apart from fruit and vegetables are produced nothing.
The private initiative will be the priority.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, would be a state control of infrastructure have been necessary.
The rumour was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were on the ground, to take over.
Without energy to the iron or you on the ground, and without any means of transport for the export of the mountains is no mining.
The Chinese have the Aynak copper mine of My already almost deserted, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site their excavations and remain the main employer of the province.
One day it will be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and jungen# colleges were established, Institute for French universities, Project Manager Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area, support the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military operations" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), 2012, in dozens of mountain villages numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation carried out in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which many local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising, irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of farmland.
What Souvenir let after military spending of two billion euros back?
A much more modest budget will help improve the local living conditions in these often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres liegenden valleys are very hard.
In the message, dozens of written questions of small agricultural projects of communities in the province of Kapisa.
So that the farmers of the revolt led by foreign groups, according to their own statements about her desire to continue would be less well controlled and they directly relevant civilian aid to their benefit.

A constitution with a sledgehammer in Egypt
It is a new game of poker President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily the unlimited power, more than ever, remains divided, he has decided to go for broke.
To the surprise of all, he has on Wednesday announced that the Constituent Assembly, the next day will adopt its final version.
Just a week ago, the head of state this House two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt is now for almost two years ago on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and a legal mess.
This new initiative has only for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, remains the President in his "autocratic Delirium," he continues to "his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the side of his supporters assures you that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time, the brothers is forcing us to give up on their projects, the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest has been raging across the country.
According to excess in an interview with the American weekly show Time Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this recourse to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or my memories of the unlimited power", the latter should be after the adoption of the constitution is supposed to end.
85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly, the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals, the request.
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in the middle of November, they have turned away, because they believe that they were not able to enforce their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
To reach the quorum yesterday morning were hurriedly 11 persons, deputy members, added.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that the article mostly were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... in time for the prayer has been expressed, as some members of the committee felt that the 1675 the Constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, all the attention, after all, is identical to that of the 1971 constitution and says that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had hoped that "the principles" by "the rules" to replace a stricter application had been made possible.
For the Islamists is the fact that this has not been changed, proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" reciprocate the Liberals, the only as propaganda strike.
According to them, because the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
They have in mind in particular Article 220 of Al-Azhar University, an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Ägypten# spezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people who are being asked to give an opinion, not elected, and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals will also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the university is far less than the current one is likely to be moderate.
"There is currently no specific religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, are not Ulema, but academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, "Alexis appeased Blouet, a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that in relation to the Article 220 an ambiguity can be, because the terms used the religious vocabulary are borrowed.
It is here in particular to the "four" [Islamic jurisprudence, ndr.].
And in the future could be raised the question of to what extent Zivilrichter are competent to decide."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday strongly because of the far-reaching powers, the president of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that this compared with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget is not presented to Parliament, but a national NDC.
Likewise, there will be no ban on civil procedure in military courts, as the human rights organisations have said.
The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text, which they see as freedom bedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, with serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, there is no article relates more to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
Their view, is the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President yesterday evening on television to express, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the Head of State will march Saturday.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activist discuss what benefit the law on binding language tests for migrants, act as criminals with fake certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to raise money for the upkeep of the remaining families in the country.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every working immigrant a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, must take.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants in the services sector, in the local housing economy and want to work in the retail sector.
However, the tests with the time, according to Föderaler migration authority in the future for all migrant workers on duty.
We must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills, both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian an official language.
Also are exempt from this law, their training certificates and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, and protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the audit will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of international hospitality, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants will be able to take the tests in all the cities; in Russia were already more than 160 similar centres.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests, the members of the State Duma and the Federal immigration authority.
Civil rights activist, on the other hand, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press, the following question: what is it all about?
What changes is the rule, language skills to deliver, both for the Russians as well as for the guest workers?
Above all, spokesman for the immigration authorities say, is concerned, the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the office of the Federal immigration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
But their rights must be protected even before their departure.
An organized recruitment will be 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills inevitably people with bad intentions will meet him on the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow cabin, where he and dozens of his peers months without food and documents endure and 12 to 14 hours a day of toil.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home will give you the A promised, and cheated on arrival, you will get their passports taken and do not receive the promised reward", the head of the Directorate for labour migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not complaining, boss!
Yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia want to earn their money, that it is not only the language of the country do not dominate, but also in their own language can hardly express in writing.
Of course, that is not their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only a sound basic education.
Because in their families, there is not even money, in order to feed the children, let alone them decent clothes, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager, these children will then take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills", give it to you.
"You feel humiliated and degraded."
Civil rights activist stress on the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, there is no test and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the bulk of the migrant workers continue to illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "entry ban for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants to confirm that it is not easy in Russia, an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Also costs the legalisation of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police are aware that our largely falsified documents and we are not registered, and it then cases of blackmail.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers.
Earlier in the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates, the completion of the language tests that have already been of staff told the Federal immigration authority.
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: every migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official review: this is a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, not just the certificates can be purchased, are both officials and civil rights activist agreed.
For the moment, the authorities of immigrant workers, the first time by the test, only promise that it is time for a language base rate.
In addition, new arrivals without language offered jobs in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.

Ministry of the Interior ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons to offences extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the arms law for private gun owners.
The authorities in order to respond to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven people have died in the killing spree of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police do not carry lethal weapons ban in the public and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years later.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes to the Arms Act will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities to the problems with "attraction of the screws".
On the Internet has published an open letter, the author, representatives of various armed groups, demand that the authorities of "senseless tightened up".
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 Verbrechen with application of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period, a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, in Moscow every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stressed that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons through several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons during the fighting in the Caucasus have been stolen.
"The weapons were both from the Russian officers and the stolen Kaukasiern itself," says Baranez.
On the second channel are illegal weapons, the custodians are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that these weapons are both from the arms of the police, as well as directly from employees of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.
Further illegally selling weapons come from military arsenals.
In many military camps, there was often explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases of arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Make a contribution to the black market, according to Baranez the arms manufacturers.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories, the international competition and therefore do not stand under the hand of the weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow, wasted," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia, organized the smuggling," explained the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated how much of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market in illegal weapons around.
In 2011, a report by the Center for analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Service for late16th statistics, forensic literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the issue of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are going through the "guilt of leaders in their work has to do with weapons," the report States.
According to the data, the researchers are 17% of the weapons from conflict zones, 14% of thefts in arms production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A technician in a weapons shop, who did not want to be named, assured that weapons, which are found in illegal excavations, for a long time, no one is buying, because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more likely that traders are the supply in a weapons cache.
A Ensign is a weapon, a pistol, for example, the TT, bought.
The weapon will be issued and through the fence.
"The traders, the weapon in the city and sold them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know about everything, of course, and, therefore, if the plan for the detection of crimes cannot fulfil periodically tracking purchases in stores that offer illegal weapons," the technician.
"As the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find most on friends to each other.
I had seen my Web sites and blogs, as someone who has been out on me and I suggested to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me that would like to have some place where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon was there, I learned
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to obtain a weapon, I need a friend, the contacts," says the technician. "I have a friend, but I trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and have a code "of Ivan Iwanowitsch, the direction that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am now even some key rings with a friend, whom I trust.
It gives me the key rings also only because he knows that I not verpfeife.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways.
The former military personnel, Viktor Baranez tried in the mid 1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject.
The scheme, according to him, have not changed.
He got a photo album, in which "everything".
"I felt like the luxury load," remembers the military personnel.
The buyer gets Baranez else not a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
I, as a potential customer buy not just, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we have a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," describes the expert the approach.
Shop from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results to Web pages and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons "for various purposes".
It will not require any papers, there are personal meetings.
"You need just the right amount of money," says in the ad is displayed on the website "buy a gun or rifle."
There, give users on your orders and requests.
Will also be sold to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks users "Ivan" (direct quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the lakonische question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched early-mentioned bogus websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons, crowding the service into the net.
The people are as hungry fish in feeding and then end up in Siberia and must dig coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the scheme: the site is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws are not applicable.
The leaders take the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an automated teller machines (ATMs).
"As an answer, he gets a photo and a description of the lost control of the weapon," says the press officer of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stressed that we finally also are behind bars and, if you have a question on a Web page.
The Federal Security Service recently switched early-mentioned bogus websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons, crowding the service into the net.
"The people are as hungry fish in feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camps and coal blades," he says.
A Makarow for $100
The purchase of illegal firearms, according to the experts, with prices from $100 to 900.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" you can type a pistol Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars buy.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is in military arsenals of supervisors ".
The Ministry of the Interior, according to official statistics, the number of offences of illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices to 7.8% dwindled.

In the US strike fast food and super market,
One in four American teenagers sitting somewhere behind the cashier of are
In the last few days, there was in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Berlin, Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether they will soon be back to the air.
The protests are led by trade unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests that aim to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States sales, which attract millions of customers, which sometimes led to receive more common.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and his mother, along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which is targeted at low and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products of diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to the elevators, eggs and milk.
The commodity in the Walmart branches is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Buying so many of the minor paid Walmart workers only on their own work.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, the goods often Walmart can only sell so cheaply, because the workers are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or handheld scanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases, and they expressed their anger at the fact that the contribution to the operating their own health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month was increased.
A typical Walmart employees, who earned $9.5 per hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, show that, if the company, the average wage to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
There are approximately 1.1% more than they now pay.
Walmart wage increases would be entirely up to the customers, each purchase will only 46 cents more.
Per year would be for them today compared to spending of only 12,39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine States to protests, and that the company did no losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period of Walmart sold roughly 5,000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart funds on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees work laid down and the protest only "another PR stunt" of the union, which organised the protests, has been.
"Free 1TOPSTORE!"
The protests were this week in New York, where their goal but not Walmart branches (in this progressive city of unwanted and therefore are not available yet), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billion portions, and yet you were given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation at $7.25 per hour.
At fast food restaurants will gradually increase the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible, in New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's, behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's always people who complain that they live with this reward and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is in the forum of the newspaper, The Wall Street Journal a comment, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the FIFA Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants, a minimum wage of $15 per hour, with more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
You also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits the corporate governance, the goal to stand in the way of trade union members and abzumahnen or redundant.
On the other hand, the corporate governance is not easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Discontented
Vocal protests on this day, there were also many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The height of the protests was a meeting at midday in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it should sell billion portions, and yet you were given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should all support the fast-food workers so that they receive a fair wage and economic prosperity can be achieved, every New York deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the ground, which is far from everyone in the fast-food industry, in the tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise all masses.

"The brain is so far only moderately outsmart"
The supporters of modern technologies popular subject of enlarged to become a reality in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
First, Google in the summer at its annual conference, a working model, in November was aware that Microsoft had filed a patent.
In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, will be clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
You talked about the possibility of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and virtual free land.
You, please, what research your group.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, however, want the limits of this interaction.
So far, the human race largely stuck in the period, with pixels on flat screens, which sometimes are affected.
However, we want to look ahead 10 years and the radical changes this interaction predict.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect-Sensoren a step forward, and today is no longer sold without Xbox Kinect, as all for motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect interaction on a physical level, is much more on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The submission of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We are trying to change that, are working on real three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We need the computer world in our physical world and make it more tangible.
This, however, it is necessary not only to the user, but also its surroundings.
We could then the real world much easier through virtual objects.
And first of all, we should this silly virtual reality helmets -Proporcional!
- What do you think about language control?
It is popular, but it is not overvalued?
- it is certainly not the general solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always all others about his actions and intentions to inform.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers, however, each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of management of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and tight, rather than sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not of the object, but by a bracelet recorded the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
It is still relatively high, however, could in theory be reduced the size of a wristwatch.
But on the whole, however, the future belongs to mixed management types, for example, gestures and language.
- How?
- We would like to ask, for example, you this romantic to estrelar?
You say it and suggest, at the same time.
Normally, I would say it simply.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- means that you want the adapts to the user, what a machine at the relevant time can afford and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I believe that in the coming months, especially in the development of new types of sensors must be working to enable the reactions of people to grasp.
The can, for example, laser sensors because they are in the depth of a good resolution, which is very important.
- What claims you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect-Sensoren to modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, would be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1,000 fps not bad.
But the main thing is not the camera itself, but the quality of the Matrix and depth.
In this respect, all current technologies are not good enough, as the developer of the Algorithmen more work.
It is not only the dissolution along the X and the yttria, but also along z axis.
The speed and the number of frames per second are important.
The movements of the people are very dynamic and, frankly, are the current 30 fps especially for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes entwickelte in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.
For my work, I was just such a device, only without touch control and more frames per second.
The number of cameras - Müsste not be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", with one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object deep.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It was not a flexible, Kinect-ähnliches system where we could play with different camera interest to see how we do in the three-dimensional identifying a position helps.
If I remember correctly, Microsoft, Google, in contrast to his glasses, not the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the glasses has the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant, always a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: the neatest variant would be a "rotating" enhanced reality, in which we have a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone could switch,
The lens is a personal Gadget and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but also its weakness, because an extended reality through glasses, together with others that you can work with virtual objects.
- places us for a moment that the manipulation of virtual club was in the air not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal.
There is a problem that critics often point out this idea: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing at all.
The answers to your group to this point?
- In my lectures, I often talk of the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is the use of second hand as something unusual projection document.
It takes pressure perfectly true!
But there are also technologies, which are aimed at the "pictures in the air" to provide a robust, for example, the number of Immink 386,798 ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where the finger, a feeling that at the moment, however, is so weak, as pustete someone on the knuckles.
There are also bands for the wrist on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
We think that it feels, what it would feel if it is just a little?
- This is a good idea, so we have not yet tried.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, a man who is physically in a closed room to believe that he is, instead, in an open, virtually infinite space; here, we are working on concepts with bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms, as well as large balls.
So far, the brain only moderately, and we still have many years of hard work.
That makes the work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: on many issues, we are only just beginning.

Own taste rather than culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt, the project "Petersburg avant-garde", the city dwellers is devoted to the avant-garde of the art and culture.
On the elite list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes on the borders of the city and often go beyond recognition in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be known.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded dressed in red, sometimes at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden, or take in the scene Musical-Instruments.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also are issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also a man of the city and firework through its presence on the streets of his fellow citizens in the face and a smile at them for good humour.
Recently, he grabbed a revolving organ and became the Petersburg Dominion-occupied organ player, as it is for this difficult role in terms of his artistic role, his philosophy and his image was finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city.
I have the color red as a fashion designer, who is with the optics and the image.
In this world is red the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In the society calls on everything differs somewhat from the grey standard, aggression and bad behaviour.
But let me through my provocations with the people into the conversation.
Any of my past provocations was an invitation to the meeting.
- When Did you know that you have to be painter?
- In one of the main exhibition in the Palace of Culture, in my work were issued.
I realised that I need to go this way.
It was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter had ended, and new and free painters as I was incomprehensible.
I am friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; hence, "" Pushkinskaya "10", and it was only once.
It brings me to the theater, fashion, music, really everything, except the literature.
- And all the united in your art clinic... It was important to me, in the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the "Pushkinskaya" 10, and there was up to the renovation of a musically artistic club for the renaissance, the house of the Petersburg renaissance.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
String and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wearing tight T-shirts and one of them was the composer Igor Wdowin Berlin-Fiedrichshain said today.
When the group began to play live, was removed from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the foundations he learned with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art clinic.
There, our employees and passengers.
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture meant something.
In 2000 there was a poll in the press when it comes to the award "personalities of our city".
I won in the category of "artist of the year", and that I was at the peak.
It is not easy, in new times under old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without a cultural contribution.
- your work have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring the timeliness and accuracy of the idea.
I will be an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was socially, but now it pains and fear, to be the case.
All in a clown blurred and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
For example, we save the world, we require that everyone has to complete.
Now each on the clothes and is modelled on the exterior and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps we should not be a man's hand, but he should spit in the face.
The deception disappears through the disguised.
Recently, we saw in the role of urban spin organ player. - A Culture should be as a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can also commercial art be beautiful?
- It must be commercial art cautious, respectful and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Previously the large groups of people: the travellers loved one thing and the ordinary people of the other.
Now there are microbial communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not one hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you see whom thou shalt have fallen.
Now, every cult star around 100 supporters.
- On the appearances of Michailow but that several thousand.
- To him gathereth women, in the social sphere sexuell# plays a role.
For cultural reasons are 300 people, and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and anything goes.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I have such pictures painted by a collector, even in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with images, which normally only at the end of their careers.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, this is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and rejected money in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- the best cultural experts.
They say: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Mussourgsky it was different, because the Mussourgsky may not have seen a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
What we have in St. Petersburg, the experts could be, but they will be barred because it requires more senior experts, the former properly evaluate and pave the way for them.
Now only one of their own taste.
The same is true for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters have to look for other museums.
Petersburg - What is for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones can art is difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
Us, these are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg

Birth in space
In danger.
Global warming or collision with killer for.
Caravans of pilgrims from Lysians with people on board are on the search for a spare planet.
In order to save the human race, the important question of how we in the zero gravity or the spare planet breed?
There are many choices, in my opinion, is not.
In fact, there are only two real planet we inhabit could at least hypothetical.
"Namely Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff of the Astrological Institute Vladimir Surdin Sternberg.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life, on the surface of Venus, a temperature of up to 500 degrees.
Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The issue of reproduction in space, the researchers first in terms of the flora.
Already half a century before that have been carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the bred peas differed not in the slightest by the alien species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, from tiny fruit fly (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, barrel organ quail were sent into space to explore how the weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It is a normal chicks.
But then the problem.
"The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it must stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew.
Without deep underground, the wild chickens.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn stumpften completely.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
Four days later, they died.
"We have two chicks hatch and then the whole thing, simply because it is impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew holds the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding kennel with animals flew 16 years ago in orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments.
However, on the BIOS-Manager atel# specialist beers "Bion" only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilised were sent into space.
In principle, it was nothing special.
"It was just the BIOS-Manager atel# specialist beers, but again, it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue," said Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing of the space Rats offspring.
The issue of reproduction directly in space, we have not yet been resolved.
The task is difficult.
Animals from their natural habitat are torn, simply do not follow their reproductive drove.
In contrast to animals could be the man that in principle.
Homo sapiens is Abstraktem thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women already fly into space for 50 years.
There was the biggest risk in Tereshkova.
The most valuable, humanity, is the female body.
Our gull flew, and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is it the space flight?
It will be after this flight can bring a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered this question," says space veteran Svogerslev Watschnadse tang.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female Kosmonautin, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also only.
In 1988 bare the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who twice in orbit and was even doing work outside the space vehicle, a son.
, remains a risk.
We only have very few cosmonaut, where, after long flights, everything went well and healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even for flights into orbit," concludes only Valery Poliakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, the race for new ways of biotechnology, radiation protection and the building of artificial gravity.
The monobenzyl laboratory in the preparation of Idaho, is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
Water is the feeling of weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a strange surroundings, but infants are water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony to them that life in the country, turning the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months in the belly of the mother is on the water, and that it will be easier to get water.
In principle, this is logical, as from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Aksenowa Marina.
While for a newborn child the feeling of weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the loss and lap muscles rapidly back and so is the ability of squeezing the child.
Well, we deal with the birth at the chief tool.
The birth could, for example, take place in a special chamber, squeezing the child.
"But what happens then?" Is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poliakov.
On the other hand, the child also artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung feel, can the organism the skeleton and muscles do not.
A newborn baby is not as an adult in the training in a contamination suit.
It is simply the lack of what his life is of fundamental importance.
"This experiment that we work together, which is the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will mean that we have a disability, a completely unangepassten will bring people to the world," says the head of the ethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space just a theory.
At some point, but it will be a reality, if the people in their Lysians to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space.

NKÚ-Chef: control of the Black system failed through no fault of politics
The Czech Republic, in the context of public contracts on good control bodies and adequate laws, however, is in its application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz says that the vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly, and I think that this is not the case with us," Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result also appears to be a common control by Czech and German investigators.
As a negative practical example is the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas on the so-called "black".
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls would not trouble, the system is now banned or permit?
"A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not just the chairman and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is to interfere in its work," says Kala.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common Czech German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was it specifically?
There is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature to decide how to manage public contracts to build the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this, we have compared with each other, and although the review has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws on us, perhaps even a little "strict and perfect," the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. We must also address the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? What emerges from this project for you?
Just such a joint control could help to stop us constantly to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this is apparently not particularly positive.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) is to acquire and unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be that we have the system in this way only with excessive "paperwork", and those who look for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the thresholds were higher.
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
What the authorities are concerned, it is the German equivalent to NKÚ the General Accounting Office, which is similar to us and also on a college, the only slightly different. Both authorities, however, are essentially similar.
The powers are comparable to a certain extent, and Germany, however, a federal state, meaning that the courts in the individual Bundesländer - in the German system differs from our own.
The BRH federal funding can only control what our government funds.
Public funds are managed by the districts and municipalities will be subject to the control of the national courts.
What the German legislation, which is easier than ours?
In general, I would only do so without concrete indications. Nonetheless, Germany is in some ways, often referred to as a model, but certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better.
It is perhaps due to the fact that the auditors are better?
This is certainly not, but as I have said, such comparisons, I may not particularly like.
It is worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing of cooperation with our authority, isn't it?
What the Czech legislation, what was important for your authority the revision of the procurement law, you can have any impact?
Given that this amendment is only a short time in power, they are not yet in our tests.
Since our checks subsequently take place, needs to be here with some delay.
We have far more impact in the preparation of future controls - so we have a new instrument of control "detection of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed, the changes are, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of contracts have been modified.
You see the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will add another layer of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, there is the problem, that the rules "strict" and no longer can be met.
Under the previous rules, a review unterzogenen people towards the winner (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the regional council) accountable so that any failure to comply with the procurement law a violation of budgetary discipline.
But then it is useful to make the law even stricter?
I do not believe in this way.
The system must exclude those who abuse the system and want to attack, and not to penalise those who have committed a formal errors on the actual decision making.
Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say first of all, what is not successful.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "Black system" - although what exactly does this mean?
Is the black system now banned or permit?
A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not just the chairman and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is, in his work.
He can say: "We change the law and allow the matter", but he cannot say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain events - and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer on the grounds of procedural errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, and that is what I think is missing.

Šimon Ornest: at our concerts, we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month ago, the world is to take place?
This is one of those emergency messages to the people are so happy to pounce.
With our band The tap tap, we are more fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which can collect enough positive energy in the world to stop or prevent.
In December, you realize a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraiser, which we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which end on 21 December at 11:10 a.m. is forecast.
The day before, on 20 December, from 21:00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which, in a time zone at 12 hours ahead of the Mayan calendar ends.
Comes from whom this idea?
Originally, from me, then we have the idea, together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We would like not only collect enough positive energy in the world, but we also want, together with the public to think about the state of the world, even our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the world, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz us people also can support.
The band The tap tap, together with other performers also the so-called anthem against the world with the title "world comes from".
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will also ring on the numerous concerts?
Of course, finally, provided that all is fine, and the world is not taking place...
The anthem of all the performers in all three concerts at the same time be sung.
In addition, the hymns together in a direct interconnection of Czech television broadcast live.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X with...
How did you come to the cooperation with two?
We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, which is that we realize many events and concerts.
We are working hard these people involved in our projects.
It has shown that the most interest in working with us, and have fun.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts to benefit the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, on which we are already six years together with the club Jedlička-Institut tap in.
The pupils of the Jedlička-Instituts are regularly maintained by teachers, help with various leisure activities.
As the students do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the completion of the Jedlička-Instituts is a private building, in which we do with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers.
On what criteria you have chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Learn everything else on the Website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to see in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are already in the United States, this would also like to appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their overseas plans are not just small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The tap tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities.
How you deal with these travel logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the baggage area. We must also, of course, many instruments and other baggage PreCise mitschleppen...
Nonetheless, it has always worked without any problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I am sometimes surprised some.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there have been no problems.
Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison, as in the individual countries with accessibility, how they deal with people with disabilities.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Russia, in the East is still in its infancy.
Moscow towards Prague is absolutely not disabled. There, it is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even there, of course, that a wheelchair lift, for example, in Newport.
Fortunately, there are also clubs that try to address the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we have to the more developed countries catch up?
There are still many things on which we are lagging behind.
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities Selbsthilfegruppe constantly in the public sphere, go into a museum, will be able to use toilets and so on.
But it is not normal that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in the public arena, we are with the band The tap tap a little ahead of the West.
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when one of our own great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly Spirit strong personalities.
The tap tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a couple of years: what did you do in 1998, a band?
Then I started as carers in Jedlička-Institut, where I met many young people who were interested in a little hard to deal with.
And since I myself am and musicians including Papa games, I, together with a colleague a Musik-AG.
Na, and, over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, say, a little out of control (laughs).
The band was known but only in the last few years, and I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped; we have also started to campaign actively for us.
We know that if something is on the outside, and this is not to see their own performance, in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to the extra toothbrushes can we are good teachers, high quality equipment, etc.
It was your goal, it with The tap tap so far?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that we can deal with things differently.
In show business today often copied one of the other.
That is on its way, logical, since anything new with caution, and only after a long time will be accepted.
There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that tap tap.
The first impression of the spectators usually is, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities not lonely and desolate nature, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities in something, not just for themselves a step forward, but for the whole of society.
It was for this success also helps you to be a tough boss, how many people listening?
If you want to make something good, we must not compromise on many things, and also has a degree of discipline.
But I think that this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have tested twice a week, preparatory stages and have to spend a lot of time to spend on concert tours, then extinguished the enthusiasm among many quickly.
How it works but everywhere, in every band work seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The tap tap 20 members.
How many of them were from the very beginning, since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. That cannot be prevented.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to contribute, is always welcome.
Took place the day before the projected world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues are: Incheba-Arena / Prague, Brno and Fléda / Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will finally connected via live interconnection and complete a common interpretation of the anthem "doomsday comes from" the band The tap tap.
The turning point, it is that the funding for the facilities of a multifunctional disabled education centre, under the name STUDEO Jedlička-Institut in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free maps are available at bohemia ticket in 1990.

Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a member of this most megacultural Space Agency, Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008 ESA-Mitglied).
Poland began in 1994, close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA-Projekten.
The path of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish space enthusiasts with the space, but they have not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, the talk of A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought from his pioneering work "entrance to the cosmopolitan nautik".
The ideas of the young engineer, born in 1905), the audience, however, cold, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the cosmopolitan nautik" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch REP-Hirsch donated Prix.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognised contribution to the development of space has been acknowledged by, among other things, that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Was already in 1925 in Poland a Eisenbahn-Draisine built for a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the rocket to start or the brakes of the Draisine should be used.
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry, with rocket kommende bullets.
The research, the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the traditional documents is clear that the research into the stage of practical tests,.
The research was then, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, appeared in the press of ing. Rohoziński, draft photo electric hunting vehicle, and the following year, the plant "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" Leliwa-Krzywoblocky of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket engine.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology from the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, but his work has been completed by the beginning of the war.
Another article on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society will take place in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major items of space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company.
At the time, there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future of space exploration.
At its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA to join to the 1951 founded International Federation for space, and in fact, the PTA member already in the autumn of 1956.
The following year was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902, 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
Office he had, until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA was instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1,800 metres was approximately 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959 and began in the Bledowska Desert flight tests of the two-stage missile RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be in a position to provide real scientific work, the rocket RM-34 should an altitude of up to 14.5 km and the monitoring of high end.
In 1962, however, the further development.
Successor to the first missiles of the type of RM, in the years from 1962 to 1965 entwickelte Meteor-1-Rakete.
The rocket was a two-stage missile designed, its total length, 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
This rocket were three sublcasses entwickelt (Meteor-1A, 1B and 1c States), which is different in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C about 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude fraud in all three types of 37 km.
In the years from 1965 to 1968, the aviation institute the Meteor-2-Rakete entwickelt, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was capable of a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km.
After that, the versions and Meteor-2H Meteor-3.
It is also noteworthy for the accession of Poland to the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, two years later, the creation of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed.
Poland participated in the context of the interactive space programme in the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second unangenehmen kosmonaut.

The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court, the law on voluntary work.
That decision provoked a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting, the issue of a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, with rampant financial speculation goes hand in hand.
Because of the large differences in the value of work (wages) to price tensions.
Under this concept is a condition to understand where the manufacturers tried to import cheaper goods in economic competition, making the competition "offers" to a larger market share to usurp and to increase its profits.
On a large scale means that for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since the private capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for what he has caused unemployment to rise necessarily government spending.
This situation will be exacerbated by the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling, to pay their taxes and thus the overall social, economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics at this point are superfluous.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, at the social level to artificially reduce their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to its own people to force the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages to accept.
This is partly due to economic constraints in long-term unemployment, on the other by the erosion of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there has been some years, public food distribution to the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases in which workers are paid so little that the state of their income to the subsistence needs to increase.
Such a scandal, even in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity of virtually all EU-Südstaaten will no doubt be on the same condition, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century was the case), or for a pittance on the fringes of society and about whom to hope that at some point, private investment capital flowing into the country.
There is, of course, the question of where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty of one country to another, or from the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or even the employees working in Africa for a fraction of the European wages.
The whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state not with capital to its own economy is involved, and that a planned economy to economic disaster.
Private capital is parochial in its position that the government will not intervene lenkend in the economy.
But then we must ask whether the private capital politics and that the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual advantage, legislation in which practically everything reprehensible, but nothing is a punishable offence.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department because of a lack of finances private, with the industry interdependent legal action with the drafting of legislative proposals.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All the violence is no longer the folk, as the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly in a situation like the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic's times and Rubicon explains: "The state has long been in collapse, and the offices were filled with violence.
Against bribes, illegal eighty-year-old's permitted by of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption has grown incontinent, and the people involved have already purchased votes to elect "..." people with nature is not applied for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul "..." You really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a dictatorship, and that a strong man to be elected "... Appian thought of it, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, is today's society, as well as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of their own advantage, without on societal interests.
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognize and enforce.
The result, now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least for deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the current state of view, the fall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies are seen as a break in the next round already.
Especially appalling is the fact that today's elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have witnessed already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we have it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on voluntary work here is not the solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways the social level to push down the population.
This trend is therefore system.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms, the participation of the state of the economy, the influence of the people on the government and the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory of the chaos.
"... that nothing from violence, or ever could emerge" Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons were no wars, there would be no," says the dying Gutele tighten aper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, back in 1849.
After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions.
Some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the State of Israel, the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point, I would not write about who these recurring waves of killing guilty and who is herself a victim; at the end of the current residents of Israel, including the self-governing regions in the current political situation, and have not even the beginning of the violence.
My concern is that the readers to look behind the scenes, the look, whom the 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patches of land in the Middle East in particular.
My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go out of my own understanding of who or what group of people, the events of modern history strongly affected.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it really always these figures were even their autonomous certain steps, or whether someone behind her throne, of their actions on a vorbestimmt goal drew.
We must admit that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world less concentrated in the hands of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power within the life span of a generation.
Under these astronomical rich families a particularly stands out, which could be described as head of the Kraken (I do not know whether anyone else about them, but I am not), the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
As might be expected.
The first press agency (Reuters) - the Rothschilds already in the 1990s of the 19th century, to link their name with criminal acts, whose background is consolidating its power, the proliferation of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are not on the central banks are involved, they lead to wars or equip (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government has implied).
Whoever has tried to this family, had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused, the status of Rothschild Bank of America, the Central Bank, began during the civil war, their own (read: State) notes, was murdered in a theatre.
Cultural Diversity Kennedy began to issue their own banknotes and wanted to get rid of the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; the Lööw Louis hospital Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Federal Reserve for triggering the Great Depression in 1929 to sue.
The global appetite for power led the Rothschilds in 1859, 1871 to formulate a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert of spades, a Freemasons in the 33rd, and thus the highest degree of insight.
The first war was aimed, the big royalist state sector in Europe, the second war, in particular the colonial rule of Britain are broken, and the third war is the world's population to about 0.5, 1 billion people (such a number would be for their amenities and its luxury and would also not so many resources) to create a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the advance) and, finally, on the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top, is triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (Bestellung from Chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve to prevent crises like the one of them in 1907 triggered not repeat).
Having them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation Germany's (for the destruction of the Russian collapsed, the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower " Österreichisches ungarns.
In the Second World War, easier to ignite, the bankers by the policy to create a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic war reparationen documented; thus they created the impoverished masses, so that the Germans have a sufficiently strong leaders, to cheer the culprits, and simple solutions offered; another factor was the creation of a multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, the function of a fifth column should take and, at the time of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the creation of the Zionist movement, a branch of the establishment of a Jewish state sought, as in the historic area Judäas with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration made the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks, there on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether some of the chain, ran to the international bankers initially had kept, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the plight of European Jews in the concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the war against Germany reparationen the ground for the Second World War, was the creation of the State of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war will be similar to the Jewish people during the Second World War to the victims in the front line of combat, this time together with the Arab or Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of the dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how strongly people in supporters and opponents of Israel qamutiit).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where not only wrong in an endless cycle of violence, but at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
There must be between the people of Israel and its leaders differ, but the international bankers in Israel as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates for the election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism vulnerable, international bankers loyal humble politician, who is doing everything possible to ensure that a war with Iran, which is in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly becoming a global conflict could spread, and which is due to the control of Iran on the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, to destroy the world economy.
In which light as the words of David Rockefellers in 1994: "The only thing we need is an over-arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In its presentation is the new world order, a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristokraten serves.
A world in which every newborn at birth is a chip implanted in the essence of total control.
"And it is that the small and large, the rich and the poor, the Free and the servants are all a malt to give up their right hand or on your forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he voted for the malt, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, anyone who has brains, put the number of the animal.
Because it is a human figure, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.

The film Argo: if it's the worst that Hollywood calls
In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they were asking for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the revolution had fled to the United States, for decades the Board on his regime had maintained.
For the American government, there has been no positive outcome from this situation, they could not afford, to throw out the Shah as the confidence of their allies in other countries have been severely damaged.
At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime led to the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in violent attempt the hostage exemption made it even worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages, home to a wave of solidarity, as well as an Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, the United States a partial victory.
Just before the occupation of the message, six embassy staff the flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; it helped them an extravagant story to Verdeckung their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports posing as members of a film Staff, who was allegedly in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination the genres
The experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, entwickelte plan also made the cooperation needed in Hollywood.
The camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in journals, press conferences have been held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic check, but at the same time, a so-called "Caper Movie" is the story of a successful piece of Communist, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the 1988 documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence will be shown in other contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easy to exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions, men in suits at the conference table, on the official fluren, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is with this film a remarkable start to his career.
From a belächelten actor is a respected director and actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third feature film after the whodunit No breeze (Her Baby Away, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, not in the home of the director of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the Hollywood standard definition.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played".
The best scenes of the film to play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is in its simplicity, very impressive, and it still conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when somewhere the history.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film unit at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much in too many places plot
The director also had to deal with that, the story is not many in the filmic sense exciting scenes.
With the little but he has been quite successful, but the reality is sometimes a bit - which is not always so elegantly works (the scenes in which the looming crisis in Tehran at the airport by a telephone call in America will be turned away, or even the chase on the runway, something curious).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is driven by the need for a lot of action in too many places to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, in their roles as Hollywood staff is very charming, but their characters would have more space, and that they are in the film is far from alone.
It loses something Afflecks film temptingness. It is a movie, the one with some interest in the design and a thriller from the 70th years can approve reminiscent of retro style.
Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult.
As a reminder of a date in some way living piece of history, and as evidence of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, but it is enough.

Guidelines for inflating of balloons, bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the oddest of bank charges proclaims this year decided that the competition "most absurd regulation or idea from the EU-Werkstatt".
"This idea has brought us the recently by the EU's plan, a 40% quota of introducing in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organisation of the poll, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is located, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
In the meantime, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are for the insurance companies objectively a lower risk.
"The more incredible Bagaudae EU-Werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "America» Nacher.
On the controversial regulations include, among other things, the mandatory use of bioethanol for fuel, which in its natural consequence is harmful to the banning of reliable mercury thermometer, just because this is a relatively small amount of this hazardous material, or even the directive to the size of chicken cages, due this year eggs were much more expensive.
Got criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "Butteraufstrich" or even a ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more member countries are represented in the Czech Republic is currently trying (for example, also with veto threat to the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas from the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not "heard abnormality" are allowed.
The European Commission, defended on the grounds that they are only the mixed harmonisiere national standards, which would hinder trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables from the EU against the resistance of some countries have already weakened by pointing out that the existing directives to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons sales must be accompanied by pointing out that children under eight years of the balloon bursts without the supervision of an adult.
The EU, citing an American study in accordance with balloons in the leading cause of death by suffocation of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious Bagaudae at home
Fairly absurd is also a directive, which European officials themselves - everyone in the EU is an official function, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece not to use the name Macedonia and must instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU, so that the maximum volume of food stocks, which is on the day of our membership in the area of the Czech Republic are allowed.
The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the set volume for canned mushroom, and a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or from the idea of funding for requests for aid.
These ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage by that we have no sea.
We will apply for a refund in the EU, "said in the autumn of 2004, the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument, he said that the grain harvest was very high and the government camp as a result of the so-called intervention at the purchases were overcrowded.
Since the Czech Republic have another way to sea ports, the EU should take heart, according to hundreds of millions of euros to pay us.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far, that they are an invitation to tender for the purchase of grain organised from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grants for applications for grants offered the communities, the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically, it has to be the means for the establishment of monetary claims to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the member countries will easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also for efficiency and development of the whole European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition.
A more serious problem, these experts believe that the EU grant money for projects, which have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration have in common, but in the budget negotiations were forced by individual member States.
Emotions in this country is the fact that the Czech Republic, similar to other member States in Brussels about the right to use specific names of traditional products and have to fight this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský несмотря), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, but our manufacturers in "Tuzemák" rename.
The name of rum may only for products made from sugar cane are dangerous, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU in the society of the world-famous Gorgonzola and feta cheese, cold or Lübeck-based of Parma and now the Karlsbad to carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or even the Saazer hops.
With a EU-Marke can because the Pardubicer gingerbread or boasting Hořicer roles.

"The people want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," Okamura said.
Senator, how is it possible to get the idea for the office of the president to stand?
It is not about Senator or to be president.
In our country, everything would work without any problems, I would get nowhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free, while the people of the taxes and the retirement age will be increased.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something, which I do not like it, then I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I have over 40, and independent and parteilos, I have no other way to influence things than for senator or the president to stand for election.
In the Senate, you have done it and then straight on the road to the castle.
They do not return to your constituents?
I have said all the time that I fight for the castle after the outcome of the senatorial elections will begin.
Later, I have this clarified and said that I stand for the office of president, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function. Function is a tool with which I can realise my vision.
I need as much influence as possible, and a strong mandate.
The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television grumbles, but anyone that wants to make a difference.
Come to the media, a privileged kid, and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
For me, for example, claims that journalists would be bribed or that I consultants Jiří Paroubek.
We are talking about your vision.
The battle for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as retrospective asset declarations about 20 million crowns.
You need to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have campaigned for the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone from the right or the left with a good proposal, rejected this deliberately, and that keeps the population only.
As an independent party and I have a much greater potential to support all the parties represented in parliament to win.
My advantage is that I am already without thinking and party dogma of every party that can take what is best for our country.
Watch as a man in politics rather than on the left or the right?
From Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people see more on the left.
For me, this is right and left but completely irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
It is not a question of whether someone on the left or the right, I would like the people.
I am always publicly any good approach, even if these KSČM or of the ODS, and just as I am against bad ideas.
They dislike you, if someone calls you as populists.
But you do not confirm this, what you just said?
If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have an ideal destination and a vision.
And if you want to do.
This can be described as far as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to work in the world, or they were key experts.
But without support in Parliament will remain just slogans.
And that brings you in politics in the long term, not far.
Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk with the people, we will be able, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to convince them on our side, in order to enforce these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to call on the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law.
And the addressee may then have to say why they oppose it.
A strong personality, which draws on abuses can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which is a credit to the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to allies for my views and visions.
With the policy, I have only just begun and testing my programme for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I am going to six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I can not alone; that is why I have spoken with a number of well-known personalities, whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with Radim Jančura, but rejected due to excessive workloads.
In addition, I have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, the fraud in the sale of light fuel oil.
My candidacy, I started with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of voters are not at all to the elections, and those who are gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people have chosen such a Isauricus composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and county main men.
Do you think about the creation of a party?
I have not yet thought, because I have no time, the past each potential member of the party, and do not have the money.
I have not even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
You have no money?
You are talking about asset declarations, what would you?
I appreciate my personal wealth to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a home for some 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million, and then I have a few million in the bank account.
The Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I have always liked James Bond, as he was in the car, to women and, at the same time, he was fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you do not want to invest in it.
This is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make some debt?
I have already 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that the program is not too much interest.
And I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But the support for Titus I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son, not the English school fund 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing.
So you will continue to operate as an entrepreneur, your livelihood?
You said that you go back to these activities?
But that does not depend on the level of salary.
As promised, I have my activities partly reduced.
Thus, for example, my deputy in the spring, managing director of the travel agents.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan, of the Republic.
But I must but also of something.
Monthly income on which you were used as entrepreneurs?
Around 200,000 to 400,000, and that remains the case.
As President, I would, but my endeavors.

The architects MVRDV demonstrate that the real adventure is not only in the head, in the case of Spijkenisse and the newly-created but - 2 photos
"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally, there are some interesting things to see," said Lisette Verhaig, represents a pass at the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby large operations, says: "But, well, it is already the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and electronic books.
No man is still on a voluntary basis, in one of these old-style Public License?
Spijkenisse, a little sightseeing needy sleeper town at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80.000# Elbe-Lübeck community has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands.
To counter this silly circumstance, we decided a few years ago, the general education and the seven fictional bridges on the euro, are portrayed as nicely bepinselt steel concrete recreate tradition.
The success of the educational offensive in.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way, the statistics to be: a library needs.
Winy Maas from Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV, master of this bold (and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared to contest hearing in 2003 with five books refreshs arm and a grin on the face.
And while the jury is still intrigued with the axillae looked and fellow, stacks of impudent Maas his fine souvenir of the size of a pyramid and finished his three owned a well-founded speech with the words: "Dear municipality."
It is, in other words, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called boeken Senegalo!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro toillette Berg causeway.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes Econtel supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, but the second "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award nominated 2012.
This is the faceless small city retorte, which until now had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, with its white façades you're inclined, a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass.
There is a lift, which runs through the middle of a mountain, but the real space and BookmarksEdit delights the tap fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The fully glazzing interior is bright and clear, the world enjoys floors and elegant Sanniquellie clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for park bench, dog and football playing guys and Mädels.
, and books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually cockroche and impersonal way," says Winy Maas.
We have the classic space configuration on the head and the reading area inside out terms.
The interior of the book Mountain is shrewdly: in the middle are offices, Internetbibliothek, chess club, environmental centre and the house.
A particular pleasure, the black bookshelves, wall paneling, black, even if several countries.
Optics, and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and Civil Engineers whether shake the Organice deliberately-controlled hitting the head.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop ’ s borst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen agricultural farm one day at a waste product from agriculture.
For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimetre thin plastic fleece as root document.
This is cheap and efficient.
The thin textiles, one or two seasons ’ events, then it is ready for the bins.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure to become the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogenous, capable of incriminating material to concede a Neuwagen and concede after sports shoe.
After 105 stages is at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long wandering the literary cafe with not only a fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch delicacies and eingetopft Ficus trees rewarded.
For atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in literature.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this is in spite of the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology," says ’ s borst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the book under a glass Senegalo collapse, it seems that the sun even on sunny days only briefly into the interior.
The broad wood glue binder, on the glass facade, serve as Beschattung and catch a large part of the sun.
The climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic Rollos do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry that has been the way in the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, the boeken Senegalo even Spijkenisses "long-overdue soul".
The reason: to open a few weeks ago, any residents invited to a book from his personal stock.
That is for the time being, even the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 piece - be filled.
The concept is work.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
MVRDV is the royal discipline managed, in the jargon of the identity.
Has Spijkenisse literary history.
As young and uneducated, they may be.
This is a starting point for identity.

Szabo: "German must play a greater role."
Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, positioned in Berlin on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it is against the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then, Berlin.
Why?.
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it is not the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without, however, critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to set up a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, enforced by NATO.
It is difficult for Germany on major international issues to take a clear position?
Yes, that is true.
This is because it is surrounded by his foreign policy and away from a policy of the United States pay, as it were, to a German foreign policy.
Compounding the problem, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are so between the fronts.
Expected of them, that they have a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I believe that they are keys to their role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness of national interests to take positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy, economic policy is driven by exports and its relationship to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
They have economic interests to influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful, the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries not to upset.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this is such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect, too.
Because it signals that it as an international player to be taken seriously and his interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, have been clear for a veto.
There are differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government can this position publicly, of course, not.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they are.
If you are the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so upbeat about of Netanyahu ’ s policies.
It is difficult to Germany, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side?
I believe that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case today.
So they can not be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position.
That they do precisely with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role, Europe to a European position.
This is, of course, not just for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they have a more independent role to play.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to take a leading role at all?
Or is the leadership is still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, that every time Germany takes on a greater role, a variety of anti-German sentiment.
This makes it the Germans not easy.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
There must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European policy continues, the EU is filling the vacuum at the moment, but not who is otherwise?
The Germans are simply need to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them and they are much less popular, c'est la vie.

"Trademark protection in China: if Puma and Armani suddenly be Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Conceals a China officially registered name, but nothing to do with the company.
However, it is protected as long as the actual name employers do not complain.
And even then, it is not clear whether they are right.
"There will be more difficult for foreigners, to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Tel-Peh stalemate, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing, to safeguard rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The Nachahmern rich a few additional letters, so that they can register their trademarks.
It is simply Lu-Gucci from Gucci, Prada, Prada-Kny.
Also German companies are legally copied in this way, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate Takaris opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company trademarks Zegna City Puma, an art names, which is also the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese world champion in the copying and the injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are mehrstöckige department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
Stalemate hole cases but are different: on behalf of its clients, it is the fact that Chinese companies from Trademarks officially gained the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai", a passenger's brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
There are women who are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no fault
"This is bad for business, you have to fight it," requireth Tel-Peh stalemate.
"The brand will be diluted, the only treatment disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA is China, with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Up to nine years, the proceedings drag on, with an uncertain outcome.
Stalemate Takaris reports of cases in which the court overruled Lamentations because, after the long duration of the reported name of "reality".
If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money because it violated its trademark in China, says Tel-Peh stalemate.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases concern also graphical elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the completing manufacturer Sany, the company that recently the German concrete pump manufacturer shine Champion.
The Chinese must therefore use until now an emblem, the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyers Geely originally used a blue white logo, BMW recalled; the dispute was resolved, Geely has had to change it.
The fashion manufacturers Lacoste lost in China against followers from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The Trademarks CTMO in Beijing is that there is 2010 due to lack of staff and equipment shortages.
Last year, however, is one of the "state of emergency in the work flow returned to normal life."
So is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure has fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, in the office are still 81.500 appeals to fulfillment.
It costs a lot to
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and meant that China is the tenth consecutive year, the list of new messages around the world, shares the authority.
This holds true for the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011 were 1.8 billion yuan to charges have been taken.
Simplified, this means that on average, every T7s4s 1280 yuan or 160 euros costs.
Address it costs a lot more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans were able to achieve its illegal manufacture the imitation of motor vehicle parts have been closed down.
But secured the followers continue the Chinese rights to the brand of Freudenberg.
We have failed to do this, as in Germany, family name could not be protected, said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical specialities in Munich.
The Trademarks CTMO rejected the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two bodies while Freudenberg was right, but opponents of the process is still continuing.
Must be extremely
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and will cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could be difficult to quantify, the company archive have even a hundred years old files to look at, in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, the other side of Freudenberg in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to settle.
"This shows how much we value is," says Wentzler.
Even threaten the dangers in the Far East to Europe zurückzuschwappen.
Then, if there are imitators vulnerable brands.
This was a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, the name of Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This area of business, the company has long since been abandoned, yet he has the registration.
"We must be extremely carefully," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate Takaris rates German companies from doing business with China to be very careful.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather should the foreigners' everything is somehow worth protecting, China sign "as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if the last act of his trademark Freudenberg drama is governed, then we should do the opposite royalties on its own behalf, Wentzler explained.
In the segment in question or we will be squeezed out of the market.

AIDS Day: Stampfen, sing, help
In Heidelberg samples of the choir visiting imbongi - and in Swaziland Cévenne AIDS orphans.
The story of a link, which is far more than 8733 kilometres.
First, there is the feeling: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and seek slipper on the parquet floor the tact, find him quickly.
Knocked three of four.
Then emerging the voices of the singers slowly - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano, press, and follow later.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, it almost from his plastic shoes when he, with its sleek wild gestures.
It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute for Psychology in Heidelberg samples of the choir visiting imbongi a new song.
Of the 50 singers and singer came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics, until the householder.
"Om" Obani "is not an easy piece, each choir agree has a different text and that even in a foreign language: Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
To help self-help
Worldwide, there are approximately 34 million people living with HIV / AIDS, UNAIDS estimates that the program of the United Nations to Bekämfung of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in the South Africa.
Live in Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the Riegersburg Voices for Africa godfathers in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take a sponsorship.
You are guaranteed the child tuition, school uniform and a hot meal every day in the gogo# Centre.
Visiting imbongi means to Zulu storytelling or Lobpreiser.
The UEA can speak the language fluently, no one in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years ago, the chorus songs in this strange soft language and brings them and also returning to where they originally come from: in South Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, the voting power of the German book tour.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents more, because they succumbed to HIV.
In Esitjeni small foretaste of what in Swaziland suffers: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Restrictions on the male base, the risk of contagion proven to reduce by half of the population is not accepted.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland bear the immunodeficiency -virus, with 30 to die is not a rarity.
In a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005 discovered the chorus the village, but above all, saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, which are not only a lack of parental care, but simply of everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school, in a poor country, certainly no chance.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and gave him a hot meal a day.
But a year later, the chorus of the association "Voices for Africa", which is almost professionally since the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts to sexually transmitted infections
What are the most sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI, syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI, HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, herpes and stored in or hepatitis.
These miners and Krätze belong to the parasite STI.
Who are the main stakeholders involved?
Syphilis and Tripper come mainly in men who have sex with men.
The artist Kees van Dongen estimates that at least four out of five of all reported cases of syphilis in Germany by sexual contact between men.
The heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden, candi# estrelar (mushroom), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults Grammer comparatively low, however, about 20 percent of the HIV neuinfektionen accounts for this group.
Chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than in other groups.
After European surveys three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years ago.
Grammer also come Humane Pappilomaviren among young people frequently.
How has the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.
The number of syphilis infections, according to the artist Kees van Dongen of Regio diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011, more than doubled.
Is the number of HIV neuinfektionen since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to a venereal disease?
The infectious diseases can ulcers in the genital area, complaints to urinate, flow, bauchschmerzen and vesiculation or warts.
Often, however, they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection.
Partly because it can cause sexually transmitted diseases through smear infections and close physical contact.
Therefore recommend experts especially for frequently changing Sexpartnern regular examinations.
Can be diagnosed early and most of the STI will be avoided.
By sponsor, donations and, last but not least, the payments, which the chorus throughout Germany ersingen, something comes along.
"We have a total of around 200 000 euros after Esitjeni skillfully," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself manages Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and enforcement of strong women, the money from Germany.
You are also concerned that the orphans well, in one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, how the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans among themselves, giving them a roof over your head and make sure that the children in their uniforms every day to school teaching.
Anyone who has come into the house of protection to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" a sewing school launched two chicken houses built and, together with the American Health Organisation PSI organized that many in the village to have an HIV test.
This is not a foregone conclusion, because obviously the disease across the country, saying they would prefer to be dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives.
Sub-Saharan Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also the state sanctioned way of life, that the HIV in recent decades has spread so quickly.
But also the many migrant workers, who carry the virus around the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but the rarely used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the visiting imbongi choir every two or three years, together with South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence, and black self-confidence that many at the southern tip of the black continent, even in times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in a black language as much recognition not only create mood and pleasure, but it has also been some fierce border guards opposeth shirt-blouse a few tears.
The journey is always after Esitjeni, where the singer her godchildren.
Even if the small village of on maps Barely will take place, in the valley of the Ezulweni-Flusses it is more than familiar.
"After Esitjeni, there is the light," say the people there.
And if the 8733 kilometres (air line after returning to the Elvis of singers in the rehearsal room in the east-end of the old city, you can see it as well.

Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is possibly up to 20 metres thick.
The US-Raumfahrtbehörde NASA, the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are some frozen water, as three on Thursday in the specialist journal "Science" published studies.
The probe Messenger have found evidence that it constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet, the ice sheet.
This is at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids may also on the Mercury are taken.
No one put the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix, in the depths of space.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small elbow holes in endless expanses.
The image comes from a camera, the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute have developed.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the fictional dwarf planet.
As Pluto behind Neptun revolves around the Sun, is for the new definition of the International astronomers from 2006 no "Planet".

Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope will warm by Hans Lipperhey invented before Galileo Galilei - be it a year later to observation.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes ever larger - and the insight they provide, ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the hale telescope in palomar# Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It can look into space just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of the Gran telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - alone the mélong to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres.
The detriment of cheap design: the telescope is at its height, ground to a halt, and limited in his movement.
The Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas is in the high angle.
His characteristic: the high light gathering power.
This is despite comparatively low mirror diameter - the mirror of the world's largest telescopes.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) until at least 2018 aboard a Ariane5-Rakete shot into space.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: in light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that the South Pole of the Mercury ice exists.
However, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger far closer to the North Pole to the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades, suggest that there is ice on the Mercury.

In the south of Azerbaijan, many people achieve a biblisch high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-Jährige is still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch-Gebirge is wild, romantic.
The van caught by surprise on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and lush, one might think that it would in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few miles away.
Here, the chū-hai People's group of taly adds that not much is known, except that they are perfectly Farsi and aser# talks and very durable.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small town of flaunts wuchtig to pick from Soviet times, so do not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists come from Europe Barely here is too onerous for the Azerbaijani capital Baku.
For the 323 miles you need eight hours, because the street is professional.
The fabulous wealth of the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is here in the province has not yet arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the stuff to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the eurovision song festival famous - and in the next year, we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen taly adds Babbolone enviremont documented the older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years ago a child conceived
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, 168 years old.
A birth certificate, however, there is not.
And given the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.
"She was born here in the region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva explained.
The man had been married three times and have 23 children, at the age of 136 years he is still a daughter testified.
Has Şirali Müslümov at his age, charged for a couple of decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Striking many hochaltrige people is also available in some parts of China, Japan or the hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia live very many very old men."
However, due to a lack of documentation is no scientific proof of age, especially civil register lacked.
Every day, molten butter cup
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik striking a biblis# often with age.
Currently, there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why live here in the south so many high elderly?
The Azeri travel guide Mugimzadeh Farid said that with the particular genes of taly adds.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
But that it should be the calorie rich diet of taly adds, is to be as healthy meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them on a daily basis, drink a glass of molten butter, from a nutritional point of view is not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is for this region is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, claiming that 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
You are sitting on the ground with a butter keg they tirelessly herrollt back and forth.
Eight people live under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen to prepare the tea in the typical, belly punctiform Armadu-Gläsern.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and link under her headscarf conceals her long, dark blonde braids, her son proudly in front of us.
I have my hair with milk, so they went out and I never kept their color.
"I have never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to
She has always eaten only by their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I have not once in the supermarket to buy food.
Then she told of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult of the father figure of the nation, his country as a dictator who ruled that knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan elderly.
230 Al-Lat (about the same amount in euros), receives a monthly pension Mirzayeva, here, a sum that we can live well.
And perhaps even Mirzayevas long on things son right: "The elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
You live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared for and are happy.

The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution of Sharia law as the basis is hotly disputed.
The Egyptian President Division with emotion.
We need to create the transition.
"And that he will succeed is my responsibility to the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to all the people, but above all, to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because all of them, has been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile of Grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed his powers and extended, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-jährige engineer, who holds a PhD from the University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles that dominated by the Islamist 100-person constitutional assembly as a late-night, 15-stündigen Parforceritt were pushed through, in part, worrying.
As in previous constitutions also says in the draft, the legal grounds on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles"?
It was, and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists legally-vague wording and the attendant legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
It has conducted at least one new article: Sharia law in all of these matters should consult with al-Azhar, the main Islamic institution in the country, with great clout in the whole of Sunni Islam.
It does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which is the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
The Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be preserved.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule to the repression of opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The state should also, as stated in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect and promote its morals and values."
It is legally so vague, that state institutions, with the help of this article, even the contents of cinema and literature could control.
In plain English, this means nothing more than censorship.
There is no article, writes the equality of men and women.
Bans for another, the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to offend or slander.
But what an insult is and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the wording of the "insult to the people" should be banned.
There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a Leader?
Open to interpretation, as so much in the draft, Morsi to sign before and after his words "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unaccustomed concord on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed that the Charter, even before they can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution belong "on the scrapheap of history."
Via messaging service Twitter, he accused the supporters of Morsi, a "coup against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," quoted the Egyptian media, the opposition politician Khaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum does not want to monitor, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution.
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves on the demonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer at the other Bank before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, attended and cried: "The people calling for the application of God's law."
You demanded by Morsi: "A cleanse the country!" And extremely: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would have faced a similar situation led to civil war.
The wanted Morsi ’ s supporters clearly not at risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft EU constitution, as well as the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time, the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamists is regarded as safe.
"The word "human rights is not even before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which until February was gone and involve all social forces.
The 48-jährige human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were in prison or under Mubarak in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible.
For that, he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the word is human rights, not even in the new constitution," he said in the interview with the "world on Sunday."
Morsi power expansion in all three branches of the State's lawyer did not give up.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will be a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Rather than to strengthen civil society, the president they have de facto repeal" Saeda complained.
But without civil society organisations could a democracy does not work.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community that the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
A protestor in the Tahrir warns: "Your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."

Rakfisk from Norway: is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
The secret of the success of the country could have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection to mature cheeses.
You place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, more humid sports clothing.
And they leave that for a week.
About one needs the nose numb smell of Rakfisk vorstellen, one of the great delights of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes, and this persistent smell in the air, which simply will not go away.
Rakfisk is with salt best repented trout, which, depending on how you would like fish stink - up to a year in water ferments.
In Norway, the darkness of the country and the weather is colder, flows Norwegians to a celebration here in Fagernes, that, well, really very bestechenden speciality.
"You eat it raw and Grixis it down with a glass of aquavit," says Halvarsen Coal Miner, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General" the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cube and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Like the aquavit Mansche people more than the Rakfisk" Coal Miner says.
The spirit can the smell.
I eat some hors d'oeuvres.
If it avoids Rakfisk in the nose, he is not bad, such as sushi, which is quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration facilities and fish in the autumn in air thick salt water barrels was watered.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and, no doubt with the help of alcohol consumed, steamed senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country, mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not so long ago was far richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strictly (part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, you can buy here.
But in fact is all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people, this does not seem to upset.
Here still hates it, Anders Breivik, to name those racist right-wing extremists, who last year 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians are so difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country to such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with seasoned Rakfisk distributed and with her long blond hair and blue eyes stabbing the Nordic ideal.
We are, as they say, sensible people.
Her English is exactly like that of most people here spotless.
We are not very angebe#, we may not ostentation.
Norway is very cautious in dealing with its oil wealth, a large part of the industry earnings will be for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, all the money is raised, that they had not, Norway his wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk eat", it deals with light-hearted laughter.
I am standing in the snow and put me on another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk) is definitely something else. The succulent meat told me.
But in the evening, the two fish on the menu.
The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several locations to organise a Rakfisk-Dinner where guests for the best - or, perhaps, the smell of the most challenging - fish can vote.
There is a fly with a Live-TV-Schaltung "show, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor# jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Coal Miner's Daughter".
We note and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But it is perhaps the strict mist of the whole fish.

Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico's President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto on his arrival, analyzed Will Grant from the BBC the challenges ahead of it and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday, a ring of steel, several important transport routes in the capital absperrt and on the streets for chaos.
The goal, it was not, however, commuters on their way to work to disrupt, but protesters from Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto's presidential install and the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon ’ s, Mexico can prove economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which in the past six years has cost 60,000 lives.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence," said Pena Nieto earlier this week in the Oval Office to the US president Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
With the US president before he went on an equal footing, Pena Nieto as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, the opinions on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo is remembered, for example, like to him.
Residents of the perfect place to write the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can go to one of the highways, Pena Nieto and build a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads, which it once was.
With his name badges are outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to real and lasting change," said his friend and political ally, Gabriel LAX Hernandez, who as a congressman for the party's Nietos Pena, the PRI.
Especially with regard to the security and the economy is concerned, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The congressman LAX admits that the party after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country.
He was a great Statesman, above all, he was also someone who can listen to.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view on their former governor.
In Tlacopan, also known as Ciudad neza, could the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater.
The village lies hidden under highway, tours and, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
The beginning of this year, the military switched to the drug gangs operating in the zone, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a macules Barrens near a large landfill sites were in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto, in the state of Mexico, about 1,000 women murdered - a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is responsible for the violence and the killing of innocent women Ordnungspolizei.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that the problem of feminicides during his tenure, at least, is not adequately addressed.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a Betonbau, typical of the decrepit quarter, Irinea Buendia with tears, as they have photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows.
According to the official version of events, 2010 Mariana committed suicide.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if their bodies have been washed," remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that they had been beaten, and the body rigid had already begun.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall is a picture of Mariana on us. It is next to a cross, a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, we have until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, troubler, Nörglerin.
You want that you just accept their verdict and shut up.
"But it is not possible when there were so many flaws and omissions were," she says.
If President Pena Nieto, install the presidency on Saturday, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families were in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised, particularly during his time in office to attend to this problem.
"I hope that as president, he is just as he was as governor," says the PRI congressman LAX in Valle del Bravo.
But fear of the families of the victims in Ciudad neza most.

The prosecution claims: Bradley Manning has not complained about mistreatment
The public prosecutor contradicts Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in 1908, Virginia
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the charges due to harsh prison conditions
The Army Corporal is accused of thousands of confidential documents to have stolen
On Friday, the prosecutor's office has tried to establish that the army gefreite Bradley Manning, charged for the biggest disclosure of confidential information in US history - missed several occasions on which he allegedly suffered abuse in military confinement to complain.
In a cross-examination Mannings: during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. E. P. Hogan. Ashden Fein that documents to weekly visits to the prison officers while Mannings nine months prison time in 1908, Virginia had made no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, the result of a request by the defence to reject the indictment, Manning was held by the harsh prison time has already been punished enough, Manning had testified that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of during his service in Iraq to have stolen thousands of confidential documents.
The material was then WikiLeaks posted on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has Manning as a source of information was never confirmed.
In the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning the forms by the officials after their meeting with Manning during his imprisonment in quantico militärgefängnis had filled out, where he stayed from July 2010 until April 2011 under enhanced conditions had to eat.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
As Fein him on Friday to the forms, Manning was that the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, Fein contained no complaints about mistreatment, although the officials Manning directly on his treatment had been consulted.
Manning replied that he had his concerns expressed orally and the officials have discussed this with him and, to deal with them, you are not, however, have been logged.
"You wrote (after meeting the concerns)" no problems ", and that meant not necessarily that I said nothing at all," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, Manning also asked why he has not complained about his treatment, in January 2011, when he met with a committee, which a few months before he referred to a form of suicide, to investigate.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting have been its observer status to "prevention of injury" downgrading.
The military said, it was him this restrictive status - one stage under the suicide risk is - on his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince people that I was doing well and the observer status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to get rid of a higher quality of life, in my view, to be able to achieve," said Manning.
Manning said Thursday on his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before he in July 2010 in the prison of the naval base in Virginia to 1908.
He said that in Kuwait, he contemplated suicide and is due to the heat again become unconscious.
Not allowed to know what to do with him or in the outside world is, be burdensome.
"My world fell to Camp Arafjon, this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was transferred to 1908, Manning did most of his days in a small cell, spent at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
It took him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay on the move, since the day it was forbidden to sleep, or even lay out.
He always have to sleep with light from the outside in his cell.
At night, when he turned and guards did not see his face, have it up so that he is back.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning in the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning to an accusation that he had made his statement on Thursday, he had a night naked in his cell in 1908 and sleep in a morning count naked before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had during this count, never had the opportunity to come to terms with its ceiling to umhüllen.
At the hearing on Friday, Manning, he had a command of his guard closed the ceiling, with which he would have been able to cover that should drop. He was, however, that no one had asked him.
On Thursday, Manning testified that in the previous night, he was forced to sleep naked. He had previously tried a officials to show that he poses no risk to themselves.
Manning, the officials said that he would have the waistband of his underwear or his flip-flops can use to injure themselves, but not enough.
That night, Manning said, were his underwear, flip-flops and glasses have been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge his prison experiences at least consideration and drastically reduce his prison sentence, he was at his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning is guilty of lesser offences committed, while other charges, which are seen as too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the public prosecutor's office will be a justification of the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions for all under the highest security arrangements under prisoners in 1908.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
He is found guilty of all charges, he faces a life sentence.

"My American identity crisis.
Many people because of the lack of opportunities were forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to emigrants to accuse - they call them in hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control when confusion in me wide.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "1989" ("Mexicans"), another for "For" ("foreigners").
I stood there, a few seconds, uncertain, to which I have to go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up and all my life, "Mexicans."
An ethnic acronym - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I opted for "Whig amerikanisch".
But it was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's, there was no need for acronyms or dashes.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to me in this language on both ends of the interviews.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for.
I thought about the moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues that is expected when the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Sugeria Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today as likely to remain in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States.
He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and a North American trading bloc after the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed that the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even though he gave no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans have probably never waste a single idea that the United States in 1848 in Mexico, causing the leadership of the country under the golden gun to budget has forced more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event.
Therefore, once a US officer only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country, complaints about how the Americans afflict the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of zumas go on the war path.
And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
To talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the land of opportunity, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at one point a person in our family tree, perhaps a parent or large parent - was given no chance in Mexico and north immigrated.
And in most cases, this person was a profile, dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.
Perhaps our identity is sometimes blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class may not.
This is based on reciprocity.
You can see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
The Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
Their view, is our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, they would not.
And then we would not now trapped behind the silk curtain, with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and as a child legally in the United States had slipped, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions exist because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them so badly.
While American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los griegas del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I learned during my trip, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora.
You want to Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Is now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid that you alone, Amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico to one and a half centuries, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members, just not so long ago.
After.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could be unexpected cornerstone for peace to
Can it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations, countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and the Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally end.
A war that neither will be won or lost
At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation is anything but.
Even if the on 21 November agreed ceasefire continues, this week's fighting the tough-minded on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, even though his group even large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desolate and densely ’ s corners of the planet will be squeezed, it is Israel until now failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah controlled.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have grown in influence, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a heavy, regional power that once regarded as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas party - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most Gulf States.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly Islamic stamp care before the Stürzung Bashar Assad might be, to Jordan, where Hamas allied to the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, by far the largest population and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders more public opinions.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be a player, even from Israel and the United States will not be pushed out.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, an opposite conclusion.
Militarily speaking, Hamas is not a threat.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome", has been able to stand the test of time and many of the Hamas rockets are destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in its position, many European countries have Hamas for the recent escalation of violence.
Israel has in recent years have fared well, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004, some 30 Israelis have been killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the security wall has, in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state œwar. They protect the Jewish settlements, which is in contravention of international law has been declared, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu is doing well, his Likud Party, in the run-up to the elections on January 22, Avigdor Lieberman, with an even more allied fighting earlier group.
Why this crafty nanny Palestinians and give them a state?
If they really have control over the West Bank, they would not like their colleagues in the Gaza Strip fire rockets, too?
No, it is better to have them behind the wall to contain and punish, should they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps it will be able to enforce the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could have stopped them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries are in power, little left for Israel, they will look first to the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments not to help repair its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust a ceasefire could be a promising sign, and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Even Israelis should long-term thinking.
While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination, a powder keg, which no doubt one day in the Israeli occupied territories will explode, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The answer is that the more reasonable people on both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper: two States, where Israel for security purposes areas with its tail between its legs.
For the near future, the small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar the arms into the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial swaps and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
Outsiders Arab nations should also Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
That would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state was done with the forthcoming request for un-beobachter# status.
Obama, too, must do its part, Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he lost the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were equally unwilling to participate.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Australian laws for single cigarette packaging are in force
Health warnings and a diseased body parts on neutral green packs for all tobacco brands are equal
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging in Australia are in force. This brand logos and colors by neutral, replaced olivgrüne lid, moreover, with dramatic images of users are downloading diseased body parts and furniture fell ill infants and children.
Of the various health warnings and images aside, as from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs in the brand name in identical, small letters are printed.
That Australia is the world's most stringent rules on tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants young people give up smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
It is the government of studies that have shown that people with 26 have not started to smoke, with 99% probability, then no longer will start.
"We can already in children at a young age that they understand the message, the tobacco companies to try to promote their brand image," said federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, cited studies, for example, have shown that children in the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the lowest rates in the world and the changes are only slightly on the profits of multinational corporations will have to consider other countries have similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It said that the laws would the black-market trade, leading to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
"The laws are too serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters are far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico crepería Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, notes that the demand for cigarette holders and silicone cap to cover the unbearable packaging, has grown enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months at the top Australian court with its challenge to the law failed.
Zico, up to 6,000 units sold to wholesale stores and wait for new stocks.
For us, this is a good deal.
According to the experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media in exactly the group to which the plan.
A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertisement, it prohibits them as sports sponsors and most traders forced to cigarettes in shops no longer. Now the tobacco advertising on the Internet.
The Australian government has Internet advertising by local businesses and sides, however, has no impact on international sides.
"Anyone who sells tobacco and has only a small area, in order to promote its products, the Internet is not around," says Becky Freeman, researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman to experience an increase in reports on brands noted that "ordinary people".
The question must be asked: is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that it even includes a video or a marketing agency, has to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead of focusing on marketing, with the new laws.
She has even gone so far, the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay for the new rules, those countries to complain to the World Trade Organisation over unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia.
For a WTO ruling is expected in 2013.
Plibersek said that the government has held talks with other countries, are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to give his photographic warnings.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiantly.

"You simply take a stake and is out of the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes, a photograph with a mouth tumour is printed.
Be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operators of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city of Sydney, says that the single packaging, stacking the shelves.
"I have an hour earlier, a delivery sort it, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government would simply completely ban cigarettes - then we said okay, that's it, we close," he was visibly angry.

In all the world as it is beautiful, also to be bored
Unexpectedly, this Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport when the plane was due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not want to lie.
Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts führen boredom as something positive.
If it were up to them, it is for us, and our children - OK, sometimes to be bored.
This is the brain in interesting thoughts to lose, and possibly the creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly on one or other screen rigid, brings us the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should the boredom so welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
To I come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "I: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), it is not the case.
"In fact, the boredom of a very long history," he says.
The house walls fossils has a Latin graffiti on boredom, which in the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define actually boredom.
John D. Eastwood's, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood's and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, "a satisfactory job, but this is not to" define.
Boredom is different from apathy, therefore, that the person is not considered, but would like to be.
The apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
Boredom can listen to almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood's believes that although these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that we are boring, even if we only have trouble us.
In their study "The if O'Rourke Mind: defining I in Terms of Attention" - German, for example: "The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention", which in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" appeared, Professor Eastwood's and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listen to a band, in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, which has nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group these sounds are not heard.
Those who are barely recognisable television heard in more boring than the other two groups, they have had problems, too, could find no reason for it and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, a dreary work performed, "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, can distract music and help, not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can fight even by people who are physically more closely.
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln, learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually boring - my late flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly ermüdender movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s, a "scale to Lange Review26 vulnerability."
On the scale are statements such as "Many things I have to do to repeat themselves and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I did not have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers found that boys and girls will be more boring, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - particularly on the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers with quite a lot more interesting.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contact.
He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and the homework you were bored, whereas 23%, to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom, increase or decrease.
He was sure, however, that "the youth is seen as the most boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily routines.
So back to my original question: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people are extreme physical risks and gambling or drugs, in order to alleviate them, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers to examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, the issue for more than two decades.
"With the boredom is the brain of a saying that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what you should do it best.
If one is dull and the energy used to play guitar and cooking, will be happy.
But television may make sense for good in the short term, these verflüchtigen but in the long term.
If his bored child an iPad, so that it can be diverted from boredom. It is not, however, learned to themselves or to maintain control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-regulation is conveyed from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to maintain, but gains in other areas more self-control.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not to be critical.
Instead, our aim should be to us away from the constant Aktivitäts wohlzufühlen berieselung and technology.
Professor Eastwood's agrees.
"It sounds more often than we would have to be boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people in truth only, look for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly to be stimulated, it is hard to deal with, even if the noise is silent."

In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
Who the community college student and football player Anthony Orozco recognizes is in southeast Colorado court for a crime in this country will soon be legal: the possession of marijuana and a pipe, has less of it these rauchte.
Orozco recognizes that he and some friends were in a Septembertag car in Lamar, near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco recognizes for possession of drugs and drug utensils load - excusable peccadilloes, each with a fine of $100 for - and received a court date.
"We will be treated like criminals," said Orozco recognizes.
But he is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use to legalise the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drug offences less from the law, as the site.
Hundreds of offences that turn to marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, the approved similar measures that have already been dropped.
The police authorities pursue adults over 21 years no longer for possession on a small scale. This is permitted by law, once the new laws in the next few weeks will come into force.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced, to quote the marijuana offences and people are still in court.
At the same time, in several cities to the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains about new state licensed marijuana operations at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I didn't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington is puzzled scratch on the head.
You are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is of the view that Colorado in any case, most States ahead is what the regulation of marijuana. It was the drug only for medical purposes and then for private consumption legalised.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is so good for orientation," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent, which we can follow," he added.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6 and is thus the end point of a grey area in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the property is legalised.
And unpleasant practical issues must be resolved at this time, such as the government target of a "reasonable access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities should be agreed.
"Nowhere is it more difficult, a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis ", a recently formed research group.
On 21 November Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora, in which he declared that the prosecutor would be smaller marijuana offences in people over 21 years ago no longer, and that the police "immediately" not to seek a criminal offence.
Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban standards to regulate growers of medical marijuana will prevail and drug traffickers will continue to be pursued.
In Weld County in the north of Colorado, district prosecutor Ken Buck a harsher view.
After the vote, he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to consumers on the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana on trial, while many others have been charged with offences.
"Our agency has a duty to pursue infringements, tatzeit point about crimes was", Buck said in a statement.
The reactions, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the rural constituency, shows adults for possession of small quantities of no longer.
District prosecutor Pete skin these issues on supported this decision, decided to add, however, not all outstanding property procedure.
"I do not believe that I waste my time to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state, local officials encouraged a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.
With county prosecutors if it were a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver for marijuana offences representing the defendants in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"You have such a large part of their lives spent to prosecute people for the legalisation of still cannot accept," he believes.
The first States to deal with small amounts of marijuana, such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington as a national test cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sales, they are also nervous on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level continue to treat as a criminal offence.
Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government, the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that investigators no doors will probably occur in smaller quantities of drugs seizures, but will probably resist, under the new legislation, legal, state-regulated marijuana transactions to tolerate.
Several cities in Colorado are not the fact that the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day approved some local municipalities moratoriums on new marijuana operations, although this is only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We are not in a position where we license someone and then at the federal level have a huge problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
Our community has voted against the change in the law.
We are then, for which the community has decided, and not after, for which the state has decided.
There are still many questions unanswered.

Petronella Wyatt: i was mobbed from Oxford, because I am Tory
Not only university students of today will be attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream, a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university, which I once for the largest knowledge temple in the world, for a modern Greek symposium, which is the major pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College in the late 1980s, there, I had intended to study history, I had my suitcase and so the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said that I would be gone, because I had a problem with that Jesse had sex in the adjoining room.
The author of A N Wilson said schelm#, I would have to leave the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only - a reason in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment so parochial and cruel seemed: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I have been a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, current reportedly suffers from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has assumed such proportions that a group of them last week, the same protection of equality for the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christ College, it will be because of their political views "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable."
You ask for a place in the equality committee of their College, in order to ensure that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent TV documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been shown, among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, a former president of the conservative student association at the University of Oxford, in a Rolls-Royce, and with a silver-tone suit and silver occupied protzte walking stick.
At other universities say conservative students, they are as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student at the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing leftward trend in universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without ever having met."
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christ, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the view that such a climate is "embarrassing." The persons who Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the conservative student association of Oxford says she voted for JCR-Mitgliedern a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of its members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was part of a minority.
As I was unbelievably timid 18-Jährige in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
Last year, the university voted in favour of Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education to give an honorary title.
The atmosphere would have even wake Stalinists.
In the first days of the week erstsemester#, the new students, and the equivalent of acquaintance, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the equivalent of the mockery of Tory students not only facilities, but also happily attended.
Political issues such as the miners strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa had found their way into the wood panelled rooms of Tutoriums.
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century, translated into English. On what should come, I have not been taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (live), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face as a gate, and how much.
"Refuse Thatcher fans, French to learn, or are they simply stupid?" He asked me.
The other students kicherten.
To see tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you in your free time between a couple of hours, so if you are not too much with your social activities are employed," growled to Pitt.
I returned to my room with hängendem head in.
On this evening, I sat in the College alone at dinner, when someone easily typed on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who is a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is being harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most of the Tory incoming claim, supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried later to me.
I insisted that I do not at all points of view with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A young student in philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, the conservative current Eton College, said to me: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig ".
You polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How did Tories sex?" Asked me one.
The beat each other?
I felt like homosexuals from the more liberal legislation in the United States have had to have felt.
I would ever be able, at Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would like-minded only after dark can take?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclination to suppress?
The three years before me, in my mind is extended to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only one who openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which has its headquarters in my college.
It was not only hated, a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in matters of foreign policy advice and wrote speeches for them.
He was only rarely.
He hated the place found him provincial and small-minded and turned him down for his Marxist-Leninist deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997, he was a visiting professor at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"Thou shalt not be happy here," he said to me.
I began between Oxford and the house of my parents to move and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated, Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed disbelief.
During his time in the four Luxor were all political views.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
Something they would never do, not in my city of Pakistan spires.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners on the day.
His wet eyes marred.
Enter the whole a chance.
I am sure that you only get teased.
It would break my heart, if you go.
Exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had bowed to pressure to renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums the following week, in which another history tutor seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I've decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I am my parents a "brainwashing" had been subjected to, and called it "old stupid."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my Häscher.
As they went, I grabbed a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Like you can call me a wine EU-Seychelles schlapp# series.
But no 18-Jährige should ever in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice.
And even more tragic is that there was a University of Oxford, who not only 14 Tory, but up to now behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino has elegance of the celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of Couture," which opened this week in London, speaks with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani is worthy.
This, the designers at the opening of "Valentino: master of Couture" acknowledged, a grandiose retrospective, for which more than 130 of the haute couture clothes were put together by his "Maison" in the last 50 years have been created.
"I love this palace," he says, with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist "il signore" Garavani, but without his distinguierte clientele would be written.
Valentino had always had a fascination for the sensational and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which has until March 3 to see, there is a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the choicest aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from modest fashion in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of international Jetsets.
To be in love with the nobility, must not be at a disadvantage.
"At least they are not overturned on your beautiful carpet, as some do beautiful celebrities from the pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps, and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, more generous and elegant host.
"We all saw us, if we were invited to his home in Gstaad," said the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always been the elegance of the celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza forgets the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, we went for a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his home, the decoration, the food and music, and you sensed his influence.
"All the invitees were important and loved," remembers the "top model" that their careers during the week of haute couture in Paris began in 1995.
"It is never out of fashion, because its design works of art," she says finally.
Fashion show the
The life of Garavani is not a history of, more mutual love affairs.
He loves people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House, in a glorious and 60 metres long catwalk, which proposes a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model, and is the catwalk, a gorgeous "audience" to admire the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress, the Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes, the Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather, the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls rays names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of mail-coaches and taxis, mette# marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashion maker, 2006
Many of those who say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1972 disillusioned.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the Muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to all others because of his great love for the women, and because it highlights our beauty," adds the Ex-Herzogin of Feria.
I like the colors, which he used very; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and opinion leaders in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d Arenberg can remember the first time, when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamt of the age and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses.
At the end of the 1990s, it was then.
I bought my first dress fitting tribute for a celebration in the castle of my youngest son, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a drapierten bodice with a neckline that his name.
"It was a dream become reality," says the widow of Rodrigo d aren# mountain.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," explained the Italian Aristokratin between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg preserved their evening dresses of the fashion maker "with the utmost care" to "not only because a dress is a dress, but also the associated memories."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo Jose in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion his Koffin serierum called) were necessary in order to put this another ivory silk dress with pearls, 12 different embroidery and a four and a half metres long tail.
According to the journalist other passing fads, the supreme authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the protests against the top of society".
For years, with the "savoir-être" marred the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy), the highest award, Cavaliere del lavoro, Commandeur de L Ordre des Arts et des appointed, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani added so many honors, as each of the husbands of his protests.
"I have always been his sophistication, his calmness, his appearance and perfect noticed atbyp d aren# mountain.
The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the audience Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And it says a princess...

The most difficult job in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they are 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is hell, and others are literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has every day down to the bottom of its crater, where the from the earth ausströmende gas containing sulphur in contact with the air entrenched.
After he has broken out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope stone paths.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is up to a height of 2386 metres, but the weary bodies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the pace of turtle, with the balance and keep their steps need to be careful so that they do not slip and crash.
You know that every step you can cost lives, as a French tourist happened years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted.
The mine of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each kilogram of sulphur, which reduce them.
At the top, it tracks the path between the tourists who shoot them like circus affen and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company a little below at an altitude of 1850 metres set
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (never better) said its workers, whom they 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Which they then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because of this mineral in everyday life is widespread and the manufacture of wooden matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar is used.
"As we normally 70 kg, we receive for each way about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," said Anto us, usually three flights a day.
For each route it needs three hours that he is completely at the end of the day, but then he has 138,000 breast cancers detected rupees (11.5 euros).
What a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine here, where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be paid on the day and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167), is very high," said the winner, the previously as bricklayers on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason, in Indonesia, as important as the sulphur is: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I did it for Java, for them to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often a coughing fit and his eyes are due to the toxic gases to sex.
Of the 27 years since three years ago, Anto puts his life at risk Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur in him the first mark, although his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often a coughing fit and his eyes are because of the toxic gases from the volcano to sex.
This is the price he pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I will be here for another two years of work, because I have a shop Wegbeschreibung or Spanish or French would like to learn," he promises in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or at the front desk of a hotel, but instead, he has done the work of a key esels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other agencies and, every day at 2 p.m. on the sulphur also emit at night, with its distinctive yellow color in the darkness is hot.
The shadow of challenging, it is in the light of a small head lamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money into the crater.
About 400 bodies on the floor of the crater, the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company reducing sulphur careers in order to save on costs and returns the agencies that work on their own account and will be paid by weight, no equipment.
You also get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this Natureparks together with the entrance fees in excess of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) by the tourists, the shooting of the volcano and the lovely Aasee wing.

Singapore needs babies to save the economy.
The SWF ’ s, Singapore ’ s blame to ensure that they do not have children, to the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children.
"The people of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper# songs, the local slogans such as "it will be a" Perhaps "(loaf) in the oven, the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun of.
The advertising agency BBH, which the video was filmed, is the hope that the advert on funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of music to the people to make their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The breed, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of Speed optimization evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as to compose a Rap?
1.2 children,
If this issue is not easy, is the government of Singapore.
Every year, they are $1,300 for policies to encourage the public to have more children.
A package of government grants for couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, highly technological city state in south-east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the SWF ’ s, Singapore ’ s more children?
Tang Wei Ming, Director for marriage and family policies of the national population authority, says that this is a "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This is the people, except to marry and have a family to make a lot more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social realities have the higher number of people living alone and the delay of the marriage and births, the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy has led to a sharp increase in the more targets for the reduction of the population, to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the few generations xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, the criticism that they maintain low wages and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections was an attempt to solve the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Of unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the cost of health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore also unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are being built.
It has also had an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun, the number of small apartments to check the "shoe boxes" are known and in certain areas of the city should be built.
These apartments have a residential area of 46 square metres and show a huge sales success.
However, there is concern that the lifestyle of the people living alone can promote, and that they discourage the construction of large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company el Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" much faster than larger units sell.
You are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger units.
This means that they are for our cash flow are much better.
It is, however, that the new standards developers clearer guidelines, which previously put obstacles in the way, if they have too many small residential units in a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules of the road to a rise in the national birth rate could cause is the talks with the Singapurern, working in the financial district, says that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, so it will be delayed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me, on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.
Men and women in their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that they have no children.
That is why the SWF ’ s, Singapore ’ s the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much.

The offline RSS-support offline is privately
Personal privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "the area of private life, where people are entitled to protection against any kind of interference.
What is privately for someone under 16 years?
How will this definition in his everyday life and the social networks applied?
He understands the dangers to which he has put in situations when he announced that he would not share in real life?
El periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 years, often in the network.
In four of the cases they associated with the term "very private" on a personal level and "on the password and user" when they put him on the social networks.
"My deepest secrets, I would not be known in a post office," says the 10 year old Jorge in the attempt, the importance of "private" in Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger to explain where he spent two years on accounts.
"These are very sensitive secrets, my mother should know it, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On FB I invite beautiful images or images of games.
"I am also committed my time with friends.
"I would share a photo, not by me or by someone who the imbecile," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong, obscene photographs of naked, from crime to publish, or abusive or violent comments.
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has FB and nine Folger in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother, the password to one of the accounts.
I reported to me on Twitter to express myself and interesting tweets.
"I do not know whether someone answers, I invite them only high," he added.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly with relatives in the distance, or talking with friends," he said.
Asked he declares that he will never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone a stranger empfähle him, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, it gives, 20 of the people not to know that he has added his friends list.
"It frightens me, not because we have something in common, such as music," he said.
After the boys has made him no hints or him after his address or phone number.
"If someone afflicted me or she asks me, I simply remove him from my account," he said.
José, at Ask, after he had read a recommendation on Twitter.
The boys are not unknown experience, we know today as cyber bull zabezpieczeń.
The friend of a friend, was in a social network.
You threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victims of the account is not closed.
"He has only made in private."
Afterwards, he outlined a number of steps in order to set up an account.
Unlike Jorge would this boy photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, this is something I would do if he is unsympathetic to me or I want to get one.
"But I know that this CYBER-PLANET zabezpieczeń bull," he explains.
Of key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; with the publication of these pages, but the rules have changed," she says.
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a master permit in education at Yale University and author of "Digital Natives and Immigrants' these words to explain the phenomenon formed.
The Digital Natives, they are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, even though we are still learning," he says.
He says that it is a complex issue, "because we demand that they have a defined criteria, which is widespread, published or cannot be said, in an age where the maturity that is not enough."
"You should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be loved, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he added.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions, they think.
"You have to say that they should not do it, is not working," he says.
Porras, then some possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, if you like, when it published a photo of you, as you've published by a friend?
You know what the other about you?
Do you have other people asked for permission in advance, if you have photos of celebration labelled?
And one more question: will all have to know what you do at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside of the Internet, with respect, decency and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks," he explains.
Monitoring of
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is vital that the parents of the directives of the social networks carefully.
If they all sections to understand they have solid foundations, with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what we publish and share," he explains.
According to the Guardia, the children of the lesson "Thou shalt not talk to strangers".

Conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit of the presidents of the Unasur (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced in advance and in theory, the rulers of the seven should be signed.
Integración repeatedly tried to access the signed document in the Sixth Annual meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the Unasur. Sources in the heads of state and presidential office initially told that they would be handed over to the conclave, said later, however, that there is some time on the website of the Peruvian government would be published.
If you have any questions on the text they gave that the content of the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press said.
The journalists' access to information about the summit was at any time.
During the day, the press room only the image of the presidential meeting without tone with the message "private session, limited Audio".
The tonic among the journalists from the press, some of the speakers at the meeting, the governments of the Unasur, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that during the day, was the list of participating president, what with the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media caused unease, which called for more information.
Then the president of Peru, sent an e-mail to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but the statement by Humala was not the official document on the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru, host of the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite emphatic request by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously announced, just published.
On the official website of the ASPA can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meeting stressed the Peruvian authorities that the information systems for the journalists were there, but they are limited to a large extent, access to information.
The summit ended with the shared commitment of Chile and Peru, a judgment of the Court of Justice in The Hague, which is a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima against Santiago, listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will be the verdict on the differences that we are currently the International Court of Justice to follow and run," said Humala, together with his Chilean.
"Chile has been, is and remains a country that is on the international laws, peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and international courts," adds Piñera nowlook clicked his heels and gave Humala with handshakes before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ, after Colombia for a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake to take action against the agreement of Bogota had made what it agreed to the judgments of the international tribunal.
At the summit, attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been in 2011 after the ousting of its president, Fernando Lugo of the Unasur is excluded, attended the meeting did not take part.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and finished the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, which it announced in a statement that 16 decisions and the courses for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment of a total of 17 billion dollars.
The decisions made, he said that the countries of the Unasur "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship will make the decisions on what we extend residency rights."
He said that measures would be promoted to "cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty in the cities and organized, transnational crime, as well as measures to access to medicines and on the Internet at low prices to improve in all areas of South America and in the case of natural disasters to act jointly and effectively."
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphant trains, but is designed to expand our production capacity and our people to a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided that a number of 31 flagship projects to give priority to the geographical ties in South America, especially in rural and border areas to improve... and therefore our countries unite and develop a new type of business," said the Peruvian President, in a statement read.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian on the horizontal axes of his area of the coast to Brazil Schuldvermutung, and with two for a better connection with Ecuador to ensure, even though he gave no further details.
Similarly, the final document to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations serves", which it currently is excluded.
The need for Latin America continues to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect of the summit said.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that he was in Mexico on Saturday a meeting with his opposite number of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to the maritime conflict after a question from Bogota in the judgment of the ICJ respectfully.
"Maybe I will tomorrow (Saturday) with the President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua make talks with Nicaragua is necessary," he stressed.
"I hope the President Ortega be able to say that we take this matter as civilized and respectful as possible to deal with," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention of the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto to be present.
As part of the summit, also in the run-up to the defence ministers of the bloc to the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region should be strengthened.

"South America must learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, "South America really can learn something from Europe."
Correa, of the 6th summit of the presidents of the Unasur (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans' in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing "and" today is practically a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project, a South American citizenship, which the member States of the Unasur.
"Must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
The President of the Republic of Ecuador also advocated the reshaping of the Organization of American States (OEA will be held under the premise that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and those that take into account the agreement of San Jose on human rights have signed.
Those who teach never commit themselves to something, and in exchange we sign the South Americans are everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said alluding to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has conceded.
Correa said that he does not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights" is fulfilled.
He added that it was "well-founded suspicions have given that Assange extradited to a third country, and his trial was not respected."
He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which required him to its territory because of an alleged sex may therefore, while "the Swedish law allows this via a video conference with the Embassy of Ecuador in London would be executed."
Correa said that the danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since then he has been in our message is, I have not spoken with him, but the ambassador has informed me that he had a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the leader of Ecuador.
There is a danger, though, that his physical and mental damage, because he was caught in a narrow space and no physical exercises carried out in the open air.
"That would affect the health of all people," he added.
Correa has said that the solution to the asylum, the Assange since the month of June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was granted, the granting of a free briefs, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that it is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe's synnerligen. He stressed that there had been talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, that we are not in this case, however, there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedures at various European authorities," he said.
And "if Britain this morning this licence granted, I believe that this is done."
And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or on Skype to interrogate, as the Swedish law allows and in other cases, is the problem.
Correa used the opportunity to portray himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the evil intent and the lie that freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador is no longer such journalists "and not by the bankers or hegemonic and having dominated civil countries', and I think he in a re-election" will deepen the revolution in the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism "must be firm and no opportunism and none as legally wood-panelled coup should be held," because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of the Republic of Ecuador is also the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua America» ahead with Nicaragua in the maritime border between the two countries to negotiate for "absolutely justified."
Currently, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a Southern and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they are in pursuit of a common path to be overcome.
You have to be dealt with comprehensively, so that they look forward and overcome.
He is also familiar to a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America, international bodies, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
In relation to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, his third consecutive mandate in order to achieve that, he admitted that he has this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that, if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he will withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was the probable victory guaranteed, so I have this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, then I retreat from public life.
This is also true that if we lose.
"This is decided," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I was just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro. He told me that he is a planned, routine treatment have visited, and expected that he would return after the election campaign could travel to Cuba.
"It is, in any case back in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorean leader today in Lima, the Sixth Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), with the call for greater regional integration has been terminated for sustainable progress, equality and security.

A cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the outcome of the inquiry confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."
He hid it in his family.
He decided to take up just about his illness and started to inform themselves; and that with such dedication that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the humane immundefizienz# virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s was hard to imagine that there are many doubts, few treatment options and more murderous mata.
Then it avoided even the director of a clinic of the MSSI to adopt, "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS at the time was a synonym for death.
Today, it is possible that this syndrome with quality of life to survive.
However, many people still come to the clinic, which none of their disease and know where the virus has already caused damage and her immune system has run out, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, "means the great success that the survival of patients, the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly right," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, but he said that this information in April this year by a reputable scientific publication had been based.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life of the extent of the deterioration of the immune system of people depended on the beginning of the treatment, and that those who have greater opportunities, which are dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a count of 200 and 50 years by a count of 500 by.
Simply put, the above comments mean that anyone under the age of 25 years, the diagnosis is HIV positive, in this sense, "can be easily 75 years old, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
This progress, to be reminded that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduces), it is nevertheless true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of the national database covers patients have died.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until the month of May this year there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that it since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral drugs.
Die - Why so people still remember?
- In my opinion, is the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs, the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they are unaware of their infection status, in other words, very late stages of the disease.
He makes a strong statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnosis, which is why all the people, where it is needed, screening tests need to be offered on a massive scale."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de las del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio, of his test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS era was, and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (a krebsart# hoş tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and want to hear nothing.
"If I was going to die, then three times to burst," says one in my case.
The change was to suggest improvement, I ernähre me good practise sport and take the drugs.
Now know his parents only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I am working, do a lot, have an active and responsible sex lives, I respect to my health and that of the other person," numbereth Fabrizio, the ” its intimate details with Milenio JALISCO, in order to encourage those with his testimony today in the context of world AIDS Day fear.
You should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they will learn how to live as all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In this particular places "was the distribution of condoms actually increases; previously, they were made separately, now they give us packages with a hundred piece, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
To the high-risk individuals for new infections among young people.
"Why do you need?" Is a common taunt issue of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and healthcare system, the young people do not want to expose them, the correspondent.
He suggested that these inefficient distribution newly oriented; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but output devices in public toilets of institutions, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether, under his administration would be distributed condoms.
"Sexuality is not enough; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is seen nationally in 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the cases of infection are about sex, 6% on the blood and 2% Val ship.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because for every registered case 4 or 5, there are people who do not know.

After the Court of Appeal judgment of the United States has confirmed that the restructuring of the liabilities of the group of vitro, which has a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, will be a more sinister precedent for each national companies with operations in the neighbouring country, the payment problems.
You could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies, which the Mexican laws allow, in the land of the Stars and Stripes is contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judges at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale for the Northern District of Texas on the Mexican company the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless.
However, the decision to open the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to open the floodgates to three inconsistencies because the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge the matter indicates that the creditors in the bankruptcy law in the United States must be subject to the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all, that the main proceedings in Mexico's trade to the bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in case of default by companies with trans-national profile is not known.
Indeed, to this end, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, but the American Law Institute has been used as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the societies in recognition of the liabilities in the estate of the branches of vitro with its parent company, not the majority needed for the restructuring of the debt would have been reached.
But this is the possibility of the Mexican laws.
Indeed, vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade bankruptcies) confirmed.
It is also true that, after deducting the voices of the branches of the creditors of vitro, the creditors in the courts of the United States against vitro complained, in other words, the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, no majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
The second long dowel each, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was the wicker sport for more than 60 years and has around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection in the history of the long dowel each of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was killed by a stroke in 2008, confined to a wheelchair, was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, be it as a player of lower classes, the first National League, agent and director BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the World Basketball Association.
"My life, I have many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s was," recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates this statement is not.
The walls of his house, almost all with photos and memories of his long career, decorated and testify.
The heart Bayamón
The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where his 15-year-old anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or directors of the club.
"These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967, be it as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach.
There were many rewarding years, including the five championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN.
From then, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "says Reyes.
I remember that I am Gene Bartow, who has worked as a teacher and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 metres wide players.
If you want to? "
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow recommended then free throw specialists Raymond Gausse, go through naturalisation, and one of our best one.
I remember, as he said that if a championship for Mincy Bayamon, Gausse for another.
The championship of the Vaqueros Gausse was granted to him, but even from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association.
This time, he moved it to its executions and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, when the fourth place, but what should have been, if not the Canadian referee would have been the last game of the second time repeated, said Reyes.
This group of the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who work in the Olympics in 2004 against the Dream Team won.
My favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won the team gold and the US is a struggle, as when it against us in the World Cup won bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario" Quixote "Morales, the 1990 due to a knee injury, it was not.
A team that in terms of personalities, perhaps not the best, but we won a gold medal and great joy, who was on the vorolympischen tournament in 1995, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, contrary to every forecast, we won the gold medal.
Who was the best players from Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico, at this level so as Piculín dominated.
And that, without his career in different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys like the work of Leo Arill well.
What you think is the best thing that you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, the beginning of the 1990s BSN up to 17 teams in a season.
What you have to do?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and only play in the national playoffs to teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children make many unnecessary travel and games.
At least I can see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, official and referee.
I am proud of that.
What do you play today?
I listen to music, see my time in music videos from YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.

He made all the joy who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.

She had J.R. geschwängert and threatened to portray them as prostitutes when they left the city, but also others had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, greedy man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and untrustworthy husband who sought its alcohol sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) to familiarise.
"I know what is on the tomb of J.R. is supposed to be," Hagman said in 1988.
It should read "Here rests the honorable citizens J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business that he has not won.

The start of the course, the "end of the world" studied
Every week untersuchen students apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, if religious professor decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had lied about an irresistible hook: the end of the "long backward census" of the Mayan calendar on 21 December, many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, some as "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place where the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester that ever existed," said Charmé this week, the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analysis of what has happened in the world, as if we were 30 days away, it would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor, this semester, which, in fact, the last in history, courses on the "end of the world".
In Temple, the beisitzend Professor Barry vacker track "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week untersuchen students apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We are analysing why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios will be offered at a particular human behavior.
If nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war will break out.
This month, analyzed the students films with apocalyptic terms content and studied how they compared with the real life could compare.
"I have tried to inform the students as possible, probably, credible and is impossible," said vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a beisitzend professor of art history and anthropology, a team formed a course with the simple title "The end of the world".
"We are not in 2012, so that we always retain the option, to be able to hold the line, in the event that the world is not," said Restall.
Despite the "impending doom", the students study, projects and statutory audits.
In Penn State will be the final test on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other choice than to continue to work at night, where the world supposedly comes to an end, "said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no places more" said Restall on his course for students with a high average, which is filled with 35 students.
For weeks before you start we received e-mails from students who asked whether more seats are free.
For its part, the students say that of course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden of religion and sociology from age, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really just a question of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and health care, all the apocalyptic films to have seen.
"Never have I heard something of a classroom, where they will be informed," he admitted.
I enjoy it.
But none of the surveyed students - and even less a professor, said that the last date of December 21 to believe.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Maya, and in some way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya never said the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in the western society an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries, when the people on changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased speculation.
"Elsewhere, people do not think so," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world, the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at the University of La Salle, which this year in the Philippines, responding quickly to the question of whether he is there, a course on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines is not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as a suggestion for an exception to a higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days last court has spoken, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people immediately think of a new date" Chiabrera or that the December 21, the beginning of a seven-year period, according to the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date.
Several said that they were about to celebrate the end of the world ".
"Maybe I call a few friends, so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
