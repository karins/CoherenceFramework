A Republican strategy to confront the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policy with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter as a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States, as the number of people killed by lightning.
The attorneys for the Republicans have seen in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of election fraud.
One thing is certain: these new rules will adversely affect the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the federal states for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments announced since 2009, new laws that make it difficult for the process for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has won after the elections of November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives were able to be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011, which restrict the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws that require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also will be shortened by the time frames for the early vote, declared the law invalid, to register as voters on election day, and denying citizens the right to vote, for which a court acts.
Before the elections of 2006 has to show no US government demanded by the voters, photo identification.
Indiana was the first state that has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.
Over the last two years before they helped to draft legislation in 34 states, with which the voters will be forced, photo identification.
It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal identification card as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters who do not have their own state authority of a government issued picture identification.
In addition, five million new voters in the 2012 does not have such a card.
However, often paying more than a hundred dollars to obtain the necessary papers.
The new restrictions on young people, minorities and low-income people are affected disproportionately.
In fact, with 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification.
This goes further.
The students, who are seen as voters who cast their ballots for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not permitted to use their of their establishment issued photo identification.
On the other hand, allow same states choose members of fishing and hunting clubs, the more on the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
In 2004, a federal state asked for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state created such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures aim clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states laws promoted, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
Furthermore, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the registration of voters in the general election in 2004 to register some 10 million citizens.
Because of the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%.
Moreover, the Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed to shorten the period for the early vote.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the White, which constitute 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate, voted in advance.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters vehemently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states passed laws that require the flagship of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim of influencing the results in the decisive state for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that this legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will adversely affect the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.

Prostate cancer screening test: should be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes with false negative results, INACCURATE or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to greater hesitation previously undecided men for the implementation of early detection tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have asked for the opinion of two doctors.
The studies conducted in the United States were many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe came to the conclusion that there is a big difference in mortality rates of patients with and without detection.
This study has shown that the likelihood of metastasized around 30 to 40% is a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years later, when no early detection was carried out.
I therefore commend the test from the age of 50 years ago or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, which was already ill with prostate cancer.
In men, African-American origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as the cancer was detected.
There are cancers that others who are aggressive and indolent.
The patient must be the extent of his cancer risk really understood to be made by the possible options, showed him where Prostatakrebse can remain untouched, if it affects the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases, rather than an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, which we did not detect cancer treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
We certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated, and who is not.
I therefore commend the implementation of the test.
But the most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be executed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society for urology Movember has developed a tool with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of the PSA tests.

Prevention of the disease.
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress of research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and will be sufficient.
"If there were no smoking more, this value would rise at least 50%," Andr- Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society said.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society of the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," the spokesman Andr- Beaulieu Deplores.
Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, reduced the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also support the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, Grimmdarm, pancreatic, oesophageal Mastdarm, and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, it increases the risk of contracting a Grimm or broiler colon cancer.
Sausages should be avoided.
The preservation of meat, smoked, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins.
In recent years, several scientists examined the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their investigations are currently do not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
During a study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D also revealed the cancer was not yet clear.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu stressed how important it is to talk with their doctor about his concerns and his family England.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."

Analyzing the Higgs boson
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosons last summer, has caused a stir, and for good reason.
It is believed that this only is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And, finally, is the last particle whose existence was of the standard model - our best, or at the very least "false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but observed empirically or not.
But for the physicist, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particles, and that it is predicted by the Standard Model Higgs boson.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week on a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data in order to be completely safe.
However, we believe that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we look at what is at stake.
In a world where there is inevitably a crucial law, which means that two objects cannot be at the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and you try not to because they will hurt themselves.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law for you: 'the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "elementary," while the "state" is, by and large, from some of their properties.
Assuming the physicist, a part of the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione Ina and obey the principle.
And in another move the bosons, a gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, certainly not this principle, which means that they are in fact at the same time in the same place.
These bosons itself, according to the Web site The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is) absolutely amazing into two groups: the decay that we will not treat here and the "power" through which the great forces of nature and spread the Higgs boson, which would be used in any way.
It must be emphasised, however, that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a bosons of exceptional banality: the Photon or "light particles," which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a speeding Particules with an electric charge or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field at precisely this place "disturbed," like a pebble, who was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbing" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "of power."
More stable Militara
The same is true for the Higgs boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs field, should "be disturbed" that this only shows.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energy, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could be zerfurcht only by a very large rocks.
Therefore, a giant particle accelerator as CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, would never be a sheet of paper on the refrigerator.
And not all particles interacting with the Higgs field: those that do have a degree, while the other (such as the photon) have no mass.
For what can all this research is now "well," said Mrs Plamondon asks?
For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they will enable physicists to investigate all the differences between the observations and predictions of SM.
There are, in fact, a number of physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has some serious shortcomings, because it offers no explanation for the gravity (UPS!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe, UPS (again!).
However, at CERN such exemptions were not found until now.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories not suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution.
You saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, developed in 1962, and even the first time line were the first laser gepulst) - has already said that the laser was seen at the beginning rather than a "laboratory gimmick."
Imagine...
In addition to applications from all the instruments that surrounded the research.
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle Rihák has developed during his work at a small room.
Although it was not the original purpose, serves this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" in 2009 and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that we can never really know...

Palliative care - the best way to die... | le devoir
With your Committee for "death with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of the living.
The debate must be included in the near future, although a bill is being prepared.
However, in this important area, much remains to be done.
Le devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the montérégie.
The prostate cancer, the aufzehrte him, he had a period of two years.
"They gave me to live five years, I made seven years," he said, half-hearted in his bed at the home of Victor-Gadbois beloeil in palliative care, in which he had arrived the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, and you can't be prepared," he says.
The disease does its job: an immense weakness prevents him from to go to the bathroom alone and even to eat.
On the table before a delicious lunch, agrees to help he resigned, to get the food.
Brave it manages to smile and even to talk with the stranger, which employs around him, bring him his medication, and give him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, since this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this malady.
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man pinkelt in the face," Pierre had 10 shutouts, a psychologist at the Home, Victor-Gadbois told.
In the early stage of an unacceptable humiliation is to return for some people.
"That depends on the ability of the person," to take a step backwards, he notes.
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, in the midst of this major setbacks.
The patients who are placed in the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, you will be inundated by the doctors and nurses who care for them, not with the so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is aware of, "and" to die of suffocation.
But the disease, I have learned my children really know.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have no more hope in life," she says, before she accepted that it puts on a mask, which helps her breathe.
They expected in the next few days still have a last visit their son, who is from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois offering with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the food intake.
The palliative care will be used if there are no other options.
To make the dying.
In Quebec a bed for the palliative care comes to 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little, if you take into account the fact that we all die one day.
Here, life will continue under the best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
Given the dying according to request an oral care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we have a beer served Mr X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," nursing director Nathalie Savard reported.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is not like the other day.
In addition to an old man from 93 years, enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and well supported by his pillow, while one is in his honor, dies, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children, tragically, after he tried to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds are filled with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years ago," said Dr. Christiane Martel tells worried.
53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to relieve the suffering of patients when they reached the final stage of their lives, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
These very serious shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
For the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel, according to the health system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting a move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, without being able to take measures to alleviate their.
I fear that patients are dying simply because they have not received adequate health care.
And at the same time, several ONCOLOGIST their patients despite the worst predictions stubbornly to the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as they canceled an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin, that I will drop out of treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, they said.
However, she had told me that I was at the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have requested to die, the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish to thank after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said clearly that palliative care is not when the pain treatment.
After Elsie Monereau palliative care, head of the society of domestic palliative care of Montreal talk about 8% of patients to a pain treatment.
At the end of life, the doctors so often-terminal sedation, which amounts to the patients either einzuschläfern sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we take this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have to rely on these-terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is relieved not to say all the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want them to put me," but "I want my pain is relieved."
The realization of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.

Large-scale real estate scandal in Quebec
Officials of the Road, companies in the construction sector, the main political parties and fundraisers specialists of the Italian Mafia Geschichten- every day, what do you know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are enmeshed.
An "industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures," said Jacques Duchesneau, in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police provide.
The scandal was exposed by him on the basis of a thorough investigation of embezzlement in connection with the contracts to size in Quebec, the former prime minister had agreed only reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between the industry, the secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he said, "the Transport Ministry alone could have saved a billion dollars in the treaties," because some zügelten their instinct to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "already has two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it will succeed, "to show the tactics behind the individuals."
In a 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit
The 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit launched with their troops to auditors and analysts estimate the government too much effort.
Also, the police force, "the" marteau, since 2009, that the "sewer cartel" of Montreal, in the artificial inflation of the Treaties restrained...
In recent weeks, it has a domino effect carried out house-to-house searches and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against local assemblies as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next item on the list, Gilles vaillancourt, resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec, Canada's third largest city.
He is suspected to have received in exchange for public contracts repeated bribes.
The engineers were accused menioneaz Straßenbauamts from Montreal, and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino zambito.
The latter has attracted attention by the Commission, he explained the workings of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He has paid for several years, 3% of the value of the contracts in Montreal with the Mafia related mediator, gave the money to the Union, Montreal's mayor, Gérald Tremblay.
Mr zambito has had in the 2000s throughout his hand in the game, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) at provincial parties, especially on the back of his liberal.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him.
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was going smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles surprising before the Commission has described in detail: in ten years he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to 736.000 dollars in exchange for contracts, which will cost it aufblähte artificially.
Other officials of the Road have admitted that they were bribes by itself, with false invoices aufblähten services artificially by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay accused of deliberately overlooked a shadow budget, which has filled its coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations is Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the proposed alarm.
As mayor of the city district Rivière-of-prairies, in the east of the island, they came from 2010, against the sale of municipal land on that for 5 million dollars bought and sold for 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% of black money in election campaigns.
The investigation, which is being carried out at the end of the day, she says, that "on a thread that makes it possible to understand the workings of the system of suspected of ants, in order to stop this evil and to denounce the perpetrators."
She says that the process "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but would only for Montreal certain investigation unit, as well as a supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
As you clean power.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau on notice that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially concerned about the role of the "mandate, who are on the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a share of more than 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec he provide: "I have been told that this is only a weak simulacrum of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at 100 dollars, according to him, nothing would change in the situation: "as long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and the financing of political parties: "we cannot fall deeper; by the things we deal with courage, we can build the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws again."
If this story is damaging the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh at it, to take a look in their own backyard.

"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season they have adopted with PSG a new dimension.
How would you explain this progress?
You can say it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on its side.
The technical staff gave me too much.
These elements spur me on a daily basis to improve my game.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football everything goes very quickly.
But I break in enthusiasm.
Since my start in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
You are thus introduced by Carlo Jeff competitive advantage...
The newcomers this summer are accustomed to playing very high levels.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me who must face and his best wishes to be.
Incidentally, Jeff Carlo gives me a lot in terms of my game position.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Jeff is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Jeff inspires all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no Compareable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He draws on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
This time I had just recovered from an injury.
The trust he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of Lyon, while only finishers are awarded sprint points.
But we lurk in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League is: we have qualified for us in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we are going to play against a very good European teams have our say.
First of all, we want to be first in our group, Porto, so that we can carry out the return leg of the Achtelfinales as home game.
The PSG can be in the short term, a major European club?
He already has the budget...
In order to be a great European club, Paris has to win the title and make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
PSG is the financial resources to make this project takes concrete forms.
It would be a big failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really at the heart of this volume.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough in order to secure the victory.
We have finished the season with a strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I believe that this is the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been spent and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept that.
But if we can win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and we still have a little place, which they accuse us, it is a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
You look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, failed to qualify for the first knockout round, and has also made huge expenditure.
In relation to the sums invested believed you to the game with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup would ignore.
, Lyon and Marseille, who were in the last season was not good geboostet of this new PSG. "
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that we won it, despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better that people speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals.
That is why he has come and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has to see that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respected the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was for me to take part in the heart of this European Championship.
Unfortunately, to slap me my injury prevented some game time.
I saw things that I am emerged stronger.
Today, I will be able to achieve good games in the national team.
Since this was my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what occurred in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson and now we need to put an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national team coach is strictly, is close to the players and the victory.
As Laurent Blanc was it.
But I would like to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal when he qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" after Brazil.
The 16 October forced a draw in Spain (1: 1) an opening match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
Before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.

With Bitcoin pay and selling without bank is possible.
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified and transaction processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies to reach a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies designed to financial crises.
In fact, this is of Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (dollar, euro convertible, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange as BitTorent, which provides for the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network about 200,000 transactions were already covered.
Several thousand Web pages Bitcoin accept a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had five months later, he fell to 2 dollars today, before it recovered to around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the Web site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to the world trade by Realen currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) shows in an October report on virtual currencies interest.
She describes as "the virtual Bitcoin currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a video game, you win the game or buy (and sometimes to share).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, the trade is controlled by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin network nodes are all at the same time, the invoice book, securities firms, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user choose a different address for each payment, which the anonymity.
A number of this transaction-related data will be signed electronically through a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins are traded in the entire network of widespread accounting book of public accounts.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is happening on a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, is a sort of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e., the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
"The use of" the new transaction and add a number, before the whole thing will be hacked. "
The goal is to find the one number that gives a unique fingerprint (many leading zeroes).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can look effortless, whether it is the right thing to do.
The transaction is thus linked permanently with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay to defraud two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without VerknÃ1, because both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The circulating in Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, leaving a margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is improving with each performance.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stole the Bitcoin deposits.
"The common vulnerability does not affect the actual Minutes," Pierre Noizat Paymium, has introduced a company to pay with real money and the network Bitcoin uses assured.
The ECB also reported on the activities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash has also these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations.
Others, such as the blog platform WordPress they are accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyses of the Weizmann Institute in Israel and the invoice book shows that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-Schlussverkauf" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company, the Bitcoins Coinabul converted into gold.
, Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on the currency is a firm believer in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses but Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system can be implemented easily with retailers, and the latter must install any new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to give an address that can be photographed by a telephone "and recognized," Pierre Noizat indicates that assured that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend, the hierarchical systems are covered in favor of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time before Bitcoin prevails in 2013, but could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, moreover, to assess the various, today as high-risk in the event of a success of this currency.

We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are likely to follow suit by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army to take possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their own future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished by the Afghan farmers in particular, we have seen them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 slain soldiers and injured and crippled.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed international presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if you Paysafecard jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Sometimes tolerated, supported by local insurgents, the latter will be here any more, if the Western countries are discreet.
Funded by the base in Nijrab, I watched by a with almond trees and hills, using the French loans from the withdrawal of French troops, was carried out properly.
The truck überflogenen helicopters and armored convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked.
By the end of 2014, there will be no Einströmen more of the Taliban regime in Kabul.
Since her irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions changed.
At the time, Kabul was empty and the country plunged because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war.
Their power was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the al-Qaida organisation overpowered farmers, but their situation has improved. "
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They have turned in the commercial property confiscated by the government in order to sell land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive American of subcontracting.
You have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting.
As I heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not made of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who have managed to make the American contributions: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities of the public schools are full of girls as young.
These young people, who want to return to the obscurantism, neither the parties nor to the corruption of some executives, you will need to provide jobs.
All, including the armed factions, are obsessed with mobile phones, the television with his Turkish series, which represent a modern world is seen everywhere.
An army is now available.
The authorities, under whose command they will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle has already committed to the restoration of the militia in the province, which will be beyond the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should have some degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations benefit, but through the abolition of the office of the prime minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make him a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzai wants no foreign controls, especially during the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been around since the 1950s and before long dependent on foreign aid.
Industries were never rebuilt, functional storage plants are not available and major irrigation system has not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables are produced nothing.
The private initiative will be the priority.
In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforced the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, to seize it.
Without the energy to handle the iron or copper ore on the spot, or without an export over the mountains no mining is possible.
The Chinese have the copper mine of MES aynak already almost deserted, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to turn on the huge Buddhist site their excavations and the main employers remain in the province.
One day, it will be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which imports and exports are largely dependent on re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young French Institute for colleges, universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sectors, support the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages held many charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carry out of a small French non-governmental organization, to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which many local workers were needed, have helped to suppress the insurrection, wells, irrigation and drinking water, restoration, fruit trees, soil conservation and increase of farmland.
What souvenir let after military spending two billion back?
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions that are in this often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres underlying valleys very hard.
In the message received dozens of written questions small agricultural projects from provinces of kapisa.
So the farmers get rid of the insurgency led by foreign groups, which, according to its own statements, her desire to continue lower, well-controlled and civilian aid would be directly related to their benefit.

A constitution with the sledgehammer in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains divided on the constitutional declaration, the authority granted unrestricted Provisionally, more than ever, he has decided to go for broke.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly the next day will pass its final version.
Just a week before the head of state had given to this House two additional months for the conclusion of his work.
Egypt is now for nearly two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and a legal muddle.
This new initiative has provided only for an even greater divisions in the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," he continued, "by breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the part of his supporters can rest assured that there is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time, the brothers forced to abandon its plan to explain the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president is to find a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, during the protest rages across the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the US weekly Time Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor.
Since the Egyptian people with this back on a hasty vote is an ultimatum: "either vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly to an end.
85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly approved the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has fulfilled the request.
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned away, because they believe that they have not been able to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or the society acted alike.
To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, deputy members, it added.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were approved unanimously.
The commentators also found it amusing that the only difference of the day is the time for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the pendulum clock the Constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, attracted all the attention, identical to that of the constitution of 1971 and says that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement had hoped, "the principles" by the rules "to replace what made a stricter application was possible.
For the Islamists, is the fact that this article was not changed, a demonstration of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" liberals say that have seen only as propaganda.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is based on other items.
They have been especially Article 220 in the eye, which recognises the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly with regard to verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie pommier this is worrying, because the people who will be asked to give its opinion, "are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals are also fed by the fact that the next chancellor of the university may be far less moderate than the present.
"At this moment is to identify any specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, are not ulema, but academics who have been trained on the part of the French system, "Alexis Blouet, who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition appeased.
But he concedes that "220 can be available in relation to the article an ambiguity, as are the terms used by the religious vocabulary.
It is here, in particular, the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of whether civil judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday will severely criticized because of the far-reaching powers he has given the president of the republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that they are compared with the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but a national defense council.
There will also be a ban on civil procedure in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter with also share their fears in the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right of free expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President yesterday evening on television saying something, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of head of state are on the march Saturday.

"The great and powerful leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While lawmakers and human rights activists to discuss what the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminal act with fake certificates
13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the home remaining families.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which everyone working immigrant must pass a test that certified knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to immigrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests of time, according to federal immigration authority should be for all future guest workers on duty.
It is not just language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
The bill would also exempt people who receive their education certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Meaning, and the protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the review will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of Friendship, the Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants may take the tests in all cities; now in Russia were already more than 160 appropriate center opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal immigration agency.
Human rights activists, however, said before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: what makes the whole thing?
What changes to the legislation, which must have language skills, both for the Russians as well as for guest workers?
Above all, spokesman for the immigration agency, say it is trying to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," the head of the representation of the federal immigration agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew says.
Their rights must be protected, but before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.
Migrants on problems without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future immigrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which will put him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he endure with dozens of his peers months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
Us many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home that will give you a promise, and on arrival, they are cheated, have lost their passports and not get the promised salary," the head of the General Administration of labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow confirmed.
Not complaining, boss!
Yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money, that they control not only the language of the country, but not in their own language hardly prestrilor can express.
Of course, this is not your fault, but the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only a sound basic education.
Because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager, these children and then take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Human rights activists say the law following important aspect.
The test only migrants must discard with legal status.
You do not have that status, so there is no review and no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "banned for unauthorized access."
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get in Russia, an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Also, costs the legalization of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration you can do quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are fake and we are not registered, and then resulting cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow speaks to journalists.
"Just to spare no expense for false papers."
Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some Gefaelschte certificates to certify the completion of the language tests were already beschlaggenommen by employees of federal immigration authority.
The fake papers were printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant who hoped to save the tests to be paid for the document thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this is a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be bought, both officials and civil rights activist, agreed.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers, the case for the first time by the test, only promise that you have time for a language courses.
Moreover, in areas are newcomers without language skills offered to people with no active understanding is necessary.

Interior Ministry ignored illegal arms market.
Share of legal weapons to offences extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of the arms bill for private gun owners.
The authorities to respond to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven people died in the rampage of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police wants to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes will be presented at the Arms Act in the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems through "attraction of the screws."
On the Internet, an open letter was published, the author, representatives of various armed groups - from the authorities want to tighten "futile."
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the Strafrechtler, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC said.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes committed with the use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The author of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will deter criminals not to use on the black market.
Nowadays you can find in Moscow, according to the authors, every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry said that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The arms go through multiple channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who was 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff told.
Screenshot of a Web page, which takes on arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen from the Russian military officers, as well as the Kaukasiern Baranez itself," says.
On the second channel illegal weapons, the parcel was stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that count these weapons, which were both chambers from the arms of the police as well as from employees of the law enforcement authorities stolen.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals.
Many military camps often came to explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases of arson was in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
A contribution to the black market, the arms manufacturers make gem-- Baranez.
"Nowadays there are squandering countless private arms factories that will stand up in the international competition and therefore not under the hand of the weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow," the expert said.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a small-scale production, as well as their own, sometimes a mafia, who organized the smuggling," the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated that each of the five channels on the black market in illegal weapons around.
In 2011, a report was submitted by the Center for problem analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal State Statistics Service, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the issue of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market, there were reached by the "debt of leaders to do their work with weapons," reads the report.
The data, according to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% due to theft of weapons production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
, a sales consultant of a gun store, which does not want to be named assured that weapons found during illegal excavations, nobody buys long, because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more likely that traders get the supplies in a weapons cache.
On a Dramatis a weapon, a gun is bought by the TT.
The weapons will be issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealers brings the weapon in the city and sold it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he tells
"The police know, of course, about everything, and therefore, if they cannot meet the plan for the detection of crime, periodically Kontrollkäufe at dealers, illegal arms sales offer," the adviser added.
"As in the luxury goods."
Buyers and sellers find most familiar with each other.
I had seen websites and blogs, as someone who has been on me and I proposed to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would be waiting for me, I would be at a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the ceasefire until I was there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, do I need a well-known, the contacts," the adviser said. "I have such a well-known, but I trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go and meet with a code as "by Ivan Iwanowitsch pregnant.-, the daughter lost a tooth."
I am currently even on some key rings on a well-known, I trust.
He gives me the key rings also just because he knows that I verpfeife him not.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldiers, Viktor Baranez dabbled in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schemes have changed, according to him.
He got a photo album, "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like in the luxury goods," the military personnel recalls.
The buyer gets loud Baranez not a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
I simply do not buy as a potential customer, but only with the seller in the forest, and we have a target.
"If I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," said the expert describing the action.
Shopping from the couch
Internet search engines show search results to websites and groups in "VKontakte," where weapons are available "for different purposes."
It will not be required, nor are there any papers face-to-face meetings.
"You need just the right amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "fight gun or rifle purchase."
There, users to enter their orders and ask questions.
Will also be sold to minors?
"Of course, without a license," user "Ivan" asks (direct quote).
"A TT. Moscow," the laconic question of "Fedorenkow."
The federal security service recently shifted innumerable bogus Web sites, and the arms purchase, shoppers are crowding into the service.
The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and then end up in Siberia and shovels coal
Military commentator and former soldiers, Viktor Baranez
I have heard of this scheme: the site is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The leaders to accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through a bank machines.
"When he gets a photo and a description of the captivity of arms," the press spokesman for the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" reported Dmitri Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stressed that you can go out and to finish behind bars, if you have a question on a Web page.
The federal security service recently shifted innumerable bogus Web sites, and the arms purchase, shoppers are crowding into the service.
"The people are as hungry fish in the feeding and in the Siberian labor camps and shovels coal," he says.
A Makarow for 100 US dollars.
With the purchase of illegal firearms is expected, according to the experts, with prices ranging from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislow of the organization, "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait for up to a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military arsenals of middle-ranking supervisors.
The official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, according to the number of offences with illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand back, while the number of cases of theft and extortion shrank in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices at 7.8%.

In the United States almost food- and supermarkt- workers strike
One in four American teenagers sitting behind the cash point of Mc Donald's
In the last few days, it came across the United States to massive protests against low wages of Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue or whether you Distention soon from the air.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary workers almost food- and Wal-Mart, the organizers of the protests aim to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly organized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, sales were held in the United States, which attracted millions of customers, which led to Handgemengen.
On this day, some Wal-Mart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target audience are low and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores in the interface between 8 and 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
As a result, many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only at the workplace.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart has become one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Wal-Mart, the goods can often only sell so cheaply, because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, lack of forklift trucks or handheld scanners.
The participants in the protests in the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their irritation that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Wal-Mart employees, which earned 9.5 US dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company increased the average wage at 12 dollars an hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars it would cost.
The donations are about 1.1% more than they now pay.
The Walmart wage increases to the customers, every purchase you will only 46 cents more.
Every year, this would be for you in comparison to now more spending by only 12,39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it came only in nine states to protests and that gave the company any losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period, Wal-Mart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart funds from led to the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing not post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees working time and the protest action only "another PR stunt" of the union, which organized the protest, was.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where your goal, however, were not Walmart stores (which are welcome in this progressive city and therefore does not exist yet), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work.
Jumaane williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law stands at 7.25 dollars an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, according to the minimum wage will be raised, but not too much, and on average, their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars an hour.
No less than they deserved in this expensive city.
How it is possible to come to New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American youngsters after school at McDonald's behind the counter, however, the young people still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income and planned to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that they have to live with this wage and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, there are in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper in a commentary, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if they did not know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the FIFA Street and Madison Avenue, demanding that the cashier and chefs from fast-food restaurants a minimum wage of $15 an hour), which represents more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
It further demanded the formation of unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law that prohibits the company leadership to stand in the way of that goal and union members to admonish or being fired.
On the other hand, the corporate governance is not easy.
The formation of unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
Lautstarke protests on this day, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was an assembly in the middle of the day in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats languages, including City Council member Jumaane williams, said: "McDonald's says it should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, said that "we should come together to support the fast-food employees, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity that everyone deserves New York!."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
But only a few hundred people were on the ground, not all of which are in the fast-food industry, by far, in which tens of thousands of people working in New York.
It is still not clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize the masses.

"The brain can outwit Haemochromatosis only so far."
The supporters of modern technologies popular topic of augmented reality is perceived in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first showcased in the summer at its annual conference a working model, in November, was then known that Microsoft had applied for a patent.
In the interview with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram izadi, is clear, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
It makes it possible to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual space.
- you just please describe their research group, which operates.
- we are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, want to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, the race is largely stuck in the phase that work with pixels on flat screens, which sometimes.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and predict the radical changes this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console generation sensors and a step forward, and today is sold without any Xbox generation, since all the interested in motion control.
- what awaits us in the future?
The new generation - although the interaction on a physical level, much is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been decided.
We are trying to change that work on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We must let the computer world in our physical world and make them more intelligible.
It is not only necessary but that the user, but also its surroundings.
Then we could add to the real world much easier by virtual objects.
First and foremost we should be Conserva bescheuerten virtual reality helmets.
- what do you think about language control?
It is popular, but it is not overvalued?
- it is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions of privacy, because it is not always inform all others about his actions and intentions.
Virtually every kind of interaction with computers, but each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the area of control of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and tight, experimenting with sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but from a bracelet Registerd the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively high, but in theory could be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
But, on the whole, however, the future belongs to the joint management types, for example, gestures and language.
- like that?
- we would ask me, for example, to offer these Sprudeldose?
They say it and at the same time Deuten.
- Normally I say it simply.
- oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- that is, they want the user adapts to what can make a machine at the time and what is not?
- not necessarily, but there is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we need to be working in the next time, especially in the development of new types of sensors that allow it to collect comments from people.
For example, laser sensors in depth because they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
- which claims it from its work with the Xbox generation sensors on modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, deep or something else?
The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8-megapixel with a speed of 1000 fps were not bad.
But the main thing is not the pipeline itself, but the quality and the depth of the matrix.
So are all current technologies are not good enough, because the developers of the algorithms more work.
It must not only the resolution along the X and the Y, but also along the z-axis are taken into account.
The speed and the number of frames per second are important.
The movements of the people are very dynamic and open are the current 30 fps especially for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a lot by now with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touching control and with more frames per second.
- the number of cameras should not be increased?
The new generation - is currently working with three cameras, "one of them, in fact, and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object deep.
More cameras could solve the problem...
Or the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful generation would be a flexible, similar to the system in which we could play with various kamera tendencies to see how that helps us in the three-dimensional investigation of a position.
- if I remember correctly, Microsoft in contrast to Google his glasses, not the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality glasses on a daily basis, the best prospects?
Of course, it is not pleasant to stop a smartphone in the hand, but I think the neatest variant would be a "temporary" extended reality, in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone,
The lens is a personal gadget, and therein lies its strength (private can only see it), but also its weakness, because an enlarged reality through glasses prevented that they can work together with other virtual objects.
- let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortals.
There is a problem, pointing to the critics of this idea: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing!
What answers your group wants to be at this point?
I am in my lectures often assume that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is the use of second-hand as something unusual projection surface.
It takes pressure.
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" something tangible, for example the interference of some grassroots ultrasound beams at a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling, but at the moment there is, as someone who created these fallen over the knuckles.
There are tapes for the wrist, which affect the Nervenendungen in the fingers, it is also a potential direction.
- you have tried to outfox the brain?
Thinking that it feels it what it should be, if it sees something?
- it is a good idea, so we tried it yet.
Here is another issue we will have to fight for a long time, namely, a man who is physically in a closed room to believe, he instead in an open, virtually infinite space; we have been working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms, as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only dream, and we still have many years of work.
That is the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive: for researchers on many issues, we are only at the beginning.

My own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde," which is dedicated to city residents who form the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the elite list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene that go beyond the borders of the city, and are often recognition in Europe without being in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of the extravagant artists Rosbalt Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded, dressed in red, the one time at the Russian Museum, the summer garden, a time when scene meetings or at openings.
Wherever issued the images of Kirill Miller, attracting large crowds.
Kirill Miller has created one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists, the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures up by his presence on the road to his fellow citizens in the face and a smile at you for good mood.
He recently grabbed a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg, summertime for difficult role in terms of his life, his philosophy and his image finally felt ready.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
The company calls anything that deviates from the norm, Greyboard aggression and bad behavior.
I want to get through my provocations with the people in the conversation.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the meeting.
- When Did you know that you have to become a painter?
- at an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Newskij, my work was issued.
I realized that I have to go down this road.
Then the time of old-free, but not officially recognised Dolmu then went to an end, and new and free Dolmu as I was incomprehensible.
I am friends with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; the result was "Rachmaninow" and then once was.
It takes me to the theater to the fashion, music, except for all the literature.
- all united in your kind clinic... - it was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best new artist should gather.
In 1995, I took a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and then there were up to the renovation, a club for artistic Musikalisch Boheme, the House of Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: name., tequilajazzz, and I remember how string with his project "Ucho -Van Goga."
Cord and his friends sang simple songs to the play-back, wore tight shirts and also the hottest composer Igor Wdowin today.
As the group began to play live, was from her "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the fundamentals he learned from us.
Even the gallery "d 137" or the club "griboedov" have their origin in the Art Clinic.
There, our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, there have been in the press, a poll, when it came to the award "personalities of our city."
I won in the category of "artist of the year," and I have reached the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times, according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In today's world it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, to make a cultural contribution.
- your work have a distinct style.
- many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly the accuracy and clarity of thought.
I will have an exhibition with the theme of "the Russian Museum as clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be so.
In a clown that blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world by writing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone looks at the clothes and focuses on the outside, not the inside of the people.
But perhaps we should not give people a hand, but should he spit in the face.
The deception will disappear by the disguise.
Recently, we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- commercial art can also be beautiful?
Today, commercial art should be careful and considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
In the past, people were large groups: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to all.
I am not one hundred dollar note, which falls each.
Now you need to consider thee, whom thou shalt case.
Now, every cult star about 100 supporters.
- to the performances of Stas Michailow Vollkommen but several thousand!
- to women who have abandoned him sexually, the social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted these pictures, which hung in a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images, which are usually only at the end of their careers.
Today, there are often Misunderstanding.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty rejected time and money.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill, what is lacking Petersburg?
- good cultural experts.
They say: servant of the culture.
But not all of you can deal with culture.
The real Tzars, it was different, because the Tzars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what that might be, but experts will be blocked the way, as it requires hochrangigerer experts to assess the former right and you open the way.
Now only one's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that you have to say that they do not all contemporary art and some other museums therefore Dolmu.
- What is for you Petersburg?
Petersburg - is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones art can only grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers and readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many people who are curious - the exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art needs to be modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants, the city of St. Petersburg

Birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with earth residents on board to find a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the important question of how we can continue our plants in weightlessness or on the planet?
There are many choices, in my opinion, no.
De facto, there are only two real planet that we could live at least hypothetical.
"Namely Mars and Venus," the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin says.
While the conditions on Mars are comparatively, there is life on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in other words, all possible.
The question of reproduction in the all the researchers treated first with regard to the flora.
Already a half-century before experiments were conducted with plants.
The fourth generation of in-orbit bred peas difference is not in the least of the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, specifically from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study the effect of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It has become a normal chicks.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chickens must stop; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," the director of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Vladimir Sychew explained.
Without a solid surface then precipitated the chicks.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and loud.
Then they died four days later.
"Twice we were hatching chicks and then the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in all.
The last breeding kennel with animals flew 16 years in orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
There are, however, will be the "only" Bion homosexual species.
It was an experiment with rats that were already sent fertilized.
In principle, was found nothing special.
"That was the bio-satellites, but again there was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," Vladimir Sychew noted.
After landing the space rats got offspring.
The issue of reproductive directly in space could not be solved before.
The task is difficult.
Animals which will travel from their natural habitat can't just follow their reproduction.
In contrast to animals in the human could in principle.
Homo sapiens is too abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women fly for 50 years.
It was the biggest risk for Tereshkova.
The most valuable asset, which owns the humanity of the female body.
The gull flew away, and no one on earth could answer the following question: survives the space flight?
They will be able to bring a child into this world?
"After all, nobody answered this question," space veteran's Watschnadse says.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan nikolajew was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which was twice in orbit, and even some work outside the space vehicle, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have only very few cosmonaut after long flights, in which everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," cosmonaut Valery Poljakow hero, hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation concludes.
And yet, humanity needs to look for new ways of biotechnology, the radiation protection and creating artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in the centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of flux the cosmonauts win routine for work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as a pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is, as the small Ichtyander would testify that life in the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get more water.
In principle, this is logical, since crime from birth to the first swimming just over two weeks.
"This is too little time to forget about something," baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa says.
While the weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman cannot happen without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness is the belly and Beckenmuskulatur enormously fast return and with the ability to squeeze the child.
Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could, for example, be held in a Spezialkammer to squeeze the child.
"But what happens then?," the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow says.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
To feel without the natural attraction, the body cannot form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in orbit to training as an adult in a suit.
It will simply be the absence, which is of vital importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment will mean that we are going to launch a behinderten, a completely unadapted people to the world," the head of the ethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Igor Pestow, predicts.
So far, the birth of children in the world all is just a theory.
At some point, but it becomes a reality, if the inhabitants of the earth to break into their space ships to a distant planet, which is a home for her in the all-born offspring.

Nkú chief: control of the Black system failed due to the fault of the policy.
The Czech Republic has in connection with public contracts on good control bodies and adequate laws, however, is in its application.
In the interview for Aktuálne.cz Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úrad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala says so.
"A law is never completely, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that this is not the case," Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar outcome is also seems to be a common control by Czech and German investigators.
The practice as a negative example he brings the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Necas to the so-called "black system."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass the entrepreneurs with controls - the system now is banned or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, but the government does not come easy chair, and hinder the Control Board, whose duty is to control the application of the law is, in his work," said Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other.
What was it?
It is a parallel review we started about two years ago.
Put simply, is that the European legislative determines how to handle public contracts to build the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this, we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, are the laws we are perhaps even more "rigorous and perfect," but the actual application in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to create new and more detailed rules. You must also deal with the actual implementation of the law.
How can you help the project? What emerges from this project?
Such a joint control could help that we constantly strive to improve laws and the lowering of thresholds and rebalancing if this obviously is not very positive.
Economic means to purchase one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and to exclude illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be that we put the system in this way only with excessive "paperwork," and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher.
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
What the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the Federal Audit NKÚ, which is similar to us and also has a college, which is basically just a little different but work both authorities.
The powers are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is, however, a federal state, which means that there are these courts in individual states - that is the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only monitor federal funding, which is our state funds.
Public funds that are managed in the counties and municipalities, control of the country's courts are there.
What the German legislation, is easier than ours?
In general, I would compare this without specific information only ungern. Nevertheless Germany is, in some ways, often referred to as a model, but you cannot say that Germany is better.
The fact that the inspectors are better?
That is not, but as I said, I don't like comparisons.
This is to say that even those countries that are a model for us, will also have to deal with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, isn't it?
What the Czech legislation, which was important for their authority, the revision of public procurement law, you already feel any impact?
Given that this novel is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests.
Since our controls are in place, you have to expect a certain delay.
We feel so far more impact in preparation for future inspections, so we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and examined with this nearly 14,000 public contracts and analyzed - here are the changes impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of calls were MODIFIES.
You can see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with another layer of bureaucracy?
I think that this bill is a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, it may occur, the problem is that the rules are "strict" and can no longer be respected.
Under the previous rules are a Proofreading unterzogenen people against the winner (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council accountable, so that any breach of contract law is tantamount to violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it useful, however, to make the law even tougher?
I do not believe that in this way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack the system and abuse, and not punish those who committed an error that has an impact on the real decision-making.
Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
First, let's say, what is not.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother with the controls of the so-called "black" - what exactly does this mean?
The black system has now been banned or allowed?
A bill must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, but the government does not come easy chair, and hinder the Control Board, whose duty is to control the application of the law is, in his work.
He said: "we can change the law and allow the matter," but he could not say that we behave as if nothing would.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid will be excluded solely because of procedural irregularities.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied right - and that is what is missing from us, I think.

Šimon Ornest: on our concerts we want to build up positive energy.
What do you think that the world should take place in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster messages that we are so happy to jump to humans.
With our band The tap tap we make us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or to prevent the world.
In December, they also create a unique project with three concerts against the world.
You can imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we plan to two years.
We want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for the 21st December at 11: 10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, from 9: 00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends.
This idea came from whom?
Originally from me, then we have to flesh out the idea, together with our graficdesigner Honza Augusta.
We don't want to just collect sufficient positive energy to prevent the world, but we like to think along with the public about the state of the world once we pass on to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the world, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can also support.
The band The tap tap has taken together with other performers also called the anthem against the world with the title "doomsday is."
Even today, the national anthem on YouTube is very popular. It will be performed at the charity concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything goes according to plan, and the world is not taking place...
The anthem should be sung by all the performers on all three concerts at the same time.
Also, the hymns are -bertragen together in a direct circuit of the Czech television live.
The text of the anthem of the company HANÁK, who also played the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also sings with Xindl X...
How did you get to work with two?
We will also cooperate with other leading figures in the Czech culture scene, that we realize many charity events and concerts.
We are trying to involve us, these people in our projects.
It was clear that the majority of them are interested in cooperation with us, and have fun.
The purpose of the proceeds from the concerts will benefit against the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre.This Studeo, we are already working six years together with the tap in the jedlicka Institute.
The students of jedlicka Institute will be cared for by editors that help you with various leisure activities.
Since the students do not have the resources to search for the editors, we want to help you in this way.
In the context of the completion of the jedlicka Institute, a private building in which we draw with this project.
At every concert a number of groups and performers.
According to what criteria they have chosen this?
We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, China ucitelé, support lesbiens, Illustratosphere occur with Dan Czech, the tap tap, Marián Bango and JIRÍ Suchý.
Everything else you can find on the internet page www.kpks.cz.
Similar "big events" are also planned for the future?
In May, we stand for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to join in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States, this would also like to combine with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans are not just small, thus far, they have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The TAP is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
As they deal with this logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. We must also, of course, with many instrument suitcases and other Lugage...
Nonetheless, it has always worked without problems, CSA and British Airways have always been very good to us that sometimes I wonder sometimes.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By their foreign travel, so you have a comparison, as it did in the individual countries with accessibility looks, how to deal with people with disabilities
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than us, we were just in Russia that witnesses in the East is still in its infancy.
Vis-à-vis Prague Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even there, of course, is that it leaves a wheelchair user, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are clubs that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things on which we depend is...
It is important to note, however, that an improvement in the situation still depends on the efforts of the people affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities move independently in a public space, the museum can use toilets, etc.
But it is not customary for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in the public arena, we are involved with the band The Tap Tap are slightly ahead of the West.
In respect of the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when the great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks, things will really start to change.
So far, these are only cases of particular desire strong personalities.
The TAP is currently very popular. But if we take a couple of years back: what was your motivation in 1998 to start a band?
Then I started as a supervisor in the jedlicka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something.
And since I am a musician and saxophone games I founded together with a colleague, a music AG.
Oh, and by the time is that, as our moderator to say láa Angelovic, tended to get a little out of control (laughs).
The band was known, but only in the last few years, and I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation helped with well-known singers; we also have also begun to advertise for us.
We become aware that if you are doing something and to the outside, this is not your performance in a way that does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding we can afford überdies good editors, high-tech equipment and gapahuk.
It was their goal, with the tap tap so far?
From the beginning, I have sensed the potential that we can go about things differently.
Show business is now often copied one another.
That is on its way, because everything Logicamente new is viewed with caution and accepted until some time later.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of the audience usually is, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because no lonely and abandoned Przemyslowego are people with disabilities, and we would regret.
There are people who can live a normal life and develop, if you have the funds to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities does something, this is not just for themselves, but for the whole society.
It was for this success, that you are a strong leader, as we hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise on many things, and also needs a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you then have to find that they have tested twice a week, to undertake preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then quickly extinguished the enthusiasm among many.
So it works but everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
Tap tap Receptionisten currently has 20 members.
How many of those were from the outset, since 1998?
Only one: láa Angelovic.
We are an open group. The people come and go, but this is something we cannot avoid.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.
Will be held the day before the predicted doomsday, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues are: incheba Arena, Prague and Brno / Fléda Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians.
All three venues will be connected to the final circuit via live together and it sounds a common interpretation of the anthem "doomsday," the band The tap tap.
The concert is to raise the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional disabled education center that is to be created under the name STUDEO in jedlicka Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years for free tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.

Poland and the space.
Last week Poland was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the twentieth member of this space agency. Poland is the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects.
Poland's path to space began much earlier, however.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts in the space, but they were not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Academy, where the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "entrance to the Space Exploration."
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience cold, however, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "at the entrance to the Space Exploration" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie Andr- Louis Hirsch and donated Prix rep Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of space was honored by the fact that one of the crater was named on the side of the moon erdabgewandten after him.
In 1925, a rail trolley was built in Poland, for a rocket propulsion was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project, remained unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the missile would be used to start or stop the trolley.
The details come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish Outpour began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research, the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia resulted in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents that the research was reached in the stage of practical tests.
The research, however, has been suspended by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the ING appeared in the press Rohozinski. On the draft of a photoelectric hunting missile, and the following year was the work of "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna Aquest rakietobomba be the author's" Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealing with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects have been coordinated with the military use of missile technology from the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, but his work was finished by the start of the war.
Other items to the space appear after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is in 1954 in the November issue of the journal problemy, in the four major articles of the space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of an aerospace company.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.
At its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA sought accession to the 1951-based International Federation for space, and indeed the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956 full member.
The following year the first PTA, presiding omnicki Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) was, vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA was instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1 was completed in 1957, the first flight took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A, was built in 1959, and flight tests began in the Bledowska Desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 meters long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should be in a position to make real scientific work - the missile RM-34 should at an altitude of up to 14.5 km and reach for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, the further development has been discontinued.
In the first missiles of the type RM Meteor 1 missile was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as Zweistufenrakete, their total length fraud 510 cm and start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1b and -1c) which differed from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The meteor 1A rocket had a room with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1b about 0.34 liters and meteor-1C about 0.62 per litre.
The maximum altitude fraud in all three types, 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 missile was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Also worthy of the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland participated in the framework of the programme Interkosmos space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was second after the Czechs Vladimír Conditii Interkosmonaut.

The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on charitable work.
That decision provoked a lively debate among the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, with rampant financial speculation, hand in hand.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions.
Under this concept of a state is to understand where the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper imported goods in the economic competition, offers the competition "to seize a larger share of the market and to increase its profits.
In a large-scale that for most companies to move their production abroad or to purchase cheap, or to abandon their business, but the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labor costs.
Since the private capital has no social responsibility, and thus no responsibility for it caused by unemployment, the rising government spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, to be replaced by the overall social economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this stage.
The brutal practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce the social level of their own people and thus artificially to lure foreign capital into the country.
In other words: the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly applicable law changes.
The objective of these measures is to impose its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is due to economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by reducing workers' rights.
The result is a growing poverty and increasing gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are a few years ago public food outlets for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is in the millions.
In the wake of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy are regularly to cases in which workers will receive a wage so low that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of the German federal employees auxiliary staff.
The austerity measures virtually all of the EU's southern states will certainly be in the same state, where the people are obliged under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or darben for a pittance on the fringes of society, and to hope that eventually will go private investment capital in the country.
Here is the question of where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty of a country moving in the other; or the capital from remains the same, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa for the workers at a fraction of the wages of work.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the government should not be involved with capital on its own economy, and that a planned economy will lead to economic disaster.
Private capital narrowly insists on its position that the state cannot interfere in the economy.
But then we have to ask whether the private capital the policy and the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even draws.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, a legislative, in which everything, but nothing is almost criminally punishable by law.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department of Finance instructed private, dense with industry interdependent law firms with the preparation of draft legislation.
These bills will be passed in the Bundestag.
All the violence comes not from the people, from the western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
The Liberal Democrats currently Evidently Council quickly in a situation as you appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey 'describes: "the state was for a long time in the fall, and the offices were filled with violence.
Against soft money through illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.
The corruption grown incontinent, and the people have purchased went to vote in the elections... "" people with character applied for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul... "" really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine is in this difficult situation an autocracy, and that a strong man should be chosen... "Appian thought while at Pompey, but the strong man Caesar, which replaced the democracy permanently by the dictatorship was eventually.
As it turns out, is based in today's society, as well as in the antiquity of the ruthless preference of his own advantage, not paying attention to overall social interests.
Private capital is already, by its very nature, is not in a position to identify and implement the benefit of the whole of society.
The result, now as then, is an unparalleled decadence of elites who is not in the slightest of in-depth reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we need to look at the reckless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current state of the downfall of the regime can be seen in favor of liberal democracies as some pause, in the next round already looms.
Especially appalling is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are already today, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution, or at least not permanent.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to put the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore system.
The only solution is to increase targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory of chaos.
... "That nothing comes from violence, or ever could," Sting sings in the song fragile, whose main verse reads in the chorus: "... So that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons wanted no wars, there would be no," the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild family's reputation, in 1849
After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a host of reactions.
The stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the state of Israel, the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist.
I would not write at this point about who these recurring waves and who is guilty of killing victims; at the end of the current residents were born in Israel, including the self-rule areas in the current political situation and saw the start of the violence itself.
What is important is to give readers the behind-the-scenes look, the look of who owns 95 years of tension (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small parcels of land are mainly in the Middle East.
My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding, who or what group of people played a major role in the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can make an Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it really always these figures were themselves that certain steps independently, or whether someone was behind her throne, which drew their actions on a vorbestimmtes goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of fewer individual, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not been created within the life span of a generation.
Under this astronomical stings a rich families, which could be described as the head of the octopus (I do not know whether someone is about you, but I am not) - the Rothschilds.
Much will not be written about them.
Understandably,.
The first press agency (Reuters) was from the Rothschilds in the 1890s bought, to prevent the link your name with high criminal deeds, whose background is consolidating its power, the proliferation of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are not part of the central banks, they lead wars or equip itself on this (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia, in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who has ever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began handing out during the civil war, its own (read: state) notes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to publish their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis MC Fadden was poisoned in 1936, when he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to free three world wars by Albert pik, a Masonic of the 33rd and the highest level of knowledge.
The first war to eliminate the goal, the big royalist state of Europe, through the second war, in particular, the colonial power Britain should be broken, and the third is to reduce the world's population on about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their facilities and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the Forefield), and finally to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (Order from Chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the Fed, so that crises such as those of you in 1907 Repeating triggered. "
After it was able to resolve them by the assassination of the Hapsburg heir to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the first world war, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar empire was the war no longer needed), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria-Hungary.
To make the second world war easier, the bankers could spark created by the policy a latent conflict situation by occupied Germany with huge war reparations; thus, they created the condition of impoverished masses, so they had to cheer the German only a sufficiently strong leader who named the culprits and simple solutions offered; another factor was the creation of a multi-ethnic state Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take the function of a fifth column, and also began to stir up the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, which sought a branch on the establishment of a state for the Jews, as at the historic area of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration said the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was created to first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second world war broke out, and whether the chain of Hitler general- Elegancia riss that it comply with the international bankers had initially, or if everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just like the war reparations against Germany is preparing the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the third world war.
If it is to succeed, the international bankers to unleash this war, is similar to the Jewish people during the Second World War to the victims in the front line of battle, this time with the Arab and Muslim nations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how sharp the people of supporters and opponents of Israel under parts).
Who is guilty and who was the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where unfair only unjust in an endless spiral of violence, but at the beginning of the greed and their pursuit of global power?
We must distinguish between the people of Israel and its leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates for the election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism vulnerable, international bankers loyal dutiful politician is doing everything possible to ensure that failed to ignite a war with Iran, which could result in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), soon became a global conflict, and it could be because of the scrutiny of Iran on the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil supplies, to the deterioration of the global economy.
In which light because the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: "the only thing we need is an over-arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In its presentation of the new world order is one of the masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn baby at birth, a chip implanted to subjugate the essence of total control.
"And it is that small and large, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants of all time is a signal to your right hand or on your forehead that nobody can buy or sell, he said, because the time is the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is a wisdom, who has to think of the number of the beast.
Because it is a human number, its number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig. "

The film Argo: if the worst is that Hollywood call
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which maintained over the decades, the patronage of his regime.
For the US government, there was no positive way out of this situation, they could not afford to raise the Shah on board, which damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not in a position to enforce in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure of the violent attempt the hostages were only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations had been conveyed by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home caused a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat by Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the film director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the United States a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy employees.
This came after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA has succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; an extravagant story to cover their true identity helped them - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, supposedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction movie.
Combining the genres
The experts for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the cooperation of Hollywood.
The camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in trade magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but also a so-called "Bob Movie," the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs will be shown, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which ironically and repositionings Vollkommen so easily.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table in the office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is with this movie a remarkable start to his career.
From a losing a respected actor and director has become, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third feature film, the thriller not childsplay (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without gnade (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, is not in the director's native Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that contrasted with the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada. "
The best scenes in the movie play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the entrance to sequence the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, and conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when the story somewhere.
Affleck achieved a similar effect with his team with fictional scenes (the wrong film in a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much in too many places
The director also has had to deal with that history is not many in the cinematic sense exciting scenes.
He has been working with the little but quite successful, sometimes after helping the reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis averted at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or even the chase on the runway seem contrived something).
The weakness of Argo is to have its overly broad distribution, which is driven by the need to act to show too many places too much.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood Biofrühstück Baillon, although their figures were worthy but more space, and they are in the film is far from alone.
Afflecks film to lose traction. It is a movie that you watch with some interest and can goutieren the design and a thriller from the 1970s retro-style.
However, he has inspired enthusiasm.
As a reminder of today are in some way living piece of history and as proof of how excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, is it enough, however.

Guidelines for inflating of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com calls out of an annual survey on the oddest of bank charges, has decided this year to hold the competition "absurd Pengguna regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"On this idea brought us the recently by the European Union's plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of the large European companies," Patrik, who cares about the history of the organisation of the poll, told the newspaper právo.
Among the nominees absurdities, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, the women with life-insurance companies an advantage, because they represent for the insurance companies objectively less risk.
"More incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said history.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol fuel, which is in its wake, naturschädigend FUTHERMORE banning the reliable mercury thermometers, just because they have a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive to the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even a ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long.
The EU decides apparatus under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule will be represented by one or several member countries (Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to veto threat with the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas the highest trade in the EU must be at least 14 inches long and no "curvature anomaly" must have.
The European Commission defended themselves with the argument that they harmonisiere only the fragmented national standards that would impede the trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries already with the suggestion that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation of the past year, according to balloons on sale will be equipped with the note that children under eight years are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU berief to an American study, the balloons are the leading cause of death for the suffocation deaths of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also some odd ideas at home.
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official function in the EU must not be used because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, the name Macedonia and must instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) say.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU set the Hoechstvolumen on food supplies, which was located on the day of our EU accession on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the volume for canned mushrooms, a large fine Wofür hanging over us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive the money that they have no sea, or from the idea to provide funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are still at a disadvantage that we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU refund, "said in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
He argued that the grain harvest was very high and overcrowded government camps as a result of the so-called intervention purchases goods.
Since the Czech Republic is another way to sea ports, according to the heart of the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far, that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding offered the communities of the Ministry of Regional Development, under the leadership of Prime Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU) and, in particular, should be earmarked for the establishment of aid money to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are in the member countries, the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and deserves this efficiency and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, more recognition.
A more serious problem is the opinion of experts tend the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, which were imposed in the budget negotiations by individual member countries.
Emotions aroused by the fact that in Germany, the Czech Republic, similar to other member countries in Brussels must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic was able to defend, under a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "olomoucké tvaružky," the national rum (Tuzemský rum), which in our tradition goes back to the 19th century, our manufacturers have had to rename, however, in "Tuzemák."
The name rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of the EU's registered products of Karlovy Vary, biscuits and carp from pohorelice Trebon, or even more hops in the company of the world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or prosciutto di Parma.
With an EU trademark can because the Pardubicer gingerbread or Horicer breasts roles.

"The people want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr Senator, how does one get the idea to run for the office of president?
I am not talking about being a senator or president.
If it would work in our country without problems, I would stand anywhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free, be increased during the people's taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
If I see something I don't like it, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
In the Senate, they have managed, and then straight on the road to the castle.
They will not return to their constituents back?
I said to myself the whole time that I am going to take the fight to the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later I made it and said that I shall be a candidate for the office of president, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my vision.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
But the problem is not only that we as a people shouting in the pub and in front of the television, but anyone who wants to make a difference down.
The media who want to steal the credit, and the lies to confuse the freedom of speech with freedom.
For me, it was claimed, for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant of JIRÍ Paroubek.
We are talking about their visions.
The battle for the castle you have included the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retroactive asset declarations about 20 million kronor.
To do so, you need to change the law.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and it could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, this will be rejected, and on the population.
As an independent party loser I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of any party that can do what is best for our country.
Do they see themselves as human in politics rather right or left?
From Czech perspective, it seems to me that the more people see me.
For me, this right-to-left thinking, but it is totally irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we continue to come.
I am not talking about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right; I want to unite the people.
I am always publicly any good solution, even if these KSCM or of the ODS, and I will speak out against bad ideas.
You do not like it when someone described them as populists.
But it's not confirmed by what you just said?
If you are in a company, a business plan, then you will have a great goal and a vision.
And that you want to approach.
You can call it as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world, or they have been discussed by experts.
But without support in the House, you still have only keywords.
And so, they will be in the long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you just long enough with the speeches, people will be able to push through, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
And to try to convince politicians, journalists and the general public, to bring them to our side, to achieve these goals.
As president, it is not a problem for me to call on the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to anchor the Materialistic and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if the aforementioned would then have to say why they oppose it.
A strong personality, highlighting abuses can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, who was a credit to the public pressure.
I can say categorically that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy, I have only just begun and try to find my program for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the things themselves, and if it doesn't work, then I go in six years in the private sector.
It sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I do nothing; therefore, I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether you do not want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with radim urzdzeniach Jancura, however, rejected due to overwork.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová that uncovered the fraud in the trade, with light heating oil.
My candidacy, I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters went to the polls, not at all, and those who are gone, have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are now only two independent.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision for the direct election of mayors and district chief men.
You think about setting up your own party?
I have been thinking about that, because I don't have time to review the past every potential party member, and that it does not have the money to do so.
I have no money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000.
They have no money?
You talk about financial statements, what would your?
I value my private assets to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is about 10 million value, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a superb Škodu, about a million value. And then I still have a few million in the bank account.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he drove in a car, Galant to women and, at the same time it was fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that they want to change the Republic, but your own money, you don't want to invest in it.
This is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I do about debt?
I have already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors have shown that my program does not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will be covered basically through my salary as a senator.
But the senator salary alone, I could not live; so I could be my son, not the English school finance costs 30,000 per month.
If I wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
They are more than entrepreneurs to have their livelihoods?
They said that they will not go back to these activities?
But that is not linked to the level of salary.
As promised, I pulled my activities.
So, for example, is my deputy in the spring, managing director of the travel agencies.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan rescues the Republic.
But I must however life of something.
Monthly income on which they were used as an entrepreneur?
Some 200,000 to 400,000, and it remains so.
As President, I would put my activities, however.

The architects MVRDV proof that the real adventure, not only in the head - for example spijkenisse and the newly-created "- 2 photos
"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see them again," said Lisette Verhaig Passantin says, on the edge of the road.
And, Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby major operating says: "it is beautiful, but already, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man is still at one of these old-style libraries, or?
Spijkenisse tiesnavou needy Sleepingbag, a little town on the outskirts of Rotterdam, strange record holder.
The 80,000 residents' education has the lowest rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid, we decided a few years ago, contribute to the general education and to reduce the seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro, seem pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the education campaign.
And so the city fathers recognized that there is only one way to be the statistic Mr: a library needs.
, winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of the great bold bar graphs and producer of funny, often cynical buildings took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared to the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under my arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury still looked puzzled and shoulders, wincing Esspecially Freche Maas of his exquisite gifts to the size of a pyramid and founded an actionist ended his speech with the words: "dear municipality."
It is, therefore, my proposal for the mountain of books spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million mountain is built up.
He is part of a revitalization project, including garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few are living and adjacent row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, "the second prize was awarded the" Best Library of NL 2012. "
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
So the faceless town retort that offer had not so far more than a post-modern peša and a stunned ugly Hall, behind its white walls, one could be inclined to suspect a Molkereifabrik, a piece of contemporary architecture is richer.
Above all, however, has now spijkenisse on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book.
The first impression: books Eldorado under glass.
It is true that there is an elevator that leads through the mountains, but the real joy and read the fußläufigen climb up the topography.
The Rundum glazed interior is bright and clear, and the elegant streetlights burned Klinkerboden unequivocally speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for park bench, dog and soccer-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle of a large, dark space, which is usually ugly and impersonal is winy Maas says."
We have asked the classic room configuration on its head and read by enclosing the area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the books: this is used in the middle office, library, the Internet Chess Club, environmental and clean house.
A special treat is the black bookshelves, time, time parapet wall Cowling, rose close countries.
Look, feel and smell.
Even hardbitten architects, engineers and construction material and the unknown whether shake of the head.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality spijkenisse said, at the request of the standard.
And so we have encountered in a farming friesländischen one day on a waste product from agriculture.
For many years we have used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a Milli meters thin plastic woven as the root surface.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin KROME- holds a two seasons, then it is ripe for the rubbish bins.
For the library the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities to four inches thick plates.
Under heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that smells a little after new cars and a little after athletic footwear.
After 105 stufen has reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journeys in the cafe will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in the literature Mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this is in spite of the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.
Heated and chilled with geothermal energy.
Although the books mountain is under a glass of fall, the sun itself appears only briefly on sunny days in the interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder available across the glass facade, serve as shadows and catch a large part of the sun's rays.
The climate is very pleasant.
The rest fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry already ventured into the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM Cynthia Bogarde, which she described as "the Boekenberg Spijkenisses overdue soul."
The reason: the opening a few weeks every resident has been invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the time being, so that should be filled again the optical gaps in the not-yet-fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has taken root.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," architect winy Maas says.
"I think that thanks to our invitation each now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
This is the pinnacle of Menyelisihi MVRDV who are called in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse has literary history.
So young and uneducated they may be.
This is a starting point for identity.

Szabo: "German must play a greater role."
Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine abstained.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then to Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Germany must now be given its special relationship with Israel but cautious.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, as was to set up a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, enforced by NATO.
Germany will find it difficult to take on important international issues a clear position?
Yes, it's true.
This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy from a policy, which has been managed by the United States, a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The German is therefore find themselves trapped in the middle.
It is expected that you play a more independent role, but they are not.
I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy it from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent from those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, in other words from the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have had influence on the attitude of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote at the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be cautious, the public, but also to the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, which plays a role.
But I would not want to attach a lot of weight, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in German reections.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by focusing on major decisions, abstained in the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe, and even in the US there is great sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany is a game that even some respect.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The US, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite sympathetic to the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can, of course, does not represent the position publicly.
I believe that the real differences are not always as they appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is by no means an audience of Netanyahu's policy.
Germany will find it hard to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the main partner in the EU, on the other side?
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case now.
So they can't be part of a broader line and must instead expedite things from their own position.
This is precisely the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even for the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the German clear is that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as a major international player, will play a key role in Germany at all?
Like Germany or the leadership still difficult?
Germany is still not accustomed, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time when Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German feelings.
This makes it the German.
This is the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics, from the EU fills the vacuum at the moment but not who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular, c'est la vie!

"Trademark protection in China:" if Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
In China, where it officially registered designation, nothing to do with the company.
However, as long as it enjoys protection actions, such as the actual name.
And even then it is not clear whether they will be proven right.
"It will be more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in copyright violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The copying a few additional letters enough so that they must register their trademarks.
As Lu Gucci, Prada will be simply from Gucci-Prada Kny.
German companies are also copied legally in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Patt hole opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, there was a Chinese company that trademarks protect Zegna DF Puma, a name that is also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in the copy and the injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are multistory department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
Pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his clients, he goes against Chinese companies from the trademark office officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
For women, the fishing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any debt
"This is geschäftsschädigend, you have to fight it," Patt hole.
"The brand will be diluted, the only position disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries in the millions, especially on expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company clsa China is with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third-largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But DELETION dubious entries in the commercial register are difficult to achieve and go in the money.
Up to nine years, the proceedings drag, with uncertain results.
Patt hole reported cases in which the court rejected claims, because the name is reported to the long-term "market has become a reality."
If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money, because he injured his brand in China, stalemate hole says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases involving graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer SANY, the company, which recently took over the German concrete pump Bauer Preparare master.
The bottom line is that the Chinese must now use an emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer geely -ecstasy- used a blue and white logo, which recalled BMW; the dispute was resolved, geely had to change it.
The fashion maker Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which caused the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The trademark office in Beijing CTMO admits that there were 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
In the past year, but it was returned by the "emergency situation in the workflow to normality."
So the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure was dropped by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have completed it, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, waiting in the office still 81.500 appeals to completion.
In contrast to deal
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications received by the CTMO trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record, meant that China would lead to the tenth consecutive year, the list of new registrations in all over the world, the authority.
That holds true even for the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 1.8 billion yuan had been taken on charges.
Simplified, which means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To address it costs a lot, as in the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese Plagiator.
The Germans were able to ensure that its illegal manufacturing imitation of motor vehicle parts was dug.
But he continues to be followers of the Chinese rights to the brand.
You have failed, because the family name in Germany could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical specialities says in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO rejected the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two instances of Freudenberg got it right, but the process opponents continue fighting until today.
We have to be careful award
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the process is very time-consuming, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could not quantify the company archives have even seen a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to the settlement.
"That shows how much there is," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East, even threatening to spill back to Europe.
Then, if there is imitators vulnerable brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he was able to avert the registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler award.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole Council German companies in dealings with China to be very careful.
It is not enough to international trademark rights to leave, but the fact that foreigners should "everything is worthy somehow, even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg under Chaiselongue in the last act of his trademark drama, then we would have to pay license fees for the other side's name Wentzler said.
Or we will be relegated to the segment of the market.

World AIDS Day: stamping, sing, help
The choir rehearse in Heidelberg imbongi - and AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
The story of a relationship that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the noise: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, Damenpumps and Herrenslipper search on the parquet floor the beat, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then press the voices of the singers Distention slowly - old, bass, tenor and soprano, and later.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, it almost from its plastic shoes when he brings together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg imbongi Choir rehearse a new song.
Of the 50 singers have come between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin until the house man.
"Om Obani is no easy, each choir voice has a different text and this in a very foreign tongue: Zulu, the will of 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and spoken in parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
There are about 34 million people infected with HIV, according to UNAIDS estimates, the program of the United Nations for the use of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
245000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni Voices for Africa, the group has found sponsors in Germany.
70 of them attending secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the children's school fees, a school uniform and a hot meal every day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means to Zulu storytellers or Lobpreiser.
The Bantu can speak fluent in this area, but no singing.
For almost ten years of a choir performs songs in this strange soft language and brings you back then, and also where they originally come from: in South Africa.
Since 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, that depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some in simple mud and straw huts, a majority of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents more, because they have succumbed to the virus.
In the world according to UNICEF Esitjeni reflected in the small, very Swaziland suffers: the highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy.
Circumcision, the male foreskin, reduce the risk of contagion has proven to be accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people of Swaziland's Immunschwäche virus to die with mid-thirty is not uncommon.
In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005, discovered the chorus of the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, where not only did it lack of parental care, but in particular: food, clothing, education.
Without a school in a poor country has a chance.
Initially, it was still the private individual to send for a few euros in the year a child to school and to allow him a hot meal a day.
But a year later, the association "Voices for Africa," the almost professionally since the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni founded the choir.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections.
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea Tripper ().
Frequent viral STI, humane Pappilomaviren Vaak, HIV or hepatitis is.
Crab and itch belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and Tripper, especially among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of Germany reported cases of syphilis transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In the heterosexual adults chlamydia infections, trichomonaden, Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren identifies common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexuals adults here is relatively small, about 20 percent of all new HIV infections in this group.
Among the young chlamydia infections occur far more frequently than other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of the cases involve young people between 15 and 25 years.
Here are also humane Pappilomaviren among young people.
As the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch Institute in 1697 diseases in 2001 at 3698 diseases in 2011, more than doubled.
The number of new HIV infections since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
The symptoms are pointing to a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints to urinate, discharge, Unterbauchschmerzen and blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100 percent protection.
As part of the pathogen of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infection and close physical contact.
As a result, experts recommend especially for frequently changing sex partners regular examinations.
Most of the STI diagnosed early can be cured and avoid late consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least, the fees, the ersingt Choir in all of Germany, things are coming together.
"We have already sent a total of about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni," Annette lennartz, the chairman of the association says.
In the village itself Zodwa dlamini managed a self-conscious and enforcement of strong women, the money from Germany.
They also worry that the orphans, well under one of the grandmothers.
The gogos, as the old women in Zulu, the base of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give you a roof over their head and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear every day, just in time for the school.
Anyone who has come to the house to protect Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid for by the association as well as the two cooks in the kitchen every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, "Voices for Africa" launched a Nähschule, built two Hühnerhäuser and organized jointly with the American Health Organisation PSI that many in the village have an HIV test.
This is not a foregone conclusion, because the disease is so obvious in the whole country, it is silent on the dead.
A king with 14 wives.
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," Annette lennartz says, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also the state-sanctioned life form that the virus has spread in recent decades so quickly.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus in the country.
Free condoms, there would be around every corner, Annette lennartz says, "but the rarely used.
The culture is very different - flesh to flesh. "
To promote cultural exchanges, travels the imbongi choir every two to three years through the South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many know at the southern tip of the black continent, from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white, the songs in a black language sing - so much recognition not only brings humor and joy, but has also been abgetrotzt some fierce border soldiers a few tears.
The journey will always Esitjeni, where the singer to visit their children.
Even if the small village on maps little place in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than known.
"After Esitjeni, as is the light," said the people there.
And if you return the 8733 kilometres, pounding the singers in the rehearsal room on the east, then lights there too.

Messenger: NASA Discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that Mercury ice exist on the planet.
The ice may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are some frozen water, as evidenced by three on Thursday in the journal "Science" published studies.
The probe Messenger have found evidence that the ice sheet is in the shadow of the permanently in the region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 cm and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water came from comets or asteroids that may also have embarked on the Mercury.
Nobody put the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon said.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 2 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.

Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei began a year later to the star.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes were growing - and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows all equal in the eyes of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Canarias telescopio on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone, the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Detriment of cheap construction: the telescope is already in his elevation angle - and in his limited mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high-earning power.
This is despite relatively low - namely diameter mirror - the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers to hear it all for alien signals.

In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, which is worthy of its name.
With its total four mirrors the telescope can also ensure its designed function within prescribed limits in the middle.
Also on the Chilean HACER Observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its main mirror to include a whopping 42 yards - and be set on nearly 1,000 mirror elements together.
With photos until 2018, however, is to be expected.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii was seen as the biggest in the world.
They offer two levels ever, with an average of 10 meters.

Also on the summit of Mauna Kea to a new, huge telescope with a mirror - an average of 30 meters.
It is here on an illustration.
The main impressions from all the space telescope Hubble delivers, however.
Since April 24, 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope search for extrasolar planets, particularly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011 was announced by NASA that 1,235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission began.
In the last launch preparations are documented on the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot until 2018 aboard a Ariane5 rocket into space.
The primary mirror of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope to search for light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data, as the Messenger circles far closer to the North Pole to the planet.
Radar measurements hingedeutet have for decades that there is on the ice.

In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.

A search in the country in the 97-year-old are still relatively young.
The trip through the mountains Talysch is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumpelt on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farm houses.
Everything is green and lush, one might think, you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of the border with Azerbaijan, Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, is not much, except that she speaks perfect English and Aserisch and is very durable.
Final stop is Lerik.
The small town flaunts powerfully to meeting the architecture of Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here to tread the directions from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku.
Of the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the vehicle to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the Eurovision song festival - and in the next year, we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only player in the world.
The Vita is about eight dozen Talyschen documented from the area, the older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years ago shows a child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov that should have become 169 years old.
However, there is a birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, pluca Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.
"It was born here in the region," he died in 1973, Fatulayeva explained.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years shows he is said to have a daughter.
Irali Müslümov has charged that at his age for a couple of decades?
But even Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Striking many hochaltrige people is also available in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "also in Sardinia life extremely many very old men."
Due to a lack of documentation was, however, no scientific proof of age, identity register.
Every day becherweise melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik achieve a remarkably often many age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why life here in the south of so many high-aged?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explained that with the specific genes of Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is the food.
But that it should be the food of Talyschen kalorienreiche HEALTHY should be so, especially meat, bread and milk products, many of which have daily drinking a glass of melted butter, from a nutritional point of view is not plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.

Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always eat only what came from their own station, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyew" took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange coming from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, driven by the father figure of the nation, ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no emergency in Azerbaijan.

The word "human rights" in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo, it seems, the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution with Sharia basis is controversial.
Egyptian President division with pathos.
We must make the transition.
"And that he will succeed is in my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all people, but especially to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.
So far, because they all hopelessly divided opposition in a confused, scared.
Fear of a god of the Nile State of Grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said Mohammed Morsi, almost excuse, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed his powers and extended to "save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD in American University of Southern California, really wants to save, as the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles, which were pushed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a late-night, 15-hour Parforceritt, some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also stated in the draft, the legal grounds on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will exploit the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least one new hinzugeführter Articels: in all matters relating the Sharia al-Azhar University, must be taken into account, the country's main Islamic institution with great power throughout the Sunni Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that the clergy, oversees the legislation, which de facto the disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule on the suppression of opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The state should also protect, it says in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote their morals and values. "
The law is so vague that state institutions could control with the help of this article, even the content of film art and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
No way, says the article menioneaz equality between men and women.
It prohibits another to insult the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy or to slander.
But what is an insult and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Equally dubious about the wording of the "insult to the people" is forbidden.
There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Open to interpretation, like so much in the draft, which Morsi will be put to the signature and presented to his words "very soon" the Egyptians to the referendum.
"The revolution has returned."
The opposition formed for weeks about the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the Charter to fall, even before it can enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," Hamdin Sabbahi Drittplatzierter, said of the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution "belong on the scrapheap of history."
Via short message service Twitter he accused supporters of Morsi's trying to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," the opposition persuade Yasser Said said.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brethren atoned is not yet," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Khaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they want to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to the counter-demonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the Nile River in Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis attended and shouting: "the people calling for the application of God's law."
They demanded by Morsi: "cleanse the country!" And protested: "the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for control of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, probably would have led to civil war.
Did not want to risk obviously Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft EU constitution as well as the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to be decided, the people at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
The word "human rights does not happen again."
Hafez Abu Saeda is said to be furious about this forced constitutional process that would actually have until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers, as they sat under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but for him because human rights are indivisible.
He was convicted, imprisoned, beaten.
"Now is not the word of human rights in the new constitution," he complained in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
Morsi power to extend all three powers in the state's lawyer had resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president put it," de facto suspended Saeda complained.
But without a democratic civil society organisations could not work.
Saeda feels alone, but also by the international community, which sees the ideological direction fight along the Nile, with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
A protestor in Tahrir warns: "your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."

Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but all over the world.
The secret to the success of the country might have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of mature cheeses.
One place you in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sports clothing.
And they leave a week.
As it is the smell of rakfisk nasenbetäubenden, one of the great delights of Norway.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which is fermented, it depends on how you would like to stink its fish - up to a year in water.
When the darkness comes in Norway on the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians to flock here in Fagernes, it is this, well, really very impressive specialty.
"You can eat it raw and provides it with a glass of aquavit," Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "rakfisk General" organized the festival says.
All around us people eat small fish cubes and make large quantities of alcohol.
"People don't like the Mansche aquavit more than the rakfisk," Harvard said.
The spirits can replace the smell.
I eat a few bites.
If it avoids the rakfisk CROPANI in nose, he is not a bad thing - such as sushi, quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cool and wet fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In the depths of winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and then - no doubt aided by alcohol subdued senses - consumed.
A generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians forced in search of work, to leave their country and immigrated mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, drawn by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, which was not too long ago, much richer than Norway, ieceotaji flows.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strict smelling part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway is not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere.
Here hates it still Anders Breivik, to name names - those racist right-wing extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children.
Instead, referred only to the "incident on July 22."
Norwegians do find it difficult to accept that someone is in their peace-loving country to such brutal killings.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway has been around since the early 1970's growth is one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," Anna, our waitress who Cuocere round trays with seasoned rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal says.
We are a - as they say - prudent people.
Her English is like that of most people here.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not emerge.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very careful - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.
As with all money raised in the years leading up to the world economic crisis, which they had not, Norway gave his wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And, of course, rakfisk Easting," she adds with light-hearted laugh.
I am in the snow and instead on another court - from rakfisk I have enough.
As a moose burgers is definitely something I enjoy. The juicy meat.
But in the evening, the stinky fish on the menu.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several locations that can organize a rakfisk dinner, guests in the best sense of smell - or perhaps the most challenging - Ospreys votes.
There is a live TV circuit with a fly-shirted show master, which is surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What number you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"
Here are our points, "Harvard."
They applauded and laughed.
A man falls overwhelmed by his chair, possibly from the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the tough reality of the whole fish.

Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration will grant analyzed by the BBC, the challenges facing him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel, which was sealed off several important transport routes in the capital and chaos in the streets.
The goal, however, it was not to interfere with commuter on the way to work, but also to prevent demonstrators trying to reach the parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Präsidentenbinde and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon, Mexico can prove economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has claimed in the past six years, as many as 60,000 lives.
"My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office, the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this goal.
Before he went with the US president at eye level, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided over the new head of state.
A direct Nalezy
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo reminds you, for example, to him.
Residents of the resort to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on the highways, Pena Nieto, construction and pose a major improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that were once here.
With his name plaques hanging outside of a modern sports centre and a spectacular interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect from him real and lasting change," his friend and political ally LAX Gabriel Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party, the PRI's Pena Nietos.
In particular, with regard to the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman LAX admits that the party after 12 years of the capture of the Presidential Palace outside of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
Subsequently, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast could not be on the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo.
The town lies hidden under highway bridges and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military has been switched to combat the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a dirt wasteland near a large garbage dump the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been killed in the last two years left.
During the administration of Governor Pena Nieto Mexico were in the state killed about 1,000 women - a statistic that surpasses even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is for the violence and the killings of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is dealing with the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least not appropriate.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the rundown district, is fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as she showed me photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of events in 2010, according to Mariana committed suicide.
But her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that they had been beaten, and the body rigid had already used.
While her mother tells her story, an image of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is right next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, you have until now refused.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a humbug, troublemakers, whingers.
You want to accept their verdict and the mouth.
"But this is not possible, if there were so many flaws and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto, on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde, he also has a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to take care during his tenure, especially around this problem.
"I hope that as president, he is, as he was as governor," the congressman císla LAX in Valle del Bravo says.
But that is exactly what fear the families of the victims in Ciudad neza most.

The prosecutor said: Bradley Manning have complained about mistreatment
The prosecution opposes Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing dealt with Mannings time in the military prison in Virginia, Theodore Roosevelt
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the charges due to harsh prison conditions.
The US Army Corporal is alleged to have stolen thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutor has tried on Friday that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning missed - accused of the largest leak of confidential information of American history - multiple opportunities to complain about the alleged mistreatment suffered by him in military detention.
During a cross-examination Mannings: during a hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland said maj. Ashden fine that documents weekly visits to the prison officials during detention Mannings neunmonatiger Theodore Roosevelt, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request from the defense to reject the indictment - Manning had been punished by the harsh prison time already had enough - Manning testified that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of having stolen while serving in Iraq, thousands of confidential documents.
The material was released by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday was fine by Manning completed the forms, the officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Militärgefängnis Theodore Roosevelt, where he had spent from July 2010 to April 2011, increased prison conditions.
The officials said Manning questions and wrote his answers.
As finely quizzed him on Friday to the forms, Manning admitted that he judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment of a "very professional."
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about mistreatment, although the officials questioned Manning directly on his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and officials have discussed this with him, and to deal with them. They were recorded.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns)" no problems "and that did not necessarily mean that I said anything," Manning said.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning asked why he has not complained about his treatment, in January 2011, met with a committee to investigate the from him a few months earlier on a form mentioned suicidal thoughts.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting have been to downgrade his observation status to "prevention of injury."
The military said that it had him this restrictive status - which is a step below the suicide risk - and the protection of other assigned.
"I wanted to convince people that it was good for me, and the observation status to the prevention of injury Conserva (...) to be able to achieve a higher quality of life, from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months, before he was transferred in July 2010 in the prison of Theodore Roosevelt naval base in Virginia.
In Kuwait, he said, he had considered suicide and was due to the heat even unconscious.
Not to know what was happening with him or in the outside world, was.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, in this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Theodore Roosevelt, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
We have allowed him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said that he had tried to keep moving, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie.
I always have to sleep with a drive from outside his cell.
When he turned up at night, and his face no longer guards have woken up, you could see him, so he shot back up again.
In January 2011 Mannings lawyer formally raised objections to the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning to an accusation that he made in his statement on Thursday, so he must have had a night of naked in his cell and Theodore Roosevelt in a morning counting naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had during this census never had the chance to wrap themselves with its ceiling.
At the hearing on Friday, he said that Manning was closed from a command of his guards that he should leave the ceiling, with which he could cover. He admitted, however, that no one had asked him.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced into the previous night to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show an officer that he poses no danger to themselves.
Manning told the officials that he could use the federal his underwear or his flip-flops, to injure themselves, however, did not.
On this night, Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will take account of his prison experiences at least and reduce its detention standards dramatically, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will commit minor offenses guilty, while others will be contested charges, which are considered too extreme.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. From the prosecutor a justification of the detention conditions is expected.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules that apply to all among the highest security prisoners under Theodore Roosevelt.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful release of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
He is found guilty on all counts, he faces a life sentence.

My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced by the lack of opportunities to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - call them in difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport control, as confusion in me.
Signs point to two queues: one for "mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure to what I should go.
I grew up in central California and was my whole life, "Mexicans."
An ethnic symbol - just as my friends in Boston, "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."
Later, I opted for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or dashes.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to compete in this language on both ends of the interviews.
But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not Conserva.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros.
I thought about those moment this week, as the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues, which are expected to meet the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to remain in Mexico to emigrate rather than in the United States.
He would like to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc modeled after the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against Mexico's drug cartels, although he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States in 1848 a fell in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun, forced to leave them more than half its territory.
But for Mexicans, the thinking in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event will not be overlooked.
Therefore, once a US government official also performs only mildest criticism of Mexico, you can hear it - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children Montezumas go on the war path.
But the greatest challenge in Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not do that.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio life, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parents or grandparents part - got no chance in Mexico and in the direction of North emigrated.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we are living the American dream, perhaps now visited good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred may sometimes, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is clearly in the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class do not like.
This is based on reciprocity.
They look at us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion of our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not now caught behind the silk curtain, with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and, as a child, legally in the United States, was reminded me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans resent them.
While it is an American citizen, she sees itself as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans Campane, have the feeling to belong neither to the one nor to the other country.
The Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte love, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It has the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes it even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated bourgeoisie want to take their connections to the diaspora.
You Mexican Americans want to use as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico to defend their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of incomes, the rampant corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I am afraid, because it by Cackling alone, friends.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans bear a grudge for how their family members were discussed until not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas udovít could prove to be a cornerstone for peace
There can be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events such Movimientos seem to nip in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations were countless buildings to rubble and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them killed civilians, and six Israelis - and the first time rockets are taken from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, changed the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could eventually find their end.
A war that neither lost nor gained will
At first glance, seems optimistic given the current situation than anything else.
Even if the 21 November agreed ceasefire holds, this week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007 will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although his group itself has seen large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and packed the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in a dense desolatesten bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, wins the Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists won in the Arab world, Hamas can learn powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once seen as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has seized on the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren embossing could face the Stürzung Bashar Assad's, to Jordan, where Hamas-allied threaten the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi inhabitants - by far the strongest and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region.
The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations Hamas could prove to be a player who can not be from Israel and the United States wooed.
Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion.
In military terms Hamas is no longer dangerous.
The Israeli anti-missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove themselves, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
For a while, at least, Israel will not be able to sleep peacefully.
In diplomatic terms the United States hold firm on its position, many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who ignored the peace process to a large degree.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed 30 Israelis have since 2004, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the closing plants, which lost in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. This will protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared as illegal under international law, however, will continue to expand.
Netanyahu as well. His Likud party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on January 22, Avigdor Lieberman, with an even kämpferischeren group.
Nanny why these scheming Palestinians and leave them in a state of their own?
If you really are in control of the West Bank, they are not exactly like their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip, including firing missiles?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in chess and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to carry the day. But the Arab Spring could make them.
Even if the Islamists who now in Egypt and in other countries in the seat of power, there is little left for Israel, they will focus initially on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense budget is larger than that of Israel's four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab governments little in the overhaul of its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama, working together to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
The Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians will continue to be stripped of their right to self-determination - a powder keg waiting to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week, a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
Now the oppression undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation is only going to get worse.
Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from foreign
The right answer is represented by the more representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two states, Israel is for security purposes.
The - for the near future small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders granted more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must stop now, along with Turkey and Qatar, the arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
It would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama also must play its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term he missed the presentation of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also reluctant to participate in it.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Australian laws for single cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands.
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia to be replaced by neutral brand logos and colors, dark green lids, which are also printed with graphic images that sick body parts and cigarette smoke ill infants and children.
Apart from the various health warnings and images from next Saturday, is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are identical, printed in small letters.
In Australia, the world's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by the glamorous image of smoking will be eliminated.
This is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not yet started with 26, to smoke, with 99% disabled likely will start after that.
"You can already see in children younger age, try to understand the message to the tobacco companies with their brand image," Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies that showed, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and only slightly on the profits of multinational corporations, the changes will affect other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
So it was with the laws would benefit the black market trade, leading to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
"The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia says.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra hectares of zico, import Pty Ltd., a small family businesses, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone lids have risen to cover the unbearable packaging, since the companies, British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Supreme Court, with its challenge to the Australian laws.
Zico up to 6,000 units have been sold to wholesalers and wait for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
The snag is that, according to experts in the popularity of social media at precisely the population, the plan goes.
A number of Australian law has banned tobacco companies from the TV ads, it forbids them to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to interpret cigarettes in shops. Now the tobacco advertising is changed in the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but it has no influence on international sites.
"Anyone who sells tobacco and only a small section has been to promote its products, is not on the Internet," said Becky Freeman, a researcher at health care at the University of Sydney says.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman noted a rise in doswiadczenie reports about brands, which were submitted by "ordinary people."
The question must be asked: is this just a private person who is so big favour of Marlboro cigarettes, even to the extent that it takes up a video - or has a marketing agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead of focusing on marketing to grapple with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization on unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries has increased trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to 2001 before wrote photographic warnings.
Now they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers defiantly show.
The pictures do not affect me.
I ignore them.
"It takes just a hole and put the box," says Victor Destacó hage when buying a pack of cigarettes, a photo is printed with a mouth tumour.
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the pack" in the city of Sydney, says the uniform packaging have hampered the filling its shelves.
"I need to sort an hour to a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should simply ban cigarettes entirely - then we would have told us, that's okay, we are close," he added, visibly angry.

In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is a good time to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about boredom.
I will not lie.
Wait a half day at the airport on a flight, is quite nervtötend - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to you, it is for us, and our children - is okay, occasionally to be bored.
So that the brain is forced into interesting thoughts to lose, which promotes the creativity.
And because most of us today, almost always on the screen, giving us the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
This brings me back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which develops with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "boredom: a Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it that way.
"Indeed, the boredom, a very long history," he says.
The house walls pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti on boredom, which goes back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is defined in many ways and discussed.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that to boredom, as the experience, "a satisfying work, but it will not be able to define themselves."
Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person is not concerned, but this is going to be.
The apathy, on the other hand, there is no rush to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disruption of attention process, coupled with a bad temper and a sense that time passes slowly."
Boredom can listen to almost as such as depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be seen in the context of bored people the problem in the environment or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that is boring, even if we just have to concentrate on.
In their study, "The unengaged Mind: defining boredom in terms of attention" to "the idle minds: the definition of boredom, from the point of view of the attention," which was published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television program from the neighboring area, this has nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group heard this noise at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for them and signed their difficulties of boredom.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom, Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study said.
However, if you put a monotonous activities, "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help to do not feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom can fight, even by people remain physically more closely.
"Studies have shown that children who must herumhampeln learn more and more information for those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all will eventually dull - my pretenii dröhnender flight, according to the spokesman, a particularly ermüdender film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980s to a "vulnerability" scale of boredom.
On the scale are statements such as "many things that I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But, in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter clusters.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development conducted at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents were bored in school and do the homework, while 23 percent said they would be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents gave in to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
He was sure, however, that "the youth perceived as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers should not have a big impact on their daily lives.
So back to my original question: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people take extreme physical risks and the gambling or drug addicted to relieve you - the studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Vodanovich, professor of the issue for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain will tell you that you should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of as New York.
But the brain do not know what you do best.
If one is boring and you this energy used to cook and play guitar, we will be happy.
But television can ensure happiness for the short-term, but in the long term this evaporate.
A bored child who is an iPad, enough so that it can distract from the boredom. It has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, Professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to talk, but also in other areas more self-control.
I do not believe that we should be celebrating boredom.
We should also see them not to be critical.
Instead, our aim should be to us too far away from the constant activity and Technologieberieselung.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth just look for a way to unwind and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly stimulated, it is difficult to deal with, even if the noise is silent."

In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime to justice in this country will soon be legal: the possession of a few chunks of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends on a September day with the car in Lamar, near the border with Kansas on the road when they were halted.
After the police found marijuana in the car, was summoned Orozco for possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien - excusable peccadilloes, which are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and received a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But it is also a?
Maybe in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drug offenses, less by the law than from the site.
Hundreds of regulations that are related to marijuana, and dropped in the state of Washington, which has already approved similar measures.
The police authorities are adults over 21 years for possession of a small crowd. This is legally permitted, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced plans to follow the existing marijuana offenses, and people are still quoting court.
At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains in order to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. oates, the police chief in Aurora, which lies east of Denver says.
And regulators in the state of Washington to contemplate scratching their heads.
They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until December 1, 2013.
In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado in any case is ahead of most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for private consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, the state is therefore good for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Authority says for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith admits that no place or system can do more to serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502 enters into force on December 6, and thus represents the end point of a grey area, in which the state licensing system exists yet, but legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practice issues must be resolved in this time around, as the government target of a "reasonable access" to which resulted in inserting beeps into marijuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"It will be harder nirgendwo, a site for a licensed cannabis business to find than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group says.
On November 21, Chief oates sent his employees in Aurora, an e-mail, he said, the prosecutor would pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21 years longer, and that the police "immediately" will seek no prosecutions for these crimes.
Chief oates added that the police will continue to implement städtische targets for the regulation of medical marijuana growers and drug traffickers would continue.
In Weld County in northern Colorado district prosecutor Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he has said that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana brought before the court, although many were prosecuted for other crimes.
"Our agency has the duty to pursue violations, which were at the time for crimes," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the country, shows adults for the possession of small quantities of any longer.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided, however, not all outstanding Possess procedures.
"I do not believe that I'm wasting my time in order to enforce the law until it is changing," he says.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was already clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state fostered a deep split among local officials in relation to the big, green experiment.
District prosecutors ajaru when there is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents for marijuana offences in court, the defendants and acts as a spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws.
"They have spent a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for criminal prosecution, that you can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states, such as alcohol, the small quantities of marijuana to treat, Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for the sale of legal age, you can also wait nervously on instructions from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level and continue to treat as a criminal offence.
Advocates of legalization movement in the hope that the Justice Department is going to give.
Despite several spectacular carcinogenic arrests of the consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government allows the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states, for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik advisor to the Obama administration believes that investigators will probably no doors to seize smaller quantities of drugs, however, are likely to suffer under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado are not only that the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratorium on new marijuana shops, although this could open only in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban is likely to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in a position where we license someone and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We have done, for what the community and not according to what the government has decided.
Still, many questions remain open.

Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford, because I am Tory
Not only for university students from being attacked for their views.
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once for the stamp of the world's largest, for a modern Greek symposium, which encouraged the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after I entered the Worscester College in the late 1980s - there I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought back as the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said it, I would have gone, because I had a problem that students in neighbouring rooms had sex.
The author of A N Wilson said schelmisch, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
They had harassed me for one reason only - one reason seemed in this alleged cradle of enlightenment so parochial and cruel: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and I advocate in the Conservative Party.
Why am I saying this now?
According to recent reports, now suffers from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecutions.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford has gained such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection, who is gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College, you will be on the basis of their political views, "actively often isolated, attacked personally and declared undesirable."
They want to ensure a place in the equality committee of college, so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent broadcasting documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It shows an alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association at the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce was, among other things, and with silver suit and silver occupied protzte walking stick.
At other universities conservative students say that they are seen as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association at the University of Nottingham said in a Sunday newspaper: "there is a growing trend left at universities.
People believe that we are like the Bullingdon club, without ever got to have. "
, Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford says, they have watched at JRC members a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and the welfare of the members," she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was in a minority.
As incredibly shy 18-year-olds I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education no honorary title.
The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.
In the first days of the week, in the current new students get to know each other and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors tolerated the mockery of Tory students not only, but even with friends attended it.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the premises of holzgetäfelten Tutoriums.
In my first of these events I should translate French texts from the 18th century English. On what it should have been, I was not taken.
"," Miss Wyatt said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), please, "the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face as pie dough, and quite invidious.
"Refuse Thatcher followers to learn French, or they are just stupid?," he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Tears in my eyes on wallten.
"I suggest that you do in your spare time, a few French hours - in other words, if you're not preoccupied with their social activities are," Pitt to gave me.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
This evening, I sat in the College alone at the dinner, as I typed on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory harassed.
For me it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first semester, pretending to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I later tried to distract me.
I insisted that I may not always agree with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics and economics, the irony is that as a conservative force had attended Eton College, said to me: 'you're the daughter of a fascist pig. "
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"As the Tories have sex?" One asked me.
The blow each other, or?
I felt so, such as homosexuals from the more liberal legislation in the United States had to have felt like.
I would ever be able to lead at the University of Oxford a normal life?
I would meet with like-minded people can only after nightfall?
I should turn to the Labour Party and the need to express my natural inclinations?
The three years that were extended in front of me before my eyes to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who was open to identify themselves as Tory, Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, based in my college.
Not only was he hated to be a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy speeches and write for you.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, it was narrow and parochial and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic-fascist history perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties, has been accepted by all political views.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
You would never do something like this, not in my city of träumenden spires.
Even my Communist friends always showed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes marred.
Give the world a chance.
I'm sure you just neckt.
It would break my heart if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and Renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, when another Geschichtstutor claims seriously, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I admitted that my parents to undergo "brainwashing" and called them "old idiot."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who suggested the last nail in the coffin of my Âs career.
At the time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes my Häscher gave up.
As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weinerlichen repeated.
But no 18-year-olds should ever have to suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and spite.
And even more tragic is that it was an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory, but until now behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino has elegance of celebrity."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of couture," which opened this week in London, talking with ABC naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Modemachers.
, Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England is the only place in the British capital, which is hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani worthy.
This has the designer at the opening of "Valentino - master of couture," acknowledged, a grandiose retrospective, for the more than 130 haute couture dresses were developed, which were created by his "house" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is to write a story whose sole protagonist "Il Signore" Garavani but is not without its distinguierte clientele.
Valentino had always been fascination for the sticky and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the choicest aristocracy, starting from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows this personal memories as trophies of his social ascent of the modest voghera fashion in the city in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
To be in love with the noble, must not be at a disadvantage.
"At least join their derail not on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from the pop music do," Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza says.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant host.
"We were all of us, when we were invited in his house in Gstaad," from "Dawson had Heini" Thyssen, one with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or come Niarchos explains.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress from Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza forgets the charisma of Modemachers.
Many years ago, we went to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the recognized degerli, food and music and you felt his influence.
"All invited felt important and loved," the "Top Model," which began her career at the haute couture week in Paris in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion, because its design works of art," she finally says.
Fashion show of origin.
The lives of Garavani is no history of Versessenheit more mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House, has been turned into a glorious and 60 meters long catwalk, suggesting a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model and the catwalk along to admire a beautiful "audience," the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes, the Monica vitti -Fantaisie "La Notte," or a coat made of wool and leather, which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls names such as the Sibilla de armónico rays, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashion, 2006
Many of those customers say the first Valentino is like your first love, "unforgettable."
I can remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," said naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer says.
"I prefer it to all the other because of his great love for women and because it highlights our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria adds.
I like the colors he used very; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion-leading the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d Arenberg, this is the first time we can not forget when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed the age and the opportunity to have to wear one of his dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, there was then.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a celebration at the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and a draped bodice with a neckline that makes his presence.
"It was a dream come true," the widow of Rodrigo d Arenberg says.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," the Italian Aristokratin who lived between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d Arenberg retained their evening dresses of Modemachers "with the utmost care" on, "not only because a dress is a dress, but also the associated memories."
The "king" of fashion.
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary in order to make this Ivory silk dress with pearls, 12 different embroidery and a half metres long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy signature style even when grunge, deconstruction of the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the Supreme society."
For years, with the "tarnished" the elite savoir-être, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy), the highest award Cavaliere del Lavoro, he was appointed Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour added Garavani so many honors, as each of the husbands of its customers.
"What has struck me is always be refinement, his calm, his appearance and perfect Ottima," Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him a month ago, at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time it leaves no trace of him."
And it says a princess...

The hardest job in the world: the human work animals from Kawah Ijen
Four euros for the makers of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if you contribute 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is hell, and other work literally in hell.
This is the case with anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers, who earn their living by collect sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has risen .therefore every day on the floor of the crater, where the tube sulfuric gas out of the ground is in contact with the air.
After he extracted large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transported them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the stone paths.
There are only 250 metres up to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the weary makers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, and you have to keep the balance and put their steps carefully so that they do not slip and fall.
You know that each step can cost your life, as a French tourist happened years ago which crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers from Kawah Ijen 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which they deserve.
On top of the hill, the path between the tourists who shoot as circus monkeys and run at the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company set up a little Hereunder at an altitude of 1850 metres has
The company PT candi Ngrimbi exploiting since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and (better) never said his workers, which they 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
The sold them for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life, and used in the manufacture of wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"As we normally 70 kg, we received for each way around 46,000 rupees (3.8 million)," anto, the power in the normal case three routes on the day explained to us.
For each course he needed three hours that it creates, at the end of the day, but then he has 138,000 breast cancers detected rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost superhuman effort, but it is the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees ($1.2 million) in the coffee harvest paid on the day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," said the sources, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 million) a day, and the work was not so hard, but anto is with his family in Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I've brought you to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, and his eyes are often was coughing irritation due to toxic gases.
The 27-year-old anto since three years of his life to the Kawah Ijen on the battlefield, whose sulphur when it left the tracks, although he covers his face with a mask and Spezialbrille.

Singapore needs babies to rescue the economy.
The SWF's, Singapore's shifting the blame to ensure that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons yet, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as "will," Bao "(loaf in the oven), about the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun of.
The advertising agency BBH, which has video preserves the hope that the advert achieved in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of music, wanted to bring the people to perform their "national duty."
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The Fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to take care of us.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of speed-dating evenings flirting (fast).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?
1.2 children
This is not an easy issue, the Government of Singapore.
Every year there are 1,300 US dollars for political measures to encourage people to have more children.
A package of government for married couples and parents grants of up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in south-east Asia, is also on the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the SWF's, Singapore's more children?
, Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of the national population authority says that this was due to a "better training" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to marry and to form a family to have a lot more options in terms of lives and to set priorities," she said.
These changes in the social realities have to the higher number of people living alone and the delay in the marriage and birth control, which resulted in the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, led an immigration policy that aims to counter a surge in immigration, to reduce the population to resentment in the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the little laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese, which have been criticised for keeping wages low and integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher fees and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the well-known effects on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the health-care costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also showed unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that many small apartments are being built.
So does have an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, the concern is that they can support the lifestyle of the people living alone, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large housing for families.
However, Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company Destacó Developers says that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger units.
This means that they are for our cash flow much better.
He admits, however, that the new standards would give developers clearer guidelines, which had previously been placed obstacles in the way, if you build too many small units in a project.
Too much stress.
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if the new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate, is in talks with the Singapurern who work in the financial district, that it will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed that housing and education are expensive, so it will be delayed by many," a young manager says.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," another, about 20-year-old man says.
Men and women have their career, the stress and the cost of the property and education as the reasons for this is that you cannot have children.
That is why the SWF's, Singapore's the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much.

The offline private offline is online Privatni
Privacy
According to the dictionary, the property Privatni or "areas of private life, where you are entitled to protection against any kind of interference."
What is required for anyone under 16 years?
As this definition is applied to his daily life and the social networks?
He understands the risks to which he is, if he makes the Internet situations, he would not take part in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 years, which are often on the Net.
In four of the cases they tied the term with "something very private" on a personal level, and "on the password and user," if you apply it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets, I would not be known in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in Web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has spent two years on accounts.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may not know it, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On FB I upload pictures or images of games.
I also distributes me my time with friends.
"I would be part of a photo that is not of me, or someone who makes the stupid," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to write obscene photos of naked PUBLISH, crime, or abusive or violent comments.
Jorge reassured to know about 35 friends he in FB and nine folger on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Including the mother, the password to one of the accounts.
I reported to me on Twitter to express myself and to write interesting tweets.
"I don't know whether someone will respond, I invite you only high," he added.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak with relatives in the distance or with friends," he said.
Asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone is a strange empfähle, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. He admits, 20 of the people not to know that he has added to his friend list.
"I am not scared, because we have something in common, such as music," he claimed.
According to the young has made him one innuendo or asked him after his address or phone number.
"If somebody harassed me or she asks me to do, I remove it from my account," he admits.
Jose got in contact with ASK, after he read a recommendation on Twitter.
The young are not unknown experience, we know today as cyber-bullying.
The well-known a freundin was blackmailed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José has the victims closed the account.
"He has made it only privately."
He then outlined a series of steps to set up a user account.
In contrast to Jorge this boy would upload photos of famous in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, this is what I would do if it is me or unsympathetic one I want to wipe him out.
"But I know that this is a cyber-bullying," he said.
Key issues
Marielos porras, English teacher, with a master's degree in education and learning believes that are understood to adjust the children and young people, that is the purpose of the social networks.
"The Internet as a medium for the search for information; with the release of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explained that the academics, Marc Prensky, title holder of a master's degree in education at Yale University and author of "digital natives and immigrants" shaped these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, children and young people, who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants, who they are, where we are still learning," he says.
He said that it is a complex issue, "because we are asking of you that you have a defined criteria, what may be published or distributed, said, in an age where the Ripeness is not sufficient."
"They should also be fussy, if you think it is the most important thing is to be loved to have thousands of friends, without the consequences," he added.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and adolescents, which is privacy, to ask you questions, which will lead you to think.
"You to say you should not do it, does not work," he says.
Then called porras some possibilities: there are things that you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or: would you, if we published a photo of you, as you published by a friend?
You know what the other PUBLISH about you?
You have the other people asked for permission in advance, if you carry photos of celebrations?
And one more question: should all know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside of the Internet, with respect, decency and other principles, and the same should apply for the social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that parents read the directives of social networks.
If you understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of Eröffnens one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what one part or PUBLISH must" he said.
According to the Guardia children need to be reminded of the lesson, "Thou shalt not talk to strangers."

"South America must learn on the integration of the citizens," Rafael Correa says
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th summit meeting of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, Peru, said on state television that the Europeans' in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing "and" almost a fatherland. "
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, pushing the member countries of the Unasur.
"Must be achieved, the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as has been the case in the Andean Community; but there are still reactionary sectors that are seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of the Republic of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take account of those who signed the San José Agreement on human rights.
That, the lessons never commit to something, and in return we sign the South Americans. "
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington and financed by the United States," he said as a reference to the political asylum in Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said that he did not regret this decision, because it betrayed its principles, but have not complied with its "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that it was "justified suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and not be respected."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which requires him to give him an interrogation on its territory for an alleged sexual offence, while the Swedish law allows it via a video conference, the Embassy of Ecuador in London could be executed. "
Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since it is located in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador told me that he had a slight problem with the statements, but no serious," the head of state of Ecuador said.
There is a danger, though, that he took physical and psychological damage, because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises outdoors can perform.
"That would be detrimental to the health of all people," he added.
Correa that the solution to the asylum, which was granted Assange since June, the Embassy of Ecuador in London, the granting of an open letter, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that it would be in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe 's. He stressed that there have been talks with London, in order to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, that we apply in this case, it did not, however, give full talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange Baltazar Garzón, leading to a series of procedures at various European bodies," he said.
And "if Britain granted this morning, in my opinion, this is done."
And if Sweden and interrogated Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype, as does the Swedish law, and in other cases, is the problem.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the malicious intent and the lie that refute the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press is not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists, the pursuit of profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador not more of these journalists, "and dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and skewers bourgeois countries," and that he was in a re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism must "stay firm and will not give any opportunism and clad coup must be legal," because the legitimacy of democracy was "destroyed in Paraguay."
The President of the Republic of Ecuador is also keeping the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the bevorteilte maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua's maritime legal boundaries between the two countries to negotiate, for "absolutely right."
At present this judgment is not implemented.
It is a problem between the South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated, so that it can be overcome and look forward.
He also relied on a successful conclusion of the disputes over the maritime boundary between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, to achieve his third term in order, he stated that he sees this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he would lose the election in February 2013, out of political life, he would withdraw.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances, such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was there, guaranteed the probable victory, so I'll have this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as President, then me withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is crucial," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken with the vice-president, Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, "he told me that he traveled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could travel to the election campaign back to Cuba.
"It does not necessarily mean a return to the health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader took part in Lima today at the sixth summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration, in order to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security.

The cause of a dying of AIDS today is a belated recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old, confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says of the moment that he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to care only about his illness and started to inform themselves; and this with such dedication that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which is difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, a few treatment options and more stigmata.
Then it became the director of a clinic of imss to adopt, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
Now, however, many people are still in the hospital, unaware of their disease and where the virus has already caused damage and your immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, after the first reported cases, "the big success today means that the survival of patients to take the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," the head of the HIV unit of the hCG, jaime Andrade Villanueva said, although he said that this information was based in April this year from a reputable scientific publication.
, an expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists inferred since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depends on the extent of the damage to the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that those who do not have a greater chance that drugs are: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a census of 500 CD4.
Simply put, mean that anyone above the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in this sense, "easily 75 years old can, as long as it is under control," he said.
In order to view this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today amounts to an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 reduced in 2011 (annual report of onusida)), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the national database collected since the release of the patients have died of AIDS.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the month of May this year are already in 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there are since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
So, why people are still dying?
I think the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no problems with the supply of medicines. The problem is that people come in far advanced state, because they know their infection status, which is not in the late stages of the disease.
He makes a compelling statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have a lifelong infection to be able to deal with the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are SUBCONTRACTOR influence, which is why all those people where it is needed, massive screening tests must be offered."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de ciudades más caras del sida en Jalisco (Coesida) to vote (the State Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio, who has carried out its test at a private laboratory, and this for the simple reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS phase and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and want to hear nothing.
"If I have to die, then three times better place," they say in my case.
The change was to improve Appui ernähre me well, I do, and I take the medication.
Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I am working, I have a lot of responsibility, but an active sex life, I'm on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio lists, which agreed to share his intimate details with Milenio Jalisco to encourage those who, with his testimony today in the context of the world AIDS day fear.
They should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group. The sooner you know whether you are HIV-positive, the better, and if you know the diagnosis, they have to learn how to live as all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizens large holes, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara that the cause of HIV has adopted.
And the most important thing is prevention.
On this particular places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased Wénjn; they were made separately, now you are giving us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The risk of new infections among young people.
"What you need the widespread derision?" Is a question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people want to get out, the correspondent said.
He proposed to orient these inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of institutions that are frequented by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
It should not be the beer and motel paid, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms should be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity exercise," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There's 13.435 cumulative cases (1.317 12.158 AIDS and HIV).
The state is in fourth place nationally and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection cases of sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2% Perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there is a case for 4 or 5 people that do not know.

You could say that the procedures to ensure the survival of the company, to allow Mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes in contradiction to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, on June 15, recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge at the court in Hale Harlin Bancarrotas leads for the northern district in Texas that Mexican companies the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo are helpless.
But the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico the floodgates to call for tripartite inconsistencies and the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge in the case indicates that the creditors must be subject to the laws of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings in Mexico's trade bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in the areas of corporate insolvency procedures with länderübergreifendem profile is not known.
Indeed, it was for this purpose that the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, while the American Law Institute, was used as a peacemaker.
Secondly, the ruling states that do not have the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debt would be without the vote of the companies after the recognition of liabilities in the liquidation of the branches in vitro with its parent company, had been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
Indeed, IVF is not the first case in which this scheme has been allowed.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed among companies in the group of the Instituto Federal de concursos mercantiles (Federal Institute for trade bankruptcies).
It is true that after deducting the voices of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who filed a lawsuit in the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had no majority.
The vote could have gone 45 percent against 37 percent.
This will be taken into consideration by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, there are vitro to blame for its difficult situation in 2008, in the framework of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country.
For this reason, the Gonzalez Sada family before the same court of appeal out, so that the vote will take place in the plenary session of all the judges, i.e., because only three of them voted.
Will be granted, will not appeal the Cerciorare appealed, calling for a review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious in this case is that the court set aside a document, which was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), where the in vitro procedure is described in the framework of the law on trade bankruptcies, and pointed out that it will adhere strictly to the agreements signed by the two countries had to respond to the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law in the United States.
It will also pointed out that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, the guarantee of equality between debtors and creditors.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life."
The globetrotter, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was the basket sport longer than 60 years and has traveled around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the city of the country as "Hetin ctor Reyes."
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, Rexes was 6 years of this sport, be it as a player lower classes, the first National League player representative, and head of the BSN with the vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My life I have put me in the basketball many hats, even several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora near his home in Bayamón Isabel, where he lived with his faithful wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify.
In the heart of Bayamón
The most emotional recollections are those who remember his time at the vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player in 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or managers of the clubs.
"That was my best years that I most enjoyed, because I had the opportunity to be part of the vaqueros eight championships since 1967 it as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including five championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
Then came "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "Reyes said.
I know that genes Bartow, who worked as a trainer and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), I was hired, said: "I have a very strong and 2-foot-tall players.
You want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow law.The recommended the free throw specialists Raymond Gausse, who is a citizen and one of our best shooter was.
I know how he said that if Mincy allows a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another would provide.
The championship of the vaqueros with Gausse was granted, but from a distance, because he was already in 1988 at the top of the Union.
At the time, he prefers to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the upcoming tournament in Mexico against the United States.
After the World Cup in 1990, when we occupied the fourth place, what should have been a bronze, if not this Canadian referee would have been the repeated the last game for the second time, said Pienaca Reyes.
This group of the World Cup in 1990 was the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best in the world, as well as those who won the Olympic Games 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite, however, is the team of the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won the team gold and the US offered a fight, as when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that perhaps in terms of personality was not the best, but we won a gold medal and gave us great joy, was that of the upcoming tournament in 1995), Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata against all predictions, we won the gold medal.
Who was the best player from Puerto Rico?
This was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking account of his career in different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, the work of Leo Arill suits me well.
What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN included at the beginning of the 1990s until 17 teams in one season.
What remains to be done to you?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes.
The guys in Ponce, for example, play only in their area, and only in the Polo Grounds on national teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children of many unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, referees and officials contracts.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, see my time in music videos from YouTube, Otherwhise my grandchildren and from time to time I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always on my side.

Larry hagman is dead
Larry hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became world famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.." In the television series "Dallas," where he played an unscrupulous, shrewd and manipulative businessman.

He made all the joy, who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original and lived life to the full," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman cirrhosis was diagnosed in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was discovered on his liver and he underwent a transplant.

His movie work of the criticism well rated roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly loathsome J.R. that hagman made to a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television network CBS about the Ewing clan and other figures in their environment was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?" On the expectation should provide for an episode of emotion, where the figure was killed by Hagmann almost led to an international speculation and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
So the series reached a record in that time.
When the answer was in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, the "Dallas" in the second most welcome entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, the 50 million spectators, transformed.
It was the husband of the sister-in-law, Kristin (Mary Crosby) interpreted the shot.
J.R. had made them and threatened to present them as prostitutes when they left the city, but also had other reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted to allow the role of Ewing as a corrupt, Carpetbaggers man with a charismatic smile: a perfidious businessman and untreuer sought a husband, then its alcohol sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to put on the tombstone of J.R.," hagman 1988 said.
It should be called 'the honorable citizens rests J.R. Ewing. "
This is the only business that he has not won.

From Warner or TNT, there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann would be dealt with in the series.

Martin was still a young people, as they got Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben hagman.

The start of the course, the study of the "end of the world."
Every week, the students apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, if the religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the day "long" in the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed that it was the end of the world.
But charmé had no idea what should happen to him in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some described as "Deudarmaggedon ', as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester that ever existed," said charmé this week the students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey.
If someone analyzed what happened today in the world, as if we were away for 30 days, this would be a really good period.
And he pointed out that the bad good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor, offers this semester that should be the last in the history, should the "end of the world."
In Temple of beisitzende Professor Barry vacker gives the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, the students apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear materials into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic terms content and studied how they compare themselves in comparison with the real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, credible and is impossible," says vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history and his colleague Matthew rest Principalmente Amara beisitzende Solari, a professor of art history and anthropology formed a team to offer a course with the simple title "the end of the world."
"We are not in 2012, so that we will always have the option to take the course, in the event that the world is not all the rest," he said.
Despite the "impending doom" to the students, create projects and participate in exams.
Penn State in the final examination will be carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other than "until the night continue to work, where the world is going to end," rest all said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more" rest all of its course for students with high average, filled with 35 students said.
For weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mails from students who asked whether courts are free.
The students, for their part, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fantastic to see what people do to themselves," Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from diminished said, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects or religion mentality is really just a question of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student wants Wekesa psychology and health care, said to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a classroom, where it is taught," he admitted.
I enjoy it.
But none of those surveyed students - and even less a professor, said to believe the last date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayans, and in a particular way we discredit it," Julie Zeglen, a student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester said.
The Mayans never predicted that the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said all the rest.
He notes, however, that an apocalyptic fear is in the western society which dates back several centuries, when the people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"So people don't think elsewhere," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at the University of La Salle, teaching this year in the Philippines quickly responding to the question of whether he would know where a course on the "end of the world."
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as a hint on an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Rest all pointed out that many days over the years has spoken of the last court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people immediately think about a new date" or Miniums philosophierten that the December 21, the start of a seven-year term, which would be the end of the world.
Students and professors take this data easily.
Several said that they would like to go on "to celebrate the end of the world."
"Maybe I call on a few friends, so that together we can laugh," Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications, said.
