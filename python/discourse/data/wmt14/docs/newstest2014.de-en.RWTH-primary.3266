In a speech in the summer education minister Michael Gove said that "there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," he stressed, GCSEs would be "challenging, ambitious and rigorous."
Studies show that less time is spent in English schools for mathematics - 116 hours per year, or three hours per week per year - than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore get 138 hours.
While there will be no formal request for more time in the curriculum for mathematics, but coalition sources said that the comprehensive Mathe review - combined with a greater weighting of the compartment in rankings - will probably encourage schools to call more hours.
The curriculum will focus on "real life" of the problems, including financial mathematics.

Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden is always ready to talk with German authorities.
But first he wants to clarify his situation.
It was not clear what the United States wanted former NSA employees in a letter addressed to the rotating Hans-Christian Stroebele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and published by the federal government, has forwarded the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
The letter, according to a translation by Stroebele used the following wording:
To the people in charge
I was asked to write to you about your investigation to mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was used by contract or a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions witnessed systematic violations of my government that led me from a moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw I was exposed to a serious and persistent agitation that forced me to leave my family and my country.
I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have the revelations to a system of mass surveillance that is accountable to nobody, as does a public service.
These spy revelations, many proposals for new laws and directives, justified by the formerly concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from the knowledge gained is becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, reduces the risks taken on board.
Although evidence was the result of my efforts, my government treated dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalise political expression and to put on trial.
Still, there is no crime to speak the truth.
I am confident that will give the government of the United States with the support of the international community this prejudicial attitude.
I hope that, if resolved the difficulties of this humanitarian situation, will be able to good clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, especially in terms of truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and gesetzesgemaeß.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country, as soon as the situation is clarified, and I thank you for their efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Stroebele

Traveling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5,000 people
You are here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013."
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 in order to turn it into the "CNN Hero of the Year" to choose.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue its work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched on as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was founded in 1981 in a car accident near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, injured.
First, he had a broken arm, but it was an inflammation of the brain, and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.
"It is not easy," Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at five o "clock in the morning and go to the hospital to be the first, and is not the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if it were a doctor, could afford most Cameroonians to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of health spending in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and to see so many of his countrymen suffer ripened in Bwelle decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 operations last year.
He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, who travels on weekends in rural areas, and it offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the helpless medical equipment on the roof of unprerpared terrain in the villages who need help.
Not everything runs smoothly.
More than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages is free medical care is a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - is the joyous celebration.
The next morning, the team begins with the examination of hundreds of patients.
"We are treating 500 people per trip," Bwelle said.
You come from a 60 mile radius of the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provide medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are due to malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other crutches donated glasses or receive free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team simply operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations are normally held in a school, town house or an apartment, after the procedure, patients on and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the surgery and the Desinfektions equipment is powered by the generator of the group and Bwelle and its volunteers are working until the early hours on Sunday.
It is a very exhausting work, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum throughout the night, so that we remain awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students know last year - has carried out 700 operations and that they had to work a huge difference for the people it helps.
One man said that the free operation RAEC Mons, which he had received, he is allowed to return to work.
"That changed the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital works Bwelle at night in private clinics in Yaounde.
With this second job finance 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he is asleep," says Katie O "Malley, who for the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily participates in Bwelles group.
It is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O "Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience they would never get at home.
"We can be in operations, where we help, blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O "Malley.
That would be in America as a medical student in the second year will never be possible.
The students typically pay for their trip to Cameroon and bring often donated medical equipment.
However, they are in Yaounde, Bwelle accommodation, transportation and guide.
"He is without doubt a hero," says O "Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and its desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no borders.
For Bwelle is the almost constant work, not a burden.
Others to give to a happier life and a promise that he made his father, he is a great pleasure.
"I am so happy when I make this work," Bwelle said.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to get people to laugh and to alleviate the pain.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will for the first time on February 22, appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the senior clerics in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are the ones who choose a Pope Francis, in order to nominate the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80, no longer participate in the pope's election, a group of 120 "cardinals" to voters.
In a statement in which the news was known, said Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, it will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, who is also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to give its decision in February to convene the projects run by known in advance, so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world, can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero, from Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will be dropped until February.
He explained that a pope usually take as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of voting cardinals in 120, and so many cardinals over the age of 80, as he wants.
The consistory next year is so important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero.
Currently, there is some overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty% of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council, founded by Francis to cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Francis has selected these eight cardinals who will help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was "quite possible" that would ask Francis to cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically refer to great places to Cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises - so we do not know whom he appoints."

Europe's elite is willing to do business with the United Kingdom?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for wealth and work in Britain, want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders in the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focuses on countries that modernize and grow, while the states are stagnant in the EU.
Do you wish the government new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil are promoted, instead of the long and exhausting process of reforming the arcane EU institutions.
Asked about their views on specific legal issues - from the antitrust law to the product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, because according to the company's benefits outweigh the costs of Brussels regulations has to be part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies, which are traditionally the most Europhile.
Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a significant majority of Great Britain a course towards the revision of the agreement, and a relationship with the EU, which is based on commerce, not politics.
This realization that is used in businesses of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is in a "meaningful change" that brings back to the United Kingdom.
It is about much - a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would be at 16 percent, a change of view in favor of the agreement of the EU in a referendum.
The prime minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy stands behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK's conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect from a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving toward closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey, which means for companies to pay more attention to trade and a fundamental change in the approach to rules in Brussels.

Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in an appalling situation, and we might ask: What does the parliament from tomorrow, to abolish the judicial independence?," was to read in the newspaper, which does not consider the draft law for the constitution.
"The law is draconian and very true, and we refuse," said Cyrus Kamau, executive director of the Capital Group, including Capital FM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extension of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we urge him to reject this bill and send to the Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star will take the government by the new law "effectively in a stranglehold on the media." By contrast, The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "suffered" a severe blow, and described the proposal as "draconian."
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures designed to enhance national security following the attacks by armed militants on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media incurred the wrath of the authorities, because they published photographs of security cameras, which showed how robbing units dispatched to the scene, the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kima Iyo responded with the Einbestellung two journalists and a leading media Vertreters for interrogation, even if the summons was withdrawn after an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media companies can be punished with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to a million, and the risk of losing their professional recognition or excluded from the official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the people concerned, if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation "can have a single penalty most radio stations in bankruptcy."
Moreover, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on their description of "lively blogosphere" to Kenya.
If it would silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist in the nation, which defines the Kenyan media as a decisive factor of control in public life.
"Politicians are left to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and back to the time of hunters and gatherers," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already moved in the past, the public anger.
In May, they agreed to make the cuts ordered by the national Verguetungs Commission and put their hearty tax-free salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month reinstated - they are among the world's highest.

They are not 100 meters apart. On Tuesday has been supported in the new B747- 33 pedestrian traffic lights in the village parking lot in operation - within sight of the old town hall.
Two installations so close to each other: Faith or folly?
Mayor Gutachs has answered this question yesterday.

The Kluser - traffic lights, both cyclists and bus passenger and the Bergle - residents.
The Plattling plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the Kreuzungs area Sulzbach path / Kirch.

It is the construction of another traffic light: "Safety is simply more than necessary," said Arnold.
A total of four road shows had been carried out, including a roundabout was considered, but because of the narrowness of the Kreuzungs area Sulzbach road / street is rejected.
It was tested according to Arnold at the siting of the light masts before everything: "An extra for us with extra-long trunks loaded trucks we have ausgestestet whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbach path onto B 33, without umzuknicken the traffic light poles."
The approximately 15,000 traffic light itself is the "most modern, and there is currently on the market," Arnold explained.
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so vigorously that the lights are from the drivers, for example, in tiefstehender sun.
They are: The older plants consume about 100 watts of light and economical, the new eight Watt.
Per direction, there are three light installations.
Arnold said the technique of the new plant, which is equipped with two radar sensors.
The problem of the traffic button, tests the upper radar sensor, the traffic situation.
The route is clear, it is immediately green for pedestrians, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
A check of radar sensor that can be terminated by the green phase for pedestrians.
"If a group or disabled people on the road, extending the green phase, everyone has a safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, should the driver use here as partners and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday. As soon as the traffic lights for pedestrian green, watery sleet - a vehicle class with bright red.

Drug tunnels discovered with its own railway between the U.S. and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnel for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operations, was now being discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeter wide touch tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages that they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the Zickzack pattern over a length of six football fields, linking warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area, there are countless unassuming warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before the drugs could be transported to the authorities.
With the discovery of the tunnel had been eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the records of the court.
THREE men who worked as a driver, according to the authorities, were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
If found guilty, he will face prison sentences of between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, put smugglers on a sprawling underground network of Entwaessungskanaelen.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage, which was discovered in 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which represents the drug cartels with the challenge of how to bring their product to consumers.

Foreign workers on 457 visas could be "Echtheits Test"
The government is considering additional measures in the framework of a "Echtheits test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
The test should be introduced, it would amount to a criterion that is used to prevent the 457 occupation by unskilled jobs or as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia.
Today, the government published a proposal for discussion after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, who denounced the government's comments on foreign workers, because they could be viewed by the neighbours of Australia as an insult.
"Vocal declarations like, foreigners should stand back" and "first of all, Australians are a very unpalatable fallback in times when unions demanded a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was reported that white workers should be protected - and if some people in the region vernaehmen an echo of this historic artifact, it would not surprise me.
The proposal outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brendan O "Connor, who was yesterday to talk about people smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "Echtheits criterion" is accepted, it could be someone who applied for a visa to be reviewed to see whether the motion "is really in the cases where the applicant is associated with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring company, or in person."
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, as in the past, companies that wanted to support only a small number of workers, as hundreds have stopped.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum, presumably of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
Nine-year-old unhinged megalomaniacs, the son of the man who came with him to Australia, is maintained since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man into the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.

Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a child, Halloween was something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, late allowed and dress for the neighborhood.
Today, I have become more like a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not declared ready to distribute candy from my apartment, and it will not do so this year.
But according to the statistics, I am a black sheep for Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be precise - celebrate Halloween this year, a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (simultaneously).
Another thing that I am pleased every Halloween, but again, the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the simultaneously.
This year, provocative inanimate objects of rage.
Women must no longer remain in sexy clothes, they can now also tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that Daft Punk - space men will manage this year into the Insta Gram feeds.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year, we have covered our dogs and were not alone in my amazement.
Indeed, Americans give $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, which simultaneously.
There are a lot of "hot dogs."
As for candy, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lozenges, candies and gum.
That is good news for the 41 million people, according to U.S. Department of Commerce, with the slogan "trick or Treat" move by the district.
Indeed, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - let us not deceive ourselves - eat.
The only thing that we do not want to consume, the sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless sold around 15 million kilograms of Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturer.
That is about nine billion maize grains.
It is a mystery that I still could not resolve.
Halloween is nothing more than houses where it haunts.
They have great names such as "terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, in a real prison), "howl - O - Scream" and "House of Shock."
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States who make $500 million proceeds, America Haunts, which includes the wonderful photos, on which they soon into the trousers and the friends on Facebook, where it will not be rid of them again, and then the guy, which is to leave a comment like "nice expression."
Finally, we come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great War, when we were children, and the carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something that we have made.
Fortunately, the "baby" trend in the pumpkin only last year, thanks to Villepinte rest, so that most of us have grown up with it, not the pumpkin zurechtzuschnitzen and to sit in it.
This year Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins, the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, the slowly rotting in the front yard, in Illinois, where they were harvested this year, 245 million kilograms of pumpkins.
If you want to score correctly, please call Tim and Susan Mathis Don in Napa, California, and convert them to carve its 921 kg pumpkin.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC (Independent Commission Against Corruption) on Friday has extended its investigations on the question of whether Obeid has influenced a number of government ministers to leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids two restaurants and a cafe, without prolonging tender after their expiration in August 2005.
It is now investigating the allegation, Tripodi knew from Obeids concealed interest in the land, after former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole Tripodis testified on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, had urged the government to public tenders for the leases.
Tenants were opposed, and also wanted a longer maturities.
In 2009, the leases for the company at the Circular Quay, which provided the Obeids $2.5 million a year, without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was from February 2006 to November 2009 port minister, had previously argued for public tenders.
But he denied that the changes made at the request of Obeid and Tripodi, who confirmed that the government had been pressing for a review of the lease arrangements.
One of the ICAC's telephone conversations from August and September 2007 showed the characters between Obeid and Tripodi, Steve Dunn, a senior official who was changed into the Ministry of Port, after he had worked in the fishing authority under Obeid.
"Was the issue discussed in these phone calls the development of commercial Verpachtung rules?" Asked the deputy commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi said.
I do not remember what was discussed, but it was not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.

NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a balmy day at the end of August, a German police helicopters flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism (BAT), the German domestic intelligence service, he should shoot the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media wanted the BAT Antennen prove the existence of surveillance and the action led to an exchange of words between the U.S. and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clap Per, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September that the U.S. no possibilities of foreign espionage, "in order to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies, so that they could strengthen their international competitiveness or their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower's former employees, began with the publication of its topics U.S. surveillance Geheimnissen, European governments and corporate executives are more sure if they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and data acquired American cloud provider, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company's paranoia about government surveillance to a new peak.
The last straw was the revelation that was verwanzt Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone, possibly for ten years.
If you can get the most powerful person in Europe, then certainly management potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies to be transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Grün, the president of the BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the U.S. was almost as big a risk as China when it was about industrial espionage and data theft, a survey published in July by the consultancy firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence that the United States have passed the trade secrets of foreign companies to own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU specific IT and Internet options, and they should reduce their dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical.
The Bundestag has been proposed, we should build a German Google.
I can close my eyes and open them again...
"It does not work like that," said Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software maker SAP.
If you had a strong European IT industry, then they should not let die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to automobiles to agriculture.
Everything, except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations shocked firms that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
The cloud computing is a big change, because European business leaders are aware that the data stored in the U.S. case law, and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body that did not according to the disclosures about the U.S. data mining activities with Prism about ten percent of the US-based members plans to use an American supplier.
Jim Snabe, deputy CEO of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago, it is this: Where are saved my data and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this legal area?"
Many German executives believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew: That powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs.
Economic espionage is not a surprise.
This has always been the case.
"It was a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally by the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on commercial and industrial level, as we do that, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
The management does not usually have the countermeasures taken by the attackers, which affords benefits.
In large companies, employees have long taught that the entrainment of a free USB sticks at a trade fair or unguarded behind a laptop in a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich hoes Berk, a board member at automaker Audi, says that it was standard practice for years to collect before a board meeting, the cell phones so that they can not be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BAT advises managers to use simple prepaid cell phones when they go on foreign trips, because smartphones may be compromised.
Prepaid cell phones are thrown away.
There is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and supervision.
In Germany, many of these companies are global leaders in their niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, the personnel and financial resources to protect trade secrets effectively against unauthorized access," warns the BAT in a report.
The U.S. warn companies of their own economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, in second place behind China, Russia and Israel, two of the countries that used for the procurement of economic data from the Hackings.
A member of a German blue-chip company agreed when it was about economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."

He went on to sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he cares.
As it is launched, it will not be long until he is on the "horse of the year" - actor - and I am sure that he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to manage his pony."

More than 325 million Australian dollar rescue package for tasmanisches health care
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions that are associated with the bailout package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government can spend the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis that was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding for a period of four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together a contingency rescue package that is in our view, the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
This includes $325 million emergency aid package of $31 million for electoral services.
Through another 2600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for eye cataracts, residues should be eliminated.
Moreover, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are the ideas that the clinic staff told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A pioneer Commission will set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million would benefit little, if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable rate."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for emergency aid, which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system in the state of the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the state government will be able to make up this election provided most of the recent cuts.
But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "Band-Aid solution."
"We are in today's situation, because the Labor state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said on ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government almost half a billion dollars from the system, and the Commonwealth of 300 million, and then pretend that is the good news.
Dutton Plibersek urged to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.

You could call him the Dostoyevsky in the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God Sucher, a meta physicist, his novels and stories have something serial.
Surprisingly the kinship in the exterior: The stinging eyes, beard, high forehead.
And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with its massive oeuvre as an Ergruender and apologist for the Russian soul, you read Philip K. Dick and American Prophet, which is something in their own country.
Some titles are published in July, the Lagoon Mans cartridge with 118 stories of two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of the breathtaking technological advances, coupled with paranoia and obsession with security and the faith, to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, drugs were added to his brain.
He has already figured out early on that the computer Divinitaeten.
He wrote about a theology of the computer and what differentiates a person from a machine, the creator of his creation.
That is the "blade Runner" - problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
Its stories have inspired filmmakers such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates from 1956, he exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy - tribunals.
It is the principle of "crime," "Crime," that is what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dicks world that resembles our own frightening mutants look into the future - and the police to intervene.
"We record individuals who have violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "There are no criminals in our society, we have a penal camp full of Pesudoverbrecher." You read time flows.
They theorize that is wrong, and that implementing the criminal idea into practice.
Dicks narrative acts as the blueprint for the Anti-Terrorist Act and the NSA's eavesdropping frenzy.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's drones - philosophy works and practice.
But Dicks story is not yet over.
The police chief complained that there was no separation of everyday life - and what is more, the military controlled by the state.
The monitors will be monitored and incorporated a future crime.
The system is.
It is perfect, but it is lying.
It invents its own conditions.
The victims, mistakes and not only in sales, but it is building.
The system creates the danger that it combats.

A court decision to stop - and blocked - Demotika directive of NYPD
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the arrangement of a judge, the changes to the BMW Demotika Program ("stop and search") had demanded of the New York Police Departments, and the judge absolving them from the case.
The 2th U.S. Court of Appeals declared that the decisions of Judge Shira's license would be suspended Dlin until an appeal is decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city would offend the Constitution with the way the programme will be implemented for stopping and questioning people.
The city appealed against their judgment and ordered corrective measures, including the decision to set up a supervisory body that should support the police in changing the directive and the corresponding training program.
The Court of Appeal on Tuesday heard the arguments of the suspension.
The report, the judge declared appeal should be relieved from the case because they have violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by is that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly due to a series of media interviews and public statements, in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were unduly targeted black and Latin American men with the BMW Demotika program.
It has appointed an outside agency to monitor the implementation of key changes, including reforms to policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program at the body cameras in neighborhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York, ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were sacked after checks by the police.
A consideration of the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The BMW Demotika - tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Such controls are there for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls rose during the term of the independent elected mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
2004 out of four men who were all minorities, taken the case, which became a class action.
Supporters say the changes in the BMW Demotika - program of the NYPD, the changes are unfair practices and create a more reliable and more effective police force and influence the way the scheme to use other police chiefs.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; it would waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that is after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that the BMW Demotika - practice concludes that is constitutional, reformiere but only the type of application of controls by the NYPD.

Anger over sentence for Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202, 2002 people who were killed in the bombing in Bali, were angered by the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was brought to justice, as Umar Patek, in their view, should be shot without allowing them.
Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most sought-after people in Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to 20 years in prison.
With the suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, have been injured and many more.
A guilty verdict was also in a number of terrorismusbezogener charges, which included a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, even if it is the man who, because of his reputation as a wordless bomb maker known as "Demolition Man," could have requested the death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Cort Een, a mother from Perth, which lost its 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the Patek and his Mitverschwoerern devastation caused almost ten years ago.
Fighting back tears, she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"We should put him in front of a firing squad," said Cort Een to AAP.
I have to live with every day that I will not get another grandson and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club has been razed to the ground, and exploded on 12 October 2002, shortly after 23 pm a huge bomb in a small truck that was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber exploding a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and "died" thrice, while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek have deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samu Dra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should have before any other to the death penalty.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get in 20 years after he killed 202 people and many hundreds injured, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.
He eluded almost a decade after the arrest, but was picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces nearly four months later, the former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden killed.
During the negotiation of a FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the reference that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"He has not arisen," said Cort Een.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which will be celebrated with commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Cort Een.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.

Red traffic lights to ensure waiting time.
Sometimes it is simply not a traffic light green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light signal is broken.
What do you do - red?
Some people have waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, the Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "motorcycle."
But the waiting time must be "appropriate" what could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker recommends to endure at least five minutes before it can be a disorder of traffic lights.
If the ride continues, despite Rotlichts, must, however, bear in mind that it makes for an accident caused by the full blame.
Those who tolerated less than five minutes, may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the High Court of Hamm.
In the current case, a driver for about three minutes, the duration of red lights and had to answer for a negligent Rotlicht violation.
The traffic was not broken, but later jumped on Green.
A driving ban was spared because of the special situation - but not the fine.

Profit at Bombardier after decline in supply figures and contracts
The Canadian plane and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15 percent decline in net profit, after he was advised by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, a flight test data for his brand-new aircraft of the contract and gave no new information about whether the plane could go according to the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft so far, only three other launches were followed by a year and a half months, which makes it doubtful whether the testing phase is proceeding as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of "outperform" from "sector perform" in view of the fact that the shares in the next one to two quarters a limited rate potential.
"Even though there are fewer delivery figures for aircraft detection, but clearly we are disappointed by the margins of development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a client note.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the contract, if the test program is progressing for the plane.
But if there are no new orders in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the aircraft of the contract can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented in March after months of delays and flew to the public for the first time in September.
But so far are binding orders for the contract with 177 moderate, because potential buyers want to wait and see the results of the flight tests whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new Duesen transport aircraft.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin, Bombardier is confident that it will achieve its goal of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.
Corporate governance also assured on Thursday with analysts and media, the program is in the schedule.
"The test plane is no longer expected to remain on the ground," Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that during the life of the aircraft had been scheduled soil tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer is different.
We have decided to take a first flight and attach an Ueberarbeitungs period, what we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight program.
The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, it said on the part of companies.
However, analysts remain skeptical that it can take twelve months after the maiden flight of a plane's first customer of the contract.
Bombardier said that it checked the planning for the start-up (EIS) and will update this in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter with the end of September 30 Bombardiers net profit to $147 million, or 8 cents per share fell by $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share was unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales slipped slightly, and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a gain of 10 cents per share, and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell by 83 to 26.
The order book in the aerospace division was on September 30, 32.9 billion dollars and was unchanged compared with December 31.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and market relations as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area has risen by nearly eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector, on September 30, 32.6 billion dollars and was increased to 31 December.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been hampered by Abwicklungs problems on some large contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier shares by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that it will also change the Google CFO Patrick Pich, to the Board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardiers closest rival, reported on Thursday a% drop in quarterly profit.

Rules on electronic devices on planes in Australia remain in force for now
Australian airline passengers continue to switch to tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing in the US, despite efforts to ease the rules for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will allow U.S. airlines to change their guidelines, so that passengers can read on their instruments during critical flight phases, e-books, videos, if they can see or play in the "flight mode."
While the bulk of the flight is already allows passengers, but many people find it annoying that they can't read at the start and landing their e-books.
Australian companies must do to implement the decision to watch the American airlines a ton of work, but have no immediate plans to change its rules.
The air traffic control agency CASA, also said it will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical flight phases in Australia.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations on use of electronic devices on the plane," has been forthcoming.
The issue is subject to rules that maintain security at any time according to airlines and passengers must follow from the crew's safety instructions.
Virgin has already led to the CASA and said talks on an useful extension of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, it is open to changes, but these would have to be initiated by the legislators.
"We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, having now (wireless entertainment) during the flight," a spokesman said.
Qantas said that it will remain until further notice in the current regulations.
"Our current guidelines that must not be used in electronic devices during takeoff and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
We are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and will look at the FAA decision, and certainly the reasons behind it.
The decision has an impact on U.S. companies vary depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage and customer base Weisung.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of their fleet, it can be easier for passengers to use portable electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smart phones at every level," the FAA announced.
In rare cases, poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers, while the main landing gear.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment for takeoff and landing safely under the seat or to store in the lockers.

Scientists have been able to throw more light on what the relationship is with the capable of creatively organizing his mood.
Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail stretched out to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while it was in nervous dogs the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs these subtle differences can perceive and respond to it.
Professor Giorgio Vall Orti Gara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also pointed out that in dogs as in humans, the right brain hemisphere is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the side of their tail, the researchers monitored the animals, while others saw these movies.
They measured heart rate of dogs and analyzed the behavior.
Soon we are likely to understand why the tail in the first, in the other direction
Professor Vall Orti said: "We have shown the Gara dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
If the animals saw how an otherwise ausdrucksloser dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they are able to relax completely.
But it was left to the tail of the dog that wags perspective (again), increased their heart rate and they saw restless.
According to Professor Vall Orti Gara deliberately the dogs do not communicate with each other by these movements.
Instead, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, what movements they should not be worried, and when.
He said: "When it comes to encounters with other dogs and is the perfect place with the tail in a direction more with friendly behavior and produces the right-hand page is a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada was as follows: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog that wags his tail" of left and right, rather than in the Italian study to be restless - precisely the other way around. "
According to his testimony could stir the differences so that interpretations of the dogs in the various studies of animals in films or the robot dogs and dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said.
"Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still must be determined and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
Because of their behavior, but simply record will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes in one direction, sometimes the other.

Pawnshops in Singapore are booming, because the crisis is in the middle class
In a pawn shop in the mall Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga a gold clasp, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, because my money in there," says Amirthalinga.
Although the 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros per month) and her husband earn an administrative assistant, not the monthly family income, she explained.
Indeed, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where the indebtedness of households - so great that Value Max, where they made their exchange, this week became the third pawn, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The Verpfaenden of jewellery is not only a faster way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as good as an unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops typically charge an annual interest rate of 17 percent in Singapore, which is barely above the 15.4 percent demanded by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
But the advantage that there is no proof of income or credit review pawnshops provide needed loans, which are faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region to pawnshops after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and growing budget and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans from a loose monetary policy in developed economies with lower and middle-income families are looking for pawnshops to compensate for the difference in doddering economy.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly by rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the agency's highest fiscal debt relative to GDP in Asia.
Malaysia, with 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged this week, just from a technical recession.
The data on Thursday showed a persistent weakness in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"In effect, this means that people in the face of rising costs in the middle to bottom of the income scale (segment) will try to supplement their income, wherever possible," said Song Seng long, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices in the last two years, the trend for pledging personal items increased, because people use the opportunity to transform the family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the 200 pawn shops in the city state.
People say: "The price of gold looks good, let us bring Grandmother's gold chain, and next month."
The largest Thai pawn shop operator, Easy Money, has experienced in its subsidiaries a 20 percent increase in customers in recent months.
Growth in the pawn business is so strong that Value Max, operator of the branch in Singapore and 15 other Bendemeer, wants to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where the company operates four houses, but also outside Asia, Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of Value Max.
The company financed with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it took this week with the listing in Singapore.
While some lenders are experiencing due to high interest rates in the crossfire, yeah, that does not pawnshops only lower interest rates than other lenders, but also the debt increase.
"Customers pawned items that they already have, and the film does not increase the Haushaltsverschulung personal valuables," she explained.
The mortgage lending business is socially accepted as increasingly short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people use the pawn shop, in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore come into the branches of Value Max to Rolex watches, gold bars and what they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Come to us customers from every social class.
"These include haves that lend something short term for a business or an investment, or small companies, have to overcome the bottlenecks in the cash flow," said Yeah.
Sometimes they simply need money very fast.

A study by the British government has announced to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd is proposed, with the start of Phase 1 in 2026 high-speed rail links between Scotland and the north of England.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer, said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail line between London and northern England by £32.7 billion to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, HS2 Ltd, asked for more routes and travel time improvements in northern England and Scotland.
These include the possibility of an eventual travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network, which brings together Britain and its cities."
We are moving ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a Kapazitaets crisis in our network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alistair campaign commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown campaign to make "absolutely clear" for the Scottish involvement into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also the economic power of Scotland at the same time provides an argument for high-speed rail links across Great Britain."
We are therefore pleased to work as partners with the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, the benefits for all and completes the connection Glasgow - Edinburgh, the Scottish Government's plans.
I look forward to examining the report with the British ministers next year and to jointly adopt the next steps.

D i e solution is not for old age.
Even those who could afford the residency in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could be ill.
And: "Without good knowledge of the language vereinsame in Dolce Vita," warns the book Autorin Aussiedlung Willi gene.
Among their models are classic forms of childcare models, alternative housing or the oft-quoted pensioners - WG.
At the age of each of his ticks and quirks
"For me it would be nothing but a residential community," she says with a wink.
Certainly not like in a student house with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In the age simply takes its retreat," said Ries.
A senior residential community that can work, however, do not want to exclude the book author.
But then it must be different from the classic students - WG.
And sometimes you just want only his rest, "she believed.
She is hardly alone, at least in the state capital.
"The majority of old people in Stuttgart will remain as long as it is in their own apartment," is also the experience of Theresa Ruetten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the provincial capital.
The department advises people about "age."
So often, elderly people would just take inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment buildings.
Ries recommends that all those who deal with this conversion of their house or an apartment to find out not only to hire the best craftsmen.
Today, there are specialists for this transformation.
Even in the rental apartment will be realized one or the other, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, clarifies the interior designer.
But not always, reconstruct the existing flat age and thus accessible, even if it is still as beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
While you could install a stair lift, which is also in the apartment with a cobblestone path to the door, but the far greater obstacle.
It will proceed until it has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.
Before the parade will hate it more than before the spider on their front door.

Cocaine Abhaengiger lawyer, warned the drug boss, police investigation, will go to prison
Basha, 42, was processed by Council information on underworld size Neil Scarborough on
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal lawyer who warned a druglord facing a major police investigation, because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basha processed Council, 42, supplied with sensitive information about investigations into its activities in the drug-trafficking underworld size Neil Scarborough, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The Kriminalisten as a "first-class" vaunted lawyer nicknamed "Bash" was arrested in 2011 in his house after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the prosecutor in Blackburn, Lancashire, had done, while it was with colleagues at a dinner of the bar.
The investigations have revealed that class A drugs regularly processed consumed after tests on traces of cocaine in his hair, were found in his wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to gain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were at the time by the police as part of a major investigative procedure for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people were arrested and later, after ensuring the police raids on a number of heroin and cocaine, worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
He, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction can be publicised.
Today it was processed, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, convicted and sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court after a two week trial for obstruction of justice charges.
He gave on a previous survey the cocaine possession.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found in their investigations of Scarborough in February 2011 that it had been in regular telephone contact with disappointment.
Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas house and put the drug with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove in the dustbin of the law.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, called Scarborough regularly with disappointment over who was at a dinner in a football stadium in the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs and then exchanged nine communications between the two.
In court, it became known that disappointment over "was a" regular consumer of cocaine after the class A drugs tests in his hair, his wallet had been found and on its credit cards.
He was arrested later, but denied to take cocaine and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because his client, and claimed that their discussion is governed by the "secret law."
During his arrest, disappointment over his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and he was taken from a hair sample.
During police interrogation, he admitted that he got from both his private address and an office in the workplace, and clients would call him at home because of legal matters.
In court, it became known that some important players in the drug trade, some of which he had represented before, called for significant arrests and informed about what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone that does not break the law."
He is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer, because he has admitted too much with certain clients.
The relationship is not simply that of a drug Haendlers, but a drug Haendlers who supplied his lawyer with drugs.
One of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
It was the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr expressed his disappointment over the profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed that its independence was compromised.
He rejected any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing superintendent Lee Halstead said: "Mr processed by the police in Lancashire has taken the step of a criminal defendant to a criminal when he began to acquire drugs by organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organised crime, which instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity in the public and for trust and confidence.
He has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his career.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire headed the investigation against disappointment over that led to a conviction in three for possession of cocaine and judicial obstruction, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Thirty five other people were convicted on drug trafficking "to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, disappointment over a range of questions and answers about where he said he was his dream job is as a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work.

Council takes track systems targeted
"The deers" transition to the extensive rebuilding in order to improve road safety?
Yes, local councils have decided.
Schiltach, for 220,000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve next year, has brought forward the rail route.
In particular, to increase the safety of railroad crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
The rebuilding of the communities, they must participate with one third of the cost, the rest share and covenant.
Schilt Achs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council on the specifics of the Bahuebergangs "deer."
There, the city plans to build the tunnel in Mundes west of the railway tracks a bulge.
There may be bigger cars, for example, those carrying logs, are at oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could widen the street from time to time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed in the municipal council is controversial because some councillors questioning the need for road expansion: Thomas Kipp, the mood of the critics, saying: "We have to take so much money for so few vehicles in the hand?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "deer" will be used regularly for long wooden Transporte.
Even wood from the area, in part, "Kuhbach" will be transported via this route because they could not use the vehicles up to 20 metres the track at the Haeberle bridge, because they could not turn to the main street.
Moreover, the line serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
It is clear that Kirch would have to be rebuilt and renovated mountain and Schlossberg tunnel, as is currently the case, the Wolf River "on" deer "also have an important traffic for a longer period.
The council agreed to investigate what's intended enlargement costs would cause the street.
Regardless of the reconstruction of the railway was agreed by a majority of transition with the proviso that the retaining wall is being built so that the city's subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstrasse" for meeting traffic could eventually expand to around 5.5 meters.
The renovation of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein may have a different problem, the access to the steeply rising "Geroltzhaeuser path" concerns.
The administration had to examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger, because she had doubts about whether the planned end of the Geroltzhaeuser way then possible.
The investigation concluded that it is not excluded that the tilt of the street could lead to "prolonged vehicles.
The responsibility for this, in turn, enter the city as a Straßenbaulasttraegerin.
The disputes could drag the liability.
Because both worked wood collection and turning in the current state of development, should they not agree to the reconstruction of the rail crossing, Haas argued.
At this point is also the risk of a collision of turn with a vehicle in the transition to much lower than in the other crossings, because is the next stop in the middle, which is a good view.
Even the streets, even at this point would have to be slowed down as far as that of a collision.
The reconstruction of this train, because the city's consent has been denied by the majority of the problem with aufsitzenden Schiltach vehicles "would have to pay," said the councils, which could withdraw the train after the construction of the responsibility.
The Panel considers as problematic the conversions of the crossings "in Heubach" and "Kuhbach," Kreuzungs agreements already made for the train.

Ben Green Man: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that is New York City the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago began the Variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Starboys at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, innovation has been very pretty, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and headed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carol Ines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and theaters.
"Most of these began with Carol's headliner, and were always successful, until it became too well known to act in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event, there are appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy fundraising event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, which, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Anderson.
The festival has grown in the world of comedy.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year, have become known in more unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom in the cable television (the irony - & nbsp; raunchy fantasy football series "the League" on MC12) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was both "Saturday Night Live" and "parks and Recreation" part of the occupation, although best known for their viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, pessimistic view on racial issues, W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest magnets for visitors of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, has developed into a reputable television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television program entitled "Sit Down Comedy With David Steinberg" in TV land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He has told me if he is here, sometimes he would go through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, I live here.

Australian sets appeal against a prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison, because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was the first by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15, found guilty of making a false statement, having entered the Thai police, a local taxi driver took them in the morning on Sunday, 10 June, raped, while two other men grabbed them.
Later, however, the photographs showed a video camera that it became safe in their hotel after they had been separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police interrogated Bamford for two days in Phuket until they confessed to fabricating the story.
Until the trial is in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison with a low security level in Phuket, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rugby League, who has appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family is "extremely worried" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have them back to Australia.

RBS suspended two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation in the currency market sharply.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation into the world's largest financial market where the $5.3 trillion.
The two traders, the first RBS employees, who have been suspended in the widening investigation of the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which made no comment about the suspensions, confirmed this month that they have received information from authorities.
"Our investigations are continuing on this issue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation that the RBS the records of emails and instant messages that were sent to and from a former trader at the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, have passed.
The trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is said to be now leave from his current position as an European head of the forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, "my mother was a senior currency trader at Barclays earlier this week and Matt Gardiner, and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing.
The Instant Message Group of Usher, bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, individuals close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of their employees, after the Swiss regulator Finma said that it may determine an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA and the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - currently dealing with accusations that bankers have agreed to transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal inquiries or receive information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of this research has enabled the trader in an area in turmoil, which has heard in recent years become one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks this year, but was under pressure because of low volatility in currencies, the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A senior dealer said that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the growing use of internal platforms by banks that "you can influence with very low ticket prices."
The news came on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced this week that it had terminated a dealer of London Exchange Traded Funds - offices, at the end of last year after he had caused a loss of almost $six million.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and is cooperating with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," said Credit Suisse.

Coulson, phone hacking tips for checking of a
The former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, supposedly "phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World in May 2005, heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mails, and they followed, but Coulson also called and left messages, such as the court was told.
"According to the prosecutor, Coulson, who is now publisher of the NotW, no one is above the apartment of people and hopes to catch them red-handed, but one that faced with a history of people like to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said NotW use three methods to investigate stories citizen investigators: Phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows from the second, the surveillance, it cannot be changed.
What about the first?
He knows about the phone hacking?
He continues to deny this, but we say: "And if he knew about it."
Clarke's rumours of an affair were first taken up by the feature editors of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles."
A band with voice mail from their phone has been secured by at least three occasions in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, Pawlby and her sister as "projects" were saved.
When the research, the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, I would like to speak with Charles."
Edis said, followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett Coulsons activities in this story.
On Thursday, the jury heard that Coulson Blunkett was confronted with an affair with a married woman, when he was stable even with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that to have conspired with others, between October 3, 2000 and 9. August 2006 to hack phones.
Weatherup and Thurlbeck and Mulcaire have admitted the phone hacking.

Early puberty: Up Fast
African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be more likely than their white age mates whom studies show.
Physical changes do not mean immediately puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the epidemic of obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend of early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
A mother should be worried if her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Medical Association children this week in Orlando, Florida, declared the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes among American girls are relatively normal and a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - normally there is no indication that now the puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, shame and Achsel hair and body odor, among girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the onset of first menstruation) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the development of breasts, it takes at least two to three years to menarche," Kaplowitz said, also author of the book "early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this problem often encountered."
Time is the most accurate test of how the pace of puberty.
It is a controversial issue, which is indeed the beginning of puberty, but it is "precocious," if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt at the age of eight years.
In most cases, slowing down the process or - something that can monitor a pediatrician.
For faster progress could be shown by an Endikronologen tests in order to prevent serious problems like tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bone that can ultimately lead to growth and thus Hemmung small body size in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reticent about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can lessen behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different than their age."
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want to see her very young daughters of the period.
"They are worried about the Schwangerschafts risk or how they handle hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter was with her in ten days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, they were not prepared emotionally.
She was scared and excited by the school home because she was the first in their circle of friends.
There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Young girls are similar to those used in puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported a study of the 2001 girls aged six to nine, which establishes a connection between body fat and the transition to adolescence.
Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be more likely than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Global seems influenced by all sorts of things to be an early adolescence, from economic conditions on the climate to the genes.
Another conundrum: Although a growing boy's face and pubic hairs earlier, the trend is not so strong as to a full earlier puberty in girls.
Other doctors on the Piezon ® - Conference stressed the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even among babies and young children.
"We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician, how they should talk with their child.
"This may mean that you must hold a meeting sooner than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, normally the child responded well.
Girls who bloom early, need the insurance, which is a normal part of life, even if it happens earlier than thought.

Before the derby against Schalke had roiled mitgereiste BVB trailers with flares for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund has vowed harsh consequences.
Before the anniversary of the Football League game against the Ultras VfB Stuttgart responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German champions Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
The guests were predominantly to hear fans with their chants.
By contrast, the southern gallery, where the most loyal of loyal - and loudest - BVB fans, was very quiet: No chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the Capo, which coordinates the common spirit, remained unfilled.
And quite lonely on the front of the grandstand blew a large flag with the inscription "stadium."
Only entered as a goalkeeper, as always, Feller became the first player - the court, brandete short-run jubilation.
When his team mates, there was vociferous singing and a few hours, long scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South, there was nothing.
Even the positive experiences of the last few days, that stadium spokesman Norbert II - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, extend the contract of coach Juergen Klopp - recited, not for celebration.
Only five minutes before the whistle, climbed the podium - and until then, with hands tangible tension erupted into a loud cry, a restaurant had II, as usual, the mood on the terraces at the stadium.
Finally, as always, the gallery's turn again as usual - and finally was the loudest place in the stadium.
And when the whistle blows from the south gallery the full-throated call "Derby winner is on" everything came back, as always.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of recent days.
Just before the derby at the FC Schalke 04 had fired some of the cheerers have filled the BVB trailers flares into the spectators and the place and almost goalkeeper Roman willow Feller.
The game was also delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
Course - boss Hans-Joachim Watzke was Dortmund's leaders had received in his office and is believed Watzkes words, this was for the Fanvertreter a rather cheerless deadline.
"There will be for the entire movement of massive cuts," proclaimed the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, coaches forbade the Ultras choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have been banned," he said.
The zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics, we can not give up.
It has also shown the Ultras different ways of punishment - until Tuesday, this time to choose.
Otherwise, Watzke, will define the BVB a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is serious," said Watzke.
It will be interesting to see how the reactions to the south grandstand.

What happens on the road with my email?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
The draft was implemented Internet e-mail service similar to conventional mail, the letter secret?
In the design of the early Internet services, the priority has been to make communication possible.
Therefore, it has not respected the basic technical protocols to create a stable foundation for an anhoersicheren correspondence.
It is a traditional e-mail more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" and "Benn" to send a message to the computers of the two directly?
The e-mail program or browser of Anna's first sends an e-mail to the mail server of your service provider.
If it has, for example, a GMail account, it would be Google.

Germany's biggest state church has Offensivegestartet, to promote the work of the pastor.
Background is a shortage of priests, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hannover, expects that it will halve the number of their roughly 1,800 Pasto and pastors to present situation until 2030.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the safety and life itself.
With Burfien instructed the State Church for the first time, a pastor at a full place to inspire young people to the program.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating from high school to study theology.
Burfien leads back to the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is."
It is the work of great freedom and diversity.
I can inform Mr my calendar and my priorities, where it is important to me.
Although pastors may be as close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly in the free economy will pay more, but it would have a secure employer theologians.
The young people of today, not only about career, but a meaningful work.
According to the State Church, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently receives annually about 60 pastors to retire.
At the same time, starting about 40 graduates of the Augustinian theology studies.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or Wendland could be struggling to fill posts in the future.
Burfien wants, among other things, training sessions for young people and invite the celebrities who have studied theology.
The program offers a broad education.

Hearing before the Royal Commission, charged with two YMCA staff members before allegations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA staff members from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 charges have been levelled against the children, Jonathan Lord, Caring Bah, told the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children.
But at the opening statement before the Commission of the YMCA, said it was "never in the organization had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse."
Managing director Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employees had been accused of any wrongdoing with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caring Bah Hall 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him had been condemned.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer that he knew from the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA of the Commission was also inaccurate in saying, "there was external inspections of the YMCA, which was recognised by the YMCA as a frontline in the children's safety."
Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second lowest score of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) has received in August of this year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management of the "failed" by me in the recruitment of Lord and do not ensure that employees are aware of their obligations to report violations of the rules on child safety.
Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offenses involving twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had held a cultural problem and the employees to report violations of the Lords regarding the safety of children.
The employees testified that they had observed violations, among other things, that was Lord alone with children, they privately as a babysitter, she was sitting on his lap, said that he was a loving, and children playing with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose boss Lord was and had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was worried for his behavior, said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat, who was in the YMCA Caring Bah, the Lords, "was very daunting and very remote to most of the time."
The Managing Director has stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, it has affected their friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they have not reported.
Hare explained that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organization from the "Jonathan Lord incident," said, "this" was not by employees, and the board voted to approve him.
Hare said that the decision to push the employees to sign non-disclosure agreements shortly after the accusations, the managing director of the YMCA's children's services, Liam Whitley, had been taken.
He said that this should be avoided contamination of evidence, which has been implemented but "overzealous" and bad.
The YMCA NSW is in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, there have been no safe organization for children, said Professor Stephen Small Bone from Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse, the Commission.
He explained that "serious problems" in the recruitment, screening, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.

Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At around 120 metres in length is kept below a sewage channel from Cologne from the Roman era.
Visiting the cathedral of Cologne, is not over.
About 157 meters of the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest church building of Europe.
But few visitors who visit the two slender spires, guessed that locals are under the cathedral, a lot.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the underworld.
Meeting place for its leaders, the service center of Cologne - tourism directly on the cathedral.
The tour has very unspectacular beginnings: "We are in the garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted an autogerechte city, and therefore stopped by the remnants of the old city wall, which was not too big.
Most users of the Park House today therefore come to the Roman ruins and put their car.
But if you look more closely, discovered in the parking deck, separated by metal Gitter Staebe archaeological site.
About five meters high are unfortunately ruins of stones.
"There are remains of the Roman town wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D.," says Schulze.
Before going back to the surface, Schulze participants on the upper level is a glimpse into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is perceived.
Next stop of the tour is the Pretorian, and here the participant back down into the depths.
We are seeing here once the office of the most powerful man in the north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.
What does CCAA, wants to know a visitor.
"The acronym stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Aggripinensium, "which in English means" city of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the imperial cult "means."
And the Pretorian is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman empire at the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel entrance to the Roman sewer channel, which is here given to around 120 metres.
"You can walk quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you like," encouraging Schulze guests.
Schulze has a surprise.
After he took office the key, he leads the group with a 16 meters deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in a mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he says.
The Jewish community built its dip deep into the ground to get water, which was the reason for the ritual washing.
To date, at the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on Town Hall Square, for which construction is to begin shortly.
But it will take some years to complete.

George Kere Van: European unbundling gives the Scots the election
A new day, a new Schreckens history of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the key word for stories of passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the Hadrian's Walls.
Indeed, it was pointed out in the template forming on the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was - as expected - in the headlines.
No one even mentioned that the EU member states often bent their strict rules, if it is more advantageous to them.
Since Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.
That is not really a story.
And one that has occurred in the years that it already looks like a fossil: The first time I used the "independence means passport controls at least 40 years ago," duck heard.
This is an interesting point in the continuous replay of this ancient history.
Why should you expect from an independent Scotland that it is at the European pipe?
Why the London exchange against the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The large, adopted after the war plan for the unification of Europe is stalled.
With the euro crisis the European project is dead.
Parties are gaining ground everywhere in the EU, are hostile to the EU - or want to have the euro as their common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany - until this year - almost five million votes in the federal election in September, and thus effectively for the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, as a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket into which is forced the national economy by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments will cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial to German exporters and the German politicians would want to leave.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency is southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut public spending and wages - spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems, a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and gas fourfold.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world does not reward hard Schreibungen protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into a corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the EU saw France's political elite as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and could keep Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Paris and Berlin does not need more than gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has put its own economic policy, which the struggling French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing National Front, hostile to the EU has just won a crucial by-election and the ruling Socialists in three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it can expect a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What makes Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working-class French?
They want to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti- common currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and that is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to: In the not-so-distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency, to the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it is more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) nations, the General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain distanced itself from this project in the hope of cosying up to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic.
Where does Scotland in all this?
We can determine a region by (ultimately) to be small - England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including Brussels, Berlin and say what they want to hinstecken.
I suspect that Scotland could run a looser European union quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of the Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider that Norway do well and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has 2011 spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and) cuts made by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to impose an austerity policy in Berlin and Brussels.

FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no cell phone conversations)
Passengers can now from departure to landing their electronic devices to read, listen to music, games, activities and use the prestige of films, but not with your mobile phone, according to the new guidelines, which on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published in the US.
But passengers should not expect that these changes be implemented immediately.
How fast they were implemented, would depend on the respective airline, Michael Huerta, FAA employees at a press conference.
The FAA, the airlines must demonstrate that aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew, as well as the rules for the storage of the devices under the new rules.
The FAA said that she had already received plans by some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Under these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the plane doors are closed.
You can start only once the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain the go-ahead.
At the entrance to the runway, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again until the plane landed.
Under the new guidelines could airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference, the devices also allow its passengers to start, landing and use on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other planes that were adapted for the use of Wi-Fi in larger amounts, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented, and we are working closely with the airline about this together - will benefit both sides," commented Glading.
Frankly, we are sorry to have to feel on this subject as watchdogs.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the agency explained.
Passengers will be asked to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
"Words With Friends," is still not online, the Scrabble game that played the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he is an American Airlines jet had to leave because he refused to switch the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops should continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
In-flight cell phone conversations are also banned.
The regulatory authority for phone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA lifts ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing may be
Last month, said Mark Rosen of the Transportation Security Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, an expert on national transportation issues at CBS News, cellphones would still be considered as a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that can disrupt the transfer stations," said Rosen, also from the air.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, suggested last month that the government will permit a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use.
Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, as critics represented the view that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are more difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies say that up to a third of the passengers are missing or ignored the closure of the unit.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travelers had become, after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment brought in by passengers VHF radios that were then the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that comprise them electronic interference.
Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the flight is reached.
The Wi-Fi systems, pilots are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-mail reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if umblaettert.
But when it comes to downloading or sending data transmission values are stronger.
Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the devices used by passengers is Amazon.com.
2011 firm employees invited an airliner full of Kindle e-book reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could find none.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd said the passenger association, National Association of Airline Passengers that he believes that the distraction of the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who did speak for a malfunction of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to land in poor visibility conditions instruments in the closure of the devices by the passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing them as a proper adjustment for travelers who extensively today would be equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that there is not a pleasant experience at odds with the safety of passengers," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.

The city hosts: Fast actions surprise
With a small cadre of the gentlemen I TSV Freudenstadt in Schiller - school gym in Reutlingen against the TG Goenningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Aelbler, faced with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
But it soon became apparent that they, too, could not keep up with the quick actions of the Staedter joy.
The Goenninger is placed with the tough and extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly through the net in the middle of second-hand passports and attacks and were not on the block defence.
Two high profits in the first sentence of the joys Staedter in all aspects.
In the face of this suffocating and spielbestimmenden performance then became the third sentence somewhat lax and listless at 3:0 - Endstand (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
Since November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, who prevailed in Nagold, are a much more powerful opponents on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Neue Buechle, Sebastian Doel Ker, Felix Paelchen, Stefan Raeller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class stood in the Murg valley in Baiersbronn Freudenstadt and Baiersbronn in the second teams.
They provided a competitive two hour match.
Nervousness on both sides, especially with the ball passing errors and points gifts; sometimes the precision of the passports was scarce, and in some critical game scenes prevented the eagerness to look for possible point gains.
In this very balanced encounter was a testament to the TSV team by Marcus Blasutto but all the great physical effort and a high level of commitment from both teams.

Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the people early on in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the Hochwasser protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had arrived in the town hall in order to explain the measures planned to ask questions, raise concerns and ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The ultimate decisions make the members of the parish council."
The flooding, which Gechingen on May 15, 2009, was unprepared, was a crucial event, which raised the question of protection measures for the future, Häußler.
A river area investigation had been given with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the Hochwasser protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of cultivated land is the goal," says Häußler.
It is actually planning the protection of a statistically every 100 years, according to the German weather service expected floods.
Climate change is driven by a 15% surcharge.
In expert circles, with 100 aKlima "HQ."
The floods that had led to considerable damage, Gechingen in 2009, a 1000 -year flood.
"There is not an absolute protection, but a relative improvement we can achieve," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100 aKlima, must be invested in Gechingen around EUR four million, and the community can expect with country subsidies amounting to around 70 percent.
But Häußler pointed out that there is promoting only if an overall concept will be implemented.
The community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case, could be started in 2016 with the implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept that already was presented last week in the municipal council for these local measures to stem the flow of the river from the Confirm Valley.
Following the presentation of the Hochwasser protection concept gave the participants the opportunity to present their case.
Among other things, questioned why are no longer planned dams and reservoirs to protect the village.
Gregor Kuehn, designer of the contracted engineering firms and Corbe from Huegels home, who presented the concept, stressed that the interplay of all these measures needed to achieve the desired goal.
Moreover, it is required to find the most economical solution, Joachim forest of forest and Corbe.
Resentment among countries bordering the Altorts who suffer even with normal thunderstorm rain again under a canal network congestion.
The problem is to manage and first measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for canal systems than others, should not be confused for flood protection and so on.
The community was obliged to interpret the channel network so that it could be two to cope with the rain events.
The sewers must have greater, could cost millions.

Jumbo manufacturers are arguing in the face of large orders on seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers has given rise to an argument about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers during long flights in economy class - not always the ones to make airlines, but most of these designated areas is the key to efficiency claims with the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that a seat width of 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, says the American rivalry between Boeing, the airlines should decide.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell bigger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and at the event from 17th to 21th November expect record orders.
What is the structure of the rear of the aircraft - especially if there are nine or ten rows of seats - is crucial to the economic results that the new "mini Jumbo" is supposed to provide.
Boeing claims its new "777 X" will be 406 people in seats in economy class, about 17 inches wide, and ten per series.
Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 astutely 350 persons in 18 -inch wide seats in economy class, where there are nine per series.
Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertising in the press.
Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, which will make the 777 X with more than 100 orders for the race, directly to the public.
The company recently unveiled an ad that the beginning of a new ad war, donors could and showed a picture, in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
People with different dietary habits are thicker, but plane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, and the end of the century defined the modern long-haul travel has increased the weight of the average American males between 40 and 49 years by ten percent, according to the data of the U.S. health ministry.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21th century, according to U.S. health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept in the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized "jet set" was narrow.
We have, Airbus, investigations that documented that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat will sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputed Airbus says the numbers on the seat Maßen and that it is not up to the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between flight tariffs and establishment.
The company also stated that the experience in the aircraft, according to research by more than the seat width.
"It is really intended to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," says the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They do not want to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers is about more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the confrontation is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the export performance of the U.S. or Europe.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the Sitzlayout the driving force behind the battle for new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing are 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365 -seater Boeing 77 - 300 ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the 777 X is compared with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently with ten seats per row.
"Boeing squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, director for passenger comfort in the European Airbus.
On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row in the 777s indicated that many passengers have opted for closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper airline fares.
"Eighteen inches of legroom would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view from the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin interior, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which to select the airlines.
The world-travelling jet salesman with a tape measure even contribute to the establishment of the competition and gherkins.
Even if they extol the convenience, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but sold by his own account, not yet.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for greater adaptability of the cabin and offered some jets wide seats on the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets that experts say will evaporate the call for a new industry standard, but probably could distract from the wave of 777 X - sales.

According to the lexicons of veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism, but this is different in a significant way.
While vegetarians, eating ice cream cake, or a powerful Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Vega's.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the waiver of meat and fish, the vegans from all consumption of animal products - including honey is denied.
What, one might wonder, but a closer look at the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable resourcefulness.
"Sandwich spreads are very popular," says Ute Henkel, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.
He eventually won a vegan for 13 years, he finds M100 (almost) everything that he needs to live. "1997 I asked my diet, and was a vegetarian."
Around the turn of the century, then the next step and I was vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe," says Proctor, who prefers leather and artificial leather.
He recognized that it is also in other everyday matters without animal products.
It is primarily a vegan ethics.
"I do not want that animals have to die for me," says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, who covers the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of burgers, hinterherzutrauern scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegans quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm went up.
"It is a double bonus today," says Proctor, "indeed, his vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset." The assumption that the one with the diet, the selection of dining options, Proctor more on the power of habit.
These conditions would also fail, and some even well-intentioned attempt.
"The addiction is a crucial factor that many can be quickly abandoned, like smoking," Proctor, a comparison.
A: "Certain tastes and are not in the animal."
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the vegans.
Proctor brings to a barbecue, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Vegan Wuerste.
It is a balanced, varied diet, it should also taste to eat again.
Of course, if you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It is supposed to taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health to eating disorders, a more widespread adoption, he does not have suffered.
The change was a positive aspect for me.
I take no foreign cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively.
"I am checking myself, my blood values are often," Proctor.
Especially against the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus, critics warn.
"When animals are fed with feed, rather than graze on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat that you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 - share high," Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 - values are in order," he says.
Proctor must not go long distances for food procurement.
Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and now every supermarket has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I think.
Only once in a while I buy something special.
"Many people overlooked that only the finished products are expensive, but it is also known as" ordinary "finished products."
It is much cheaper and less time-consuming to prepare vegan meals than is commonly believed.
"There is a lot to explore in the home kitchen, with a few little tips can be good, if not achieve better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor was able to bring his in-laws.
Family celebrations gives the vegans a new seasoning.
This is dynamic, if combined, has a new role.
"The situations that can arise in the process are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
But, of course, he was shown skepticism.
You do not taste my food?
"I feel bad because I drank milk?" - On such issues as vegans must act with sensitivity.
"I do not reject people, yes, I am part of this society," Proctor would live no Enklaven existence.
And, more specifically, the everyday world seems so veganfremd as limited and not sufficient vigour of vegans are all in everyday life.
The fast food is allowed.
Chips are everywhere!
"Many Döner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka," Proctor says.
In a pizzeria he differs on pasta dishes, or simply ordered a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow.
"When I started 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult for me to eat vegan," the New Zealanders, a development that: "You must talk to the people who make it to their attention."
"If enough demand, they are perhaps inclined to complement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or café bird free.
Proctor is the desire that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Essentially, vegan dishes for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, they are exactly the opposite of that.
"Meat dishes are exclusively, in the truest sense of the word, because they preclude others from," Proctor said.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safer way to make it impossible for the most part in the first place," says Proctor.
Purchasing our products can be a little difficult but at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that in peanuts may contain a donor animal additives as a color, it seems to comply with the ethics of so many hurdles and traps to leave quickly for courage.
Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen not only wrote a book, "Vegan Issimo - animal substances and their alternatives," explains the many ingredients, but the food and detergents.
"We know a scanner gradually developed views and the signs and logos," it is sometimes better to do than to stay small steps or to stumble, "Proctor knows.
Of veganism, he is an important moral signal, which is proposing to raise awareness.
Perhaps he can't quite call it his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question its habits.

Bavaria Basketballer despite optimistic first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euro League could not diminish the basketball players of the FC Bayern Munich, the huge optimism.

New nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime of smoking.
Further tests are needed before tests on humans, which can take some years, said Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that we can help this kind of vaccination strategy once millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have tried all methods available on the market, but that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus, the liver cells that produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies in the blood Molekuele hunt the nicotine and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which is a smoker no nicotine.
In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine, their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination would have a "time out" on the other hand, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine have reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science in translational medicine.
Former tobacco Impfstoffe failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be ordered to maintain the antibodies Pegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal, could be a future vaccine for people, if he is sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use to stop him.
"You know: If they are beginning to smoke, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine is no longer enough, and that helps them to overcome the habit," he explained.
British scientists said, the results are interesting, but at the same time warned that further research is necessary.

Egypt's first freely elected president sworn in
Mohamed Morsi, the presidential oath, but his day of triumph may not be the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt," as he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, and thus took over from Hosni Mubarak, was driven from office 16 months ago.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He put the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, which sits on the Nile, and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today the Egyptian people has laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, an U.S. educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been taken since its founding 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organization targeted by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Morsi arrived shortly after eleven pm local time in a small car Konvoi.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court, shouting for joy about the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak era, the traffic was halted only temporarily, so that the Konvoi could cross the busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
The Brotherhood has derided as an uncharismatisches "spare tire" increased his personal prestige in his victory speech and a free day, not only for himself as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the autocratic Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," declared in a blue suit with red tie Morsi dressed the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, in which he gave the oath of office.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem, which he listened in Habachtstellung.
The military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
On his arrival, he was among hundreds of people in the largest university classroom with chants of "the army and the people are one hand" welcomes.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, University of Cairo in the 1970s has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
On Friday, Morsi presented a symbolic oath on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he has vowed to reclaim presidential powers that had been accepted by the Military Council hunted out of office by the head of state.
But with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual in front of the parliament he prevents the will of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech at the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.

Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermters history when men singing club state almost twice as long as that of the Herbs, in which he was honored.
Hubert Wermter was as usual in the colors of his Maennergesangvereines on stage.
Even after 60 years makes him singing with the choir is still cherished today more than great fun.
The association was also actively Wermter, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and loyalty to his club, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral officer on behalf of the Caecilienverbandes Rottenburg-Stuttgart), gave him - there is the choir of a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter, signed by Bishop Gebhard Fuerst.
His singer colleagues presented him the document of the German Choral Association and an engraved Zinn plate.
In addition to honoring the 31th autumn festival in familiar ways: With the MGV Betra, the Stetten salt songs wreath, the singer department Bai, and the local music club carrying full Mar, a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which boasted about 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with songs like "wine paradise" and "funny, their brothers."
Her honor singer Hubert Wermter they still pales as a tribute to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "German song."
The men also sang classical choir vocals of Betra songs like "hunters Werben" by Julius Wengert, "far, far away" by Hubert Goisern, as well as the folk song "when you go through the valley."
The Stetten salt wreath, with its mixed choir and its women's choir group - the "impetus" for the women's quota of the Festival.
The combined voices abducted with the Neapolitan people, "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulse choir" grip on foreign languages: "Libera Tio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singers of Bai's sports club came with "what is the Schwob?" By Hans CDU politician Rita Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "beer song" back in domestic areas, where the full Mar Musikverein, the musical end.
For children, there was a small auxiliary program - "grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stoll, who led a Punch, and read a few stories that deal with children's lunch.

Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines to require plans to $100 for passengers who want to pack in a carry-on bag.
Frontier Airlines intends to up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even if the announcement on Wednesday that passengers would keep the whole box.
The new fee applies for hand luggage in the baggage compartment above the seat, small pockets in the seat remain free.
Frontier said that $25 be emitted if they pay the fee in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O "Malley said that the fee of $100 was intended to encourage travelers to look ahead to the payment.
"We do not want to compute this sum," she said.
Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second checked baggage fees.
Passengers who tried to get around this, therefore, as much as possible in your hand luggage, with the result that the baggage compartments above the seats are crowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O "Malley said, the new fee is not really a question of earning money.
It was the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the box on the seat.
Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger must check in at the gate of Frontier, a piece of luggage for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O "Malley said, the site of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate.
The Frontier's new carry-on fee will only come into force in the summer, there is not yet a specific date.
Passengers often grumbled about luggage fees and other fees, but airlines are happy to back.
They argue that the transport of luggage cost money, and passengers should pay for this service if they wished.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
But so far most of the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. three years ago, was the first to charge for hand luggage and later followed All Giant Air, a budget airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who followed the additional fees.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that bring the hand baggage fee is $50 million per year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious what would await him at the gate when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was a smoothly, which I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected, gnashing and vehement discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he declared, "and the boarding ran as lubricated."
Frontier, Spirit in the $2, for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The companies said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, would keep the entire box of coffee and free.
Water remains free.
In 2008, U.S. Airways tried briefly to demand for soft drinks, but seven months later, after passengers complained and was opposed to any other big company.
Frontiers step to charge for cabin baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative, are to be channeled to the customers on their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to U.S. $25 per ticket sold.
It provides all the companies an incentive to encourage passengers to the direct purchase of them instead of an online travel agency.
But Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to outsource bookings over an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut to 25 percent of the flight.
In a third party booked a flight with Frontier brings more than 1000 miles customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve exclusively for direct purchase on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The proceeds fell by 9%, and the flight capacity fell almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report on Wednesday of the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., was published.
Republic has tried to get as part of the sale of the company's finances from Frontier.

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in the tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose corpse was found in a zusammengerollten Ringer mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a mat set up behind the gallery in the school gym.
The investigators of the Sheriff of One Two County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which contests the family of the 17 -year-olds.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacqueline Lyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed that he had died as it was concluded from the sheriff.
"They are of the view that it was illogical to contravene the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.
Instead, they are convinced that the truth will be concealed in order to protect the person or people who are responsible for the death of her son.
"Her son went to the learning in school and came back in body bags," he commented.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson's, as are a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
His death is the result of a crime?
The declared Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts where they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy interpret that Johnson to the consequences of a "positionsbedingten asphyxiation."
A second autopsy, however, have shown a different cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the Office of County Sheriff was not on our request, immediately to comment on Thursday.
A court in the South Georgias ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the video evidence that he is dead.

John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that the U.S. "espionage" gone too far.
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission softening the defensive attitude of the U.S. in terms of their surveillance programs, saying that espionage is inappropriate in certain cases, "gone too far."
The foreign minister also announced that he would bear the responsibility together with Barack Obama that on "autopilot" have switched, when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblowers Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities.
The leaked information is the U.S. government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a speech transmitted via video link on the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I and others in the government of some things that have happened almost by autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to the 11th of September."
Then, he became the first senior member of the U.S. government that have exceeded the U.S. spying a border, but stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, the proportion has gone too far."
The president is determined to create clarity, and that is why a thorough investigation so that no one must feel that there is abuse.
I can assure you that will not affect the rights of innocent people in this process.
Kerry, however, that the NSA was a force for good, and many lives have been saved by its monitoring operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up in the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is keen to kill people to blow up in the air and attack governments.
What would happen if we would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have indeed, plane crashes, prevent attacks on buildings and the killing of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, American legislators will travel to Europe to allay the concerns about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the anti-terror efforts with the United States, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is concerned about their threats not to participate because of frustration over the surveillance by the National Security Agency more anti-terror organizations.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism on board," said Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs and Foreign Relations, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in combating terror, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the secret service declared this week that the reports are unfounded and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and have been replaced with the United States.
Other disclosures cited documents passed from Snowden that the NSA had monitored the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
The director of national intelligence, James Clap, who defended the spying on allies is necessary and that this is common on both sides.
In all the uproar, Murphy said his agency is preparing the journey of the Congress, which is to take place this year, and hoped the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other MPs to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact itinerary will be worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip is to improve the relations, he said that it would give some "serious" words.
He said that European governments would have to be honest with their citizens about the kind of spying programs, which they had devoted themselves for years.
"Although we can change our surveillance programs and protect the rights of Europeans, but they must come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones to spy," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry over the weekend for a trip to the Middle East and to Poland to see the resentment of the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the U.S. surveillance activities.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott have interests conflict with parental leave
Who says billionaire Clive Palmer, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and members would be in a conflict of interest in his plans to leave because his daughters become pregnant and therefore might benefit from it.
The mining Magnat, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, saying that he wanted to wipe off the table questions whether he is in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision of whether to delete or reduce the carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that could only have ministerial conflicts of interest and would benefit the daughters of Abbott personally by the laws.
"He is a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not they will leave," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission declared Palmer by 53 votes after the recount, the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the process of counting to go faster.
Tony children; daughters Frances and Bridget.
These elections should be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we have a system in which hereinmarschiert, entering the data into a computer, and then immediately elects at 6:30 p.m. the result?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils for marking the ballots.
They are used, because they can wipe out the results if they do not like?
Nowadays must be coordinated with pencils.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he was "very serious" will take his new office.
In a public office is about the public service.
"We want no reward except the history, namely that we can serve at a critical time for this community," he said.

ESA decides on major space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, black holes, gravitational waves or experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have found.
If there is at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should one look for gravitational waves?
Or prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or discover earth-like planets and to search for alien life, perhaps?
These questions confront the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research.
The budget for such missions, "l" is about one billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
The elite met in Paris in early September, the European space research to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of them are now in the final round.
Many bodies on the proposals, tick with the researchers.
A final decision is expected to fall in the next few days by the scientific program committee.
A total of four big questions that Esa has selected the missions of the 2007 "program" cosmic vision "to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes for the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the formation of planets that orbit these stars still lie in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could pierce the darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise there?
To investigate this matter, "dynasty," launching the space telescope in 2017, will be investigated with the 500 known planetary systems in our vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, Khufu is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, the astronomers and even the composition of their atmospheres analysed organic-rich fine fraction of planets and to search for "biomarkers": Gases, which are seen as sign of biological activity.
How does the solar system?
Ultimately, this question is to give information about the conditions for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity plays an important role of a star and the interaction of their magnetic Felds, as well as its continued particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system to study these processes.
With the "Solar Orbiter" Esa already has a mission of the series (the budget is around half a billion euros) approved for this question.
The probe will start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun.
The researchers are also of great interest to Jupiter and its moons.
You want to find out what role played in the development of the giant planet of the solar system.
This is the kind of the first of the three L - the "cosmic vision" missions - programme.
The probe "juice" (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey in 2022.
ACHT years later they reached Jupiter and the planet's atmosphere and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede, Kalli Sto.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus whether the known laws of nature are still valid.
Maybe there are also variations that could point the way to a new theory, the physicists can come together under the umbrella of all known laws of nature.
As the universe was born, and what is it?
The Big Bang created our universe 13.7 billion years ago.
Besides the material from which stars, planets and creatures bombarded as we are, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, accelerated by the actions of the Universe.
The researchers do not yet know what physical laws were in the first seconds of the CMB, which are still dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" already approved by the Esa here a M- 2020 mission, scheduled to be launched.
With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, and thus allow conclusions on the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals at the end of the selection procedure will remain only two.
The best chances of approval as a mission, according to many experts, "Lisa," a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Including physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have been proven to date.
Elisa could succeed, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission is one of two or three probes existing detector that will be deployed in space.
He could prove that unlike plants on Earth and gravitational waves that have emerged during the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.
FOUR more proposals to compete for the second L mission: A large X-ray telescope called "Athena," is to explore the black holes, among other things, "icy planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," is to identify and investigate the organic-rich planets.
Among other proposals are already resigned to the samples - returning from Mars, Venus and the exploration of the moon, asteroids and solar physics.

CDC publicize allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) a series of guidelines for the treatment of children with food allergies in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government, because the number of school-age children with food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children, according to the CDC between 1997 and 2007 has increased by 18 percent.
The guidelines include information for faculty and staff at the schools to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools Epinephrin stock - the injection of the EpiPen brand is used most often - in order to face a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms, which are called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels as if something is on my tongue," "my mouth feels as if there is a hair," or "tickles my tongue."

Firefighters called to rescue a Huendchens, 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous cliff in a quarry was stranded
Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby was runaway after a minor traffic accident
THREE days later she was discovered by a dog in the quarry in their predicament
Firemen seilten on cliffs and saved the dog safe death
Firefighters managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stranded on a 15 metre high ledge in a rock wall.
The nine-month old Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby was runaway after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone, before it was rescued on Wednesday from a quarry.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, including the dog, came to the quarry Flap Pit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take Ruby to welcome and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been searching desperately for their missing dog and published calls in social networks when it was bolted to the traffic accident in the quarry.
At approximately 14:15 p.m. on Wednesday saw a walkers who executed his dog, Ruby's stranded on a 15 -metre-high (in the quarry.
The technical rescue team rushed to the site of the Cleckheaton Fire Station and seilte themselves to save Ruby's, which was then transported in a dog crate.
Andy Clayton, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the cliff - only 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
They did not muscle during their rescue - she was steifgefroren.
But now it is a good thing.
Then she has eaten a few dogs.
That was a pretty unusual.
The fact that the dog was found, is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist of technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a giant luck."
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet to investigate, but said nothing except fatigue and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was scary."
I could not believe that it was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor.
The veterinarian if they become too large and the exhaustion would have collapsed, they probably would have sunk.
The firemen have done a splendid job.
It was really brave what they have done.
We are just so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson added: "Most Influential People, we were afraid that she would fall, but they remained at the top."
The firemen were great.
I can hardly believe, where she was.

U.S. border: "Discovered" super tunnel for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators discovered a "super tunnel" and shut down illicit drug smuggling.
As reported by U.S. customs authorities, was more than 500 meters long tunnel between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system.
THREE suspects were arrested, eight tons of confiscated marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel was not yet in use, according to the data.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can appears under the radar," said the general prosecutor of the U.S. Southern California district, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it was discovered that one end of the tunnel.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy: "If you continue such a tunnel and tried to use them, we are determined to make a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
More than 77, 000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006 have been associated with drug crime.
From the experts
Because of the elaborate tunnel, the investigators assumed that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that construction took about a year.
Construction was so that could be used electrically powered cars.
On the Mexican side, the access in a building that is 80 meters away from the border.
According to authorities, a head 20 metres in depth to the tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
He also would have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the US.
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the confiscated marijuana.
All of them, as a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, it said at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that has been found in such a tunnel construction cocaine.

Obama's climb-down in health policy
After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After receiving hundreds of thousands of their insurers a letter of resignation, the president threw the Republicans in recent days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama watered down his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who receive such communications, to look for a new insurance on the open market.
Most citizens might be a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than received.
"You get a better offer," he said.
The government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have completed their own insurance, would have to look around for another collective contract, because it does not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell the Americans very directly: They deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform since October "abysmal."
"I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This is a disgruntled Sebelius to sit behind her advisers during yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a dispute with the Republican legislators Billy Long from Missouri. The concern was whether it should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Sebelius repeatedly with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act have not renounced voluntarily to a state-sponsored insurance to complete itself a tariff to HealthCare.gov, she now wants to sell millions of Americans.

Parents can choose from intersexuellen children "indeterminate gender."
Germany is the first European nation where a third sex is recognised for children who were not born with ambiguous genitalia.
No longer will newborns be rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents have to explain a sex can be more for these children, but "undetermined" or "no" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure off parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for a sex allocation for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersexuellen people.
A year later, according to the BBC, said: "I am neither man nor woman intersexuelle person."
I maintain the patchwork, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
An estimated one in 2,000 children every year, either as a boy or a girl.
They are among the Inter Sexu Ellen, a group that, among the diagnosis "sexual Differenzierungs disorder" (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was probably intersexuell.
Understanding the gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts recommend in the US, we should use the best available information on sex, if a provision is not possible to wait and not on the psychological and physical development of the child, before we go - if any - for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "blade for a good cause."
Intersexuelle children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require a surgical procedure, but for most children are not," he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait, like developing the identity.
The scientific data about how a child develops his gender identity, are not at all.
No one knows why it happens.
It is like the mystery of why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission from 2011 states intersexuelle people were indistinguishable from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not geschlechtsbezogen, but by their biological condition, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically not both at the same time, or when one of them.
These properties were in second-tier sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or in Chromosom structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced intersexuelle and transgender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and Vorurteils crime.
No boys have been consistent with the picture of a special camp.
Meanwhile, it is in Australia and Nepal for adults, male, female, or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australians (52) and Norrie May Welby - the world's first "recognized" largely unknown person after a court had granted lifelong retention of a "unspecified" sexual status.
Besides the German cards have in the future, and a third, to intersexuell, the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news story on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French parliamentarians have signed a petition to the strict Catholic country that the "gender theory" should be removed from school textbooks.
The U.S.-based site Catholic Online also spoke out against the German law, saying: "If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we distort two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn baby, they told of Maryland would be better if babies will be assigned a sex at birth.
"The parents" existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child, "she said of the parents.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female parts, were seen as Hermaphroditen, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine the sex as something that you could build and destroy.
But meanwhile, questioned the ethical bases of operation, as is now known, the complexity of gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child's upbringing with the sex assigned to them.
"In the mid-20th century called it" a psychiatric emergency, "said Drescher.
If such a child was born, then called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals, Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental initiatives - educate the parents as a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and consider whether such a person as male or female.
But in one under the title "John / Joan" case in 1966, his controversial theories.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a botched circumcision to neuter the child to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl.
"This case is presented as a successful example of a conversion, but not what it was," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
With 38 but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still physicians who would have encouraged this approach.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries came to the public, "not happy with the result."
Such as Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory" life as a man.
So his external body and the testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he was awarded female hormones.
"I knew that I am not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginoplasty.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was amiss, he demanded his medical files.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised am birth - and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD that his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After he learned the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and remove his breasts.
The operation is becoming barren.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project that intersexuelle people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar - Mattis, managing director of rights group based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "could" encourage places like Catalonia and stamped.
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not" assign, "she said.
We fear that favours interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not know yet how it will impact the law, so we can only speculate.
Tamar, Mattis said that her organization would support the Australian law, because "it allows adult recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she said.
The German law relates to the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to the little children should be forced to produce at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual Differenzierungs disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "and" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Andro resistance gene.
Because of the Rezeptor Defektes of target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
In 29 and today is married Katie; she works as a researcher in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
While it is barren, but hopes that adoption or a surrogate mother to get a child.
"The law gives parents, and they must not make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
They will be given the time to do various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they are "male" or "female" letter.
In this way, everything is fine - it attracts the child size and loves it.
It was a wonderful baby and the parents.
And we must not rush to make an operation, which is not irreversible.
"This includes the children in the decision and the fear is that parents, because they believe that they would not do the right thing," she explained.
The child ultimately decides on the sex, which is more suited to him - and that is wonderful.
This will allow children to make the decision themselves.

Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "the Old Man and the Sea," cut Horst Janson.
Janson is an old hand in his profession, the Performing Arts.
The old man, no one can fool the fish.
The two complement each other.
It almost feels that creases in the neck of the old man, saith the boy Manolo, see fishermen.
If he is tired of life on the chair, is bent on Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman, and a character role, the Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a wrestler, a courageous man who does not give up and eventually wins through his knowledge and also its will to fight against the fish.
Janson is in large part as a solo performer on stage.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience, so are his monologues never boring.
His efforts to pull the last fish to the surface of the water, are so real that viewers forget that there is a sea of blue lights only bottled water.
Acting director Jens Hassel man leaves the old man in the boat above the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he is the most active scene into the light: The hut of Santiago, the bar singer Marie Luise, who sings with her songs and her magnificent voice and life in Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm, and at the same time, guests of the bar.

Appetite for ice cream, which glows in the dark?
A British businessman has developed the first luminous ice in the dark with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis, the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous bounties.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on jellyfish and could convince Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein.
The consumption of ice cream responds with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and the lights.
Chris explained that ice lights respond to the heat in the mouth and so the more you lick, the brighter it is.
Charlie, founder of Lick Me I'm Delicious ice cream company, "says:" The product is incredible, but still at a very early phase of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds. "
In the ice cream protein reacted with the tongue with a neutral pH value.
If the mouth warmed up the protein, the pH and the ice.
We have tested it in recent months, and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market, because it has this wonderful luminous.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream that I have ever made, because of the jellyfish light fabric is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
His experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is not, in itself, impossible due to the refraction of light, which is caused by the crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are made by Chinese scientists.

Google, Samsung, sued Huawei for Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of Nortel's patents, boycotters on Thursday an avalanche of lawsuits over patent infringement against cell phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that the insolvency Versteigerung of Nortel was outbid by him.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel's patents, sued for $4.5 billion Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the Community acquis of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents if technology, put the search terms on the Internet in accordance with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which is the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, HTC and Huawei, Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, HTC and Huawei are cell phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which stands in sharp competition on the mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google announced an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and offered $4.4 billion.
After it was outbid on the Nortel - patents from Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the lawsuit patents at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues," according to the lawsuit.
Rockstar carries a high damages from Google, as it claimed that Google's patent infringement was intentional, according to the indictment.

Oil prices have continued to up to 96 USD per barrel
The price of oil has fallen even further on Friday after a report that has been overshadowed concerns about a high supply of energy-hungry China's manufacturing sector.
The Referenzrohoelsorte for deliveries in December had fallen in Europe in the late morning in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil prices have charged in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy on Wednesday declared that the U.S. supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer was increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were signs of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in Chinese manufacturing activity.
This points to a continued recovery of the Chinese economy, whose growth had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after it was reached in the previous quarter, the lowest level in two decades.
The kind of Brent crude oil, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by American refineries, fell to the ice Exchange in London at 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.

The throw-away society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood is good, but at some point home.
A: In the bellies of people on the passenger and back seat, the hunger.
Clearly, this may be one or more cocktail or champagne responsible!
What is more natural than to go to the next Drive-In chilled for a snack?
I admit that I am quite happy with it, if it is late or early in the morning to fast food.
A few chips, a Coke and a burger and depending upon home and plugs.
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco Gaeng designers.
What must be one that raises with constant regularity its fast-food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on the weekends are discarded paper bags around streets and parking lots.
"Why?," I ask.
The people are too stupid to make the bags to take home and until the next dustbin?
It is not only that the paper Zeugs disfigured the landscape.
Bags also have been triggered by accidents and traffic facilities, including barriers hidden.
So what does the "throwaway society" but not, presumably, they do not even know what that word means.
If you are travelling more often at night, particularly with several people in the car, you know, a back seat after all nights: Clothes, bottles and other garbage are piling up.
That would represent a few bags but also nothing more or less - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to rumtrampeln on swill.
I see the day when we will already come to the cities and communities need to demand the removal of dopey and fast-food chains for their bags.

A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box, which will take place in the dashboard of each car.
The devices, which record every kilometer and report the information to the authorities, are central to a controversial trial of Washington and the state was planning to revise the outdated system of financing American roads.
The normally rather dull road planning suddenly has sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups and called for the government of the small boxes to record mileage charges - and possibly, where they were taken and then the information can be used for the calculation of tax, oaths.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while no agreement can be reached on a course of action in Congress, several states do not wait any longer.
They are looking at how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile travelled.
Thousands of motorists have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance, already tested.
This really is a must for our country.
"It is not something that we will only use may be," said Hasan Ikhrata, director of the Southern California Assn. Of Governmental Movements, which has a record of a milestone for all California motorists in the state since 2025.
The way we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes, Americans pay at the pump is broke.
But in America is no longer as much petrol as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state-owned petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to high gasoline prices, raise the tax by a penny.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on commercial law at the University of Minnesota.
The federal government has recently provided 500 cars with black boxes, which are designed to test a meilenbasiertes payment system.
"This is the best option in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it meilenbasierte user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea of urban liberals, because, for example, the tax could be used to influence the behaviour to reduce congestion and greenhouse gases.
California's planners are counting on the system in the elaboration of strategies that are to be achieved, ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal government on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers are taken with the idea of the Reason Foundation, drivers pay according to a pre-arranged route.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers, who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move toward meilenbasierter reckoning.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would include 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives, the thrust and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles in everyday life on the way to work or in the city.
However, several states and cities move on their own in this direction.
The most active is Oregon, which enlists 5,000 drivers for the greatest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also is considering.
Illinois is testing it in a limited way with lorries.
And the I- 95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not an universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers have been recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical at the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the test started, warned the ACLU of Nevada on their website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in full-blown surveillance devices."
There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for more affordable technology that can capture the state mileage, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan, the public would be unlawful.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company is not originally taken to help states in the taxation of motorists.
Rather, it was their goal to be in an emerging market for car insurance, which involves paying drivers based on miles driven.
But the devices tested on the road planners are also interesting, because they do not use GPS and provide only limited information that will be uploaded regularly via modem.
"The people are more willing to participate, if not record their speed and locations," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs were made big mistakes.
There is much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with it to give drivers a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose equipment and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a skeptical public by providing the devices with more functions than smaller.
In New York City transit officials want to develop a device on taxation, will also pay the parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data are collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion.
"Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate," it said in a planning document.
But some transport planners wonder whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge red herring.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund through tax on fuel.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, are imposed, so that they pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if there is an aspirin," said Randy aero-engine, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things.

Bad Duerrheim: A dream comes true for the Champions League.
On the importance for the city and the football club was the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf pitch despite the cold weather and the rain, nothing.

It was the musicians who rounded up the ceremony, just as so many speakers.
Wet was also the chairman of the FC - who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.

Snowden was willing to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence agency, says that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag, if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander no answers about their activities.
The German deputy Hans-Christian Stroebele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum in order to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, who was presented on Friday they were unlucky with the media in Berlin, writes this: "Even if it was the result of my efforts, my government is trying to be positive, treated dissent as loyalty and to criminalize political speech with criminal threat, which is not a defense."
Telling the truth is not a crime.
Snowden writes in the letter that he was convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The U.S. Department of Justice's indictment includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk with German representatives, then we will find ways to make it."
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have been strained by allegations that the NSA had bugged the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MEP, who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if it were possible, "without endangering him and ruining relations with the United States."
Stroebele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Stroebele said that he could not return to Russia, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden if he leave the country.
If aussage Snowden in Germany, then he need an assurance that he was "sure" that the MEP.
Snowden said in his letter that he would face a "serious and continuous" tracking campaign that expelled him from his home.
But he was touched by the global response to "my act of political expression."
Senior politicians and citizens around the world - including in the United States - have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a service to the public.
In his letter to the German authorities makes Snowden an offer of cooperation, "if the difficulties have been solved around the humanitarian situation."

Security concerns in Mozambique grow amid clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of the founder and first president, Samora Machel of Mozambique to sing in a rare public demonstration calls for peace.
"We want peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director of an investment company.
Fear for the future of the country, their business attire for a T-shirt with the words "we demand security" traded in Portuguese, and on Thursday joined the crowd in Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
RENAMO was formerly a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by the white government of Rhodesia and later of the Apartheit government of South Africa in a bid to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that zurueckfalle the country back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could invest in the next few years to more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tension.
RENAMO claimed that the government was provoked by the recent clashes on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Rena Mos, would have attacked.
The escalated attacks on the former rebels, as government troops tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama and Renamo - bases attacked, leader of the group, said Rena, spokesman for the Financial Times.
The government has accused Renamo of blame for the clashes and the organization that attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Compared to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as "losers" who "wants to use all of its remaining forces to prove that the government can impose its decisions."
FRELIMO and Renamo both stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Maza Nga was quoted as saying that Renamo was the 1992 peace agreement.
To the FT he declared that he meant that FRELIMO does not respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," said Maza Nga.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"Here we have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who heads collide," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement, concessions and financial concessions from the government.
Rena's electoral success since 1992, while a newer party shrink from a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably will improve in the elections.
Maza Nga said that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency," said Maza Nga.
It is unclear what Renamo capacities, but she has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South ties.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira, but finds itself in the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, a month after the use of the railway after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Maza Nga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.
RENAMO wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Maza Nga.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, said Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent Entfuehrungs wave.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar sultans, a protester, said that people simply wanted stability.
FRELIMO and Renamo "no interest, they simply want to regain peace and usable roads," he said.

Chinese newspaper to call for "reform"
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded the release on the front page of a reporter who had been charged with defamation, should be reformed, told a press Regula.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou had printed a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen was later on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports on a teilstaatliche company.
The New Express will now undergo a "comprehensive Rektifizierung" the regulator said.
The "Rektifizierung arrangement" was issued by the agency for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yang Cheng Evening News Group, had published between September 2012 and August 2013 several inaccurate reports of the listed company Zoom Lion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized," announced the regulator in a statement.
She said, "we have decided to impose an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and his reporter license."
"We have also instructed the Yang Cheng Evening News Group, the New Express, recommended a complete Rektifizierung and to identify the relevant officials at the New Express and the management team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, where he reported on alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of building machinery called Zoom Lion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen on state television and admitted that he had published false reports in exchange for payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoom Lion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain the trust of the public," he declared to the state-run news channel CCTV.
I have done so primarily because I was at money and glory.
It has become clear to me that I have acted wrongly.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page, and that they had failed to check the reports.
Various known suspects have filed recently on television confessions.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a change in the law, which was banned earlier this year the authorities to force someone to blame themselves.

Children should be myths and legends as "role models for life," taught an author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force against clever tricks," has no chance to do that and the Arthurian legend, how important it is to have a dream.
But many of the myths are "far too wild to be offensive, and in some cases, to be taught in schools," which is why Cross Ley - Holland for a "careful selection" pleaded school-relevant works.
"I find it wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education," he said.
I have already proposed a plan for twenty years.
He added, with authors and teachers, the "overly didactic," children "would be completely shut down," because "subliminal" messages in entertaining stories would be conveyed.
Cross Ley - Holland, has translated the Beowulf, the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "We can pursue certain intentions, but we should keep them in the background as soon as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
This must be represented by the undercurrent of history not be revealed and explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of tell.

While Daley the investigations as "due diligence," said Martin to Anderson Cooper of CNN that had been used during the campaign for the re-election of considerable effort to find out whether such a move auszahle, on the ballot.
"In campaigns is not spent so much money on polling and focus groups, if you are not thinking seriously about something," Martin said on AC360.
It is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley, whether his former boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley has said he does not believe that the President was aware of the possible change ,"" the former chief of staff, it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "double Down" deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether we will have achieved the political soundings Obama's desk.

Municipal council welcomes sound budget
Whenever it comes to council meetings to the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster laugh.
The Gemeindesaeckl in Wangen - Schoenberg's stove is well stocked and debt does not know the administration since 2005.
For the financial year 2012 can be made in this sense as an unqualified success.
This was at the launch of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Roth, the administrative budget is planned with about 7.6 million more than a million higher than that.
The Ueberschuss of the administrative budget of around EUR 1.8 million is about one million euros over the approach.
It was the Ueberschuss especially higher business tax revenues and the county's share of the income tax.
The capital budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million last year, it was EUR 2.5 million.
"This is essentially due to the increase in supply from the administrative budget," says Roth.
As planned, made in 2012, has been less investment than the backward areas and higher.
Overall, the general reserve fund could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked the mouth and her team for their good work.
"This work cannot simply shaking out of the sleeve," Gerster praised overlooking the annual financial statements.
He and the local councils were visibly over the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could come at the public soon.
Through the good financial situation could forgo the community in the past to high rates.
But this, in turn, have been reduced several times, according to Gerster, grants from the country.
For these grants from various compensatory sticks, there are conditions.
Among other things, the cities and communities who apply for grants, with some rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, because investment in the coming years, for which we would like to support," announced Gerster, in this context.

Despair scream of an Obama voter
I have twice elected President Barack Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blockade tactics of the Republican
The blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is the second year student at the Harvard Medical School.
I read a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought it would be sad during the second year of medical studies to liven up and give me hope.
It is called "the Audacity to Win" (gaining courage) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama to the presidential election in 2008.
When I'm finished with my patients, "and go to bed, then the book leads me back to a time when politics could rob millions and inspired speeches.
The election was a landslide victory and kept the news to guide the historic importance of this hour.
My classmates and my parents wept with joy, all the newspapers that they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on his way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
As Obama moved to office back in 2008, he had approval rates of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if taken from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I made my voice for the first time, something has changed.
But there is simply nothing that I could imagine.
I acknowledge the great and varied things that Obama has reached, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for medical insurance until military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have tipped too many aspirations that our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after countless times I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances, brings me to my point to the end.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican blockade policy does not explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It does not explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers will be punished, the government misconduct.
It does not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why it bypassed public financing and spending limits during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House's efforts to restrain the media are the "most aggressive... Since the Nixon administration."
And, most recently, it could not excuse the inability in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act a simple website.
I do not know if this is what I should have expected.
If I should have understood in 18 that could contradict the government's work to their previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the parliamentarians, not a predictable rate, because of an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, then they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I have 2012 elected Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed to be able to determine its direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes that we had heard for so long.
But with the drop in approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with election officials after the decision, he said his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I hope that we will find our magic again," he said.
We must remember who we are.
There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
