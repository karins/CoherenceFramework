Anger because of the sentence to the organizers of the terrorist act in Bali
Survivors and relatives 202 dead as a result of the bomb blast in Bali in 2002 angrily reacted to the last sentence of the conspirators, who appeared before the court, and claimed that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run, as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in creating explosive devices used in the attack.
If he can be released within 15 years, will receive parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was convicted in the massacre as a result of an attack on two night club in the popular tourist district Kuta, during which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism related charges, including in a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded life imprisonment, although they would insist that the man nicknamed "podryvnikom" for his reputation of the wizard for making explosives, should be sentenced to death.
This decision has painful memories of the mother of Perth June Cortines, which lost its 39letnih dochereybliznetov Jane and Jenny in the attacks, effected Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Barely while stifling tears, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He should be judged before astral team," said Ms. Courtin AAP.
"I will not have to live every day knowing that I have more grandchildren and I don't see my daughters."
"Sari" club was destroyed, when massive explosive device was put in motion, implicit in a van parked outside, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was "Paddy" in a bar, where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack, with explosives, just 20 seconds before.
After that attack for a month he went into a coma and "died" three times, being connected to a life-support system.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, responsible for the bloody massacre," Samudra Amrozi Mukhlas and Imam, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
To save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.
Get 20 years after killed 202 people and wounded hundreds - it is not so much.
Patek is the last of the terrorist attack in Bali, tried in court.
He was hiding for nearly 10 years, but in the end was detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American troops killed former al-Qaida ringleader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
In the course of the trial, an FBI agent showed that intelligence data showed: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda terrorist groups.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Courtin.
Until recently he never regretted how much grief he caused to other people.
The sentence imposed on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist act, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"this year will be a lot of tears," said Ms. Courtin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.

The lawyer, who received the nickname bash and nicknamed "steep lawyer" among criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to monitor Scarborough, of which he was previously in court, associated with drugs.
The officers noticed, as 32-year-old Scarborough left three sachets with cocaine Lancashire county, while he was at the dinner at the home of a lawyer in the town of Blackburn lawyers association with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta" regularly used "class A drug, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
In the eight months from January to August 2011 he tried to illegally obtained information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were in this time under police surveillance as part of a large-scale investigation of the activities of a criminal organization sales of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 other people were later imprisoned after the police take during a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million as well as more than £200,000 in cash.
A Ditta transferred information criminals out of fear that his cocaine dependence will be solved.
Today in the Royal Court Liverpool Ditta, who works in the legal company Forbes Solicitors, which the club was covered by a shame after admitting his guilt in two cases deliberate obstruction of justice as a result of court trechnedellnogo Liverpool Court crown.
He admitted to possession of cocaine in one of the previous court sessions.
The exposure of a lawyer occurred after police, Scarborough, found that he regularly spoke with Ditta elegates activities on the phone since February 2011.
Two of the cases detective for suspects and discovered how he came to the club Ditta house and placed the drugs 60percent purity in black percate golf under garbage boxes of a lawyer.
Soon after the transfer of Scarborough repeatedly soid with Pitt, who was at the dinner at the football stadium Ewood Park team "Blackburn Rovers during yesterday's press conference."
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.

Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, a dealer said he spoke with the suspect, because that was his client, and insisted that their communication is the "secret law."

During questioning by police, he said, along with the workplace, he had and the home office, and customers came to his home in legal matters.
However, the court was known that after important arrests he called the largest participants drug trafficking, a number of which he previously represented in court, to tell that detectives know about them.
In the speech, Anne White said, "and if anyone knows that one should not violate the law, then it is a lawyer in criminal cases."
Mr. Ditta accused of abusing his position of counsel in criminal cases, since he joined in too close relations with certain customers.
Contact, about which we say, is not just narcotorgovet but narcotorgovet, supplying drugs his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations, of course, will prove to be right, because it was their lawyer.
But this is largely shifted the boundaries of normal relations lawyer and client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible, in order to allow the parties to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta not kept their profession, and sposored her.
He too gapá with certain customers, in particular, Scarborough, and allowed doubt in its non-interest.
Ditta not admitted guilt and said: "If I were corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and would like to pass on information Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it without delay."
But after the meeting a senior officer Lee Halstead from Lancashire police said: "Mr. Ditta turned from a lawyer in criminal cases in the criminal offender as soon as I started to buy drugs from representatives of organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main objectives of criminal gangs that accomplished it to extract valuable information about the police investigation.
The lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and instill public trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to put some close on his profession.
The investigation of the case of Mr. Datta led the division by Lancashire especially dangerous organized crime that has already achieved a sentence for him on three occasions storage of cocaine, and now the vosprepyatstvovaniu justice implementation, demonstrating our commitment to achieve a just punishment for the perpetrators.
Let the case will serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and attract to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after his confessions to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people who participated in the machinations, were sentenced to amount to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On its website Ditta organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says his dream job is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect companion for him for dinner - Mohammed Ali, and the motivation to work is inequality.

The producers of jet aircraft bind over seat width, when large orders is at stake
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers inflamed fierce debate about the width of seats tourist class on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a violent confrontation on Dubai aviation exhibition in this month.
The dispute moves around the width of seats, provided the economy class passengers on long-haul flights, whose interests are not always in the spotlight airlines, with the volume of space allocated to them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft, Airbus SAS offered and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of the industry standard, which included the seats at least 18 inches wide (46 cm) in salons economy, but its main American rival Boeing says it must deal with the airline.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in all sales of larger versions of its bimotor long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21 expected potentially record orders.
The rear of the plane - especially the arrangement, whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row - occupies a central place in the statements about the economic efficiency of new projects "miniaerobusov."
Boeing says its new 777 will accommodate 406 people, on the basis of seats in Economy Class of more than 17 inches in width placed to 10 in each row.
Airbus says that competing version of its 350 will be transported in online 350 people on seats 18 inches wide, located on nine in a row.
Aircraft manufacturing giants often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
But now Airbus appeals directly to the public before airshow in Dubai, where the 777, is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing a slide depicting three people in a restaurant financiers, pressed to each other, called "you would agree to this?"
"Boeing is offering long-haul flights on seats narrower than the regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
With the change in the diet, people are gaining weight, but aircraft equipment seat has not changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 shirocofuselagny asked the standards of modern long-distance travel, and international century the average weight of American men aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the Department of Health of the United States.
The average American male waist girth of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the health service in the United States.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waist girth of those who recently called "reactive audience," was already.
Airbus says that commissioned the study, testifying that extra inch in width seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, studies show that interior convenience depends not only on seat width.
"all really comes down to providing airlines choices and opportunities to do that, in their view, they have to do to be successful," said Boeing specialist on Kent Craver saloon.
They don't want us to decide for them, that they would bring a profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The issue is to increase space for passengers on the sides, but for suppliers, it is increasingly becoming a factor, which can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is the race for orders for planes, at least in the $700 billion for catalogs prices in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of US and European exports.
As Reuters agency reported in July for the first time, the location of seats is precisely what fuels rivalries in the battle between the latest state aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing say about 20percent increasing profitability at one place in their latest bimotor long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365mestnsm Boeing both.
Announced the characteristics of Boeing 777 are partly based on a comparison of 10set rows with the original 9mestnoy layout of 777 constructive solutions.
The win in the share price declines when compared with 10set layout used in real time.
"the reason that Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make your plane more competitive compared with our developments," said Kevin Keniston, head of the department of passenger comfort Airbus in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say salons with full 10set rows for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer dense to be made on seating arrangements, which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
"seat width of 18 inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is due to the threat from the 777s model," said an expert on the interior cabin Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing did not supply the chair, but offers a directory of suppliers, from which the airline can choose.
Travelling the world sellers jets even blocking a roulette wheel to check rival planning.
Commending comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense layout salon for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus 350 with 10set offers rows, but says she still does not sell it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications salons, offering a wider space aisle on some of their planes.
Without the support of the only other maker of large modern aircraft, as experts say, its call for a new industry standard hardly" will jump," but may divert attention from a wave of sales of the 777 model.

Concern about security in Mozambique, due to a conflict of influential people
Under sires on them from the top down the statue National Mahela presidentaosnovatela Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo, to chant slogans about the world on one of rare demonstrations here.
"We want the return of the world; we want stability," said Vanessa deSousa, executive director of the company's investment.
Fearing for the future of their country, she replaced the T-shirt business suit, decorated with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined on Thursday to a crowd in the capital's Independence Square.
Within two weeks were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo is one of the most violent clashes since a truce of more than 20 years ago.
Renamo once was known rebel movement, which was supported by Rhodesia's white authorities at first, and then the government of South Africa of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 truce, it has become an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again ECB to full-scale conflict, but recent events made me nervous foreign investors and local residents.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore reserves of natural gas and coal deposits in the northwest may attract more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling party Frelimo, the leading political force since 1975, and the party Renamo accuse each other of this tension.
The party Renamo argues that the government has become the latest clashes challenger, attacking its members in the province of other diseases, traditional an Renamo, on October 17.
The attack on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama - the leader of the group, told the Financial Times newspaper Fernando Mazanga, Renamo representative.
The government blames Renamo in initiating clashes, accusing the party in an attack on soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Guebuza AFP, the French news agency, said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt "a failure," zahotevshim to use "all that is left of his forces, to try to prove that he can impose their own government decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown after reports that Mazanga said Renamo refusal from the peace agreement of 1992.
He told the Financial Times that failure to comply with the agreement meant the party Frelimo.
"Our goal is to return to the talks, but very seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to help ease tension, which has a series of clashes this year.
"It's two influential person (Guebuza and Dhlakama), colliding fast," said Joseph Hanlon, the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to go to the necessary concessions.
Renamo party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections, scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure slabs movement as an attempt to win concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo declines since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique, or MDM, which is a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, who has to step down in the next year, when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want to multiparty democracy, he does not want to transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what possibilities Renamo, but she has already made rapid and devastating attacks on police stations and cars on a key motorway leading from the north to the south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of other diseases, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Bear - port, which mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal.
In June, Rio has suspended the use of tracks roughly a week after Renamo threatened an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was noncommittal when he asked the question of whether Renamo ends this threat.
The party Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not very good," said Mazanga.
Instability intensified discontent with the government, but many people also care about corruption, the slow pace of development and more recently, kidnappings, said Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media companies Mediacoop.
"People think that the government and the president, which bear the responsibility for the country's future and must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultan, a participant of the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
"no one cares neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want to resume the peace, they want free access to roads," he said.

The rules of the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia so far will remain in force
The Australian airline passengers should be and then turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite measures in the United States to mitigate the rules relating to these devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration of the United States has allowed U.S. carriers to change its procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing on the condition that they will remain in "Disabled flight."
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many annoying that they do not have access to its electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers view this decision potrebovavshee from U.S. airlines to spend a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change its procedures in the near future.
In the civil aviation safety also noted that they consider this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of flight still probably probably operate in Australia.
"civil aviation safety management currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," it said.
The issue is governed by rules that require companies to maintain security at any time, and from passengers - to comply with safety rules, of which they are members of the crew.
The company Virgin, which already discussed with the safety of civil aviation expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi on board, was not against change, but said that it will follow the instructions of the regulator.
"We would welcome the review by the Office of civil aviation safety questions about resolving the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now, when she (onboard wireless entertainment system) have on our aircraft," a spokesman said.
Qantas has said that it will adhere to rules operating at the moment.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and in the near future we don't plan to change it," she said.
The FAA is distributed to the American airline.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that would benefit passengers, and we, of course, we will carefully study the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
For US carriers influence decisions will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their park.
Carriers will have to prove that their planes are stable to radios from mobile devices, as well as to revise manuals, training materials, norms on piece of hand baggage and instructions for passengers.
"after the airline checks and confirm property of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, smartphones, and electronic books at any altitude," said FAA.
In rare cases, poor visibility, the crew will give instructions to passengers turn off their devices during the landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendations, heavier devices should be placed under seats or in the luggage compartments during takeoff and landing.

He said that the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: Hacking phones, surveillance and confrontation.

The bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is not "brotherly circle," to which groups in the United States ranked Leps
In the databases of Russian siloviki groups "brotherly circle," to which Washington canonized singer Grigori Leps, doesn't exist.
As noted "Interfax" in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after reports of introduction of the Ministry of Finance of the US Grigori Leps appeared in the media in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to Eurasian despite the syndicate "brotherly circle," were checked all databases, but such groups had been identified.
The spread of this information helps maintain the myth of so-called "Russian mafia," which allegedly acts abroad, believe in the law enforcement structures.
"even in the name of 'brotherly circle', there is a certain element of mystique, contains a hint on secret lodge.
"All this is very similar to piracy," the priest said.
The US Treasury announced on October 31 scene in your control lists on suspicion of belonging to Eurasian despite the syndicate "brotherly circle" Arthur Badalyan, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalko and Igor Shlykova.

Scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail of the dog is related to her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that pleased with dogs vilyat3 tail in the right side, from the point of view of the dog, while alarmed dogs pomahivat3 tail mainly in the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the canid family may notice these subtle differences in willing tail and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist from Trent University, said: "It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain differently are involved in shaping stimulators that cause positive or negative emotions."
We tried to look at this and that of other species.
He added that the same way in humans, dogs have the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to sophisticated piling tails other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of heart animals and analyzed their behavior.
Perhaps soon we understand why their tails sometimes are sent to one side, and sometimes - to another
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the video with dogs - dogs or naturalistic version, or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals have seen that in other respects nothing conveyed the dog was the tail to the right, from the point of view of the tail of the dog wiles), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail tended mostly left (again from the point of view of the tail of the dog wiles), their heartbeat ucate and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said he doesn't think that dogs is deliberately communicated with each other with the help of these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience, about what movements they should worry about, and what is not.
He notes: "If there is a few meetings with other dogs and often vile their tail in one direction is associated with a more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on that experience."
The researchers say that these results may give owners, veterinarians and dressers a deeper understanding of their animal emotions.
An expert in the field of the behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, invited researcher in Bristol University veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to test of whether the value for dogs have left and right hand.
Last year a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln's discovered that dogs turn your head to the left, to look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if look at devil dog.
And in another scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada he reported: "dogs often approached sobacerobotu, when its tail vile program to the left, and not to the right, instead become alarmed, is the opposite behavior in relation to the Italian study."
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in various research does not fully perceived animals in films or sobacrobotov as dogs.
Could be a useful study how dogs react to this dog, he explained.
"while on various mammals there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be specified, and dogs is no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which it can be registered their behavior, probably soon we understand why their tails sometimes are sent to one side, and sometimes - to another.

Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in the relationship with the EU.
To this end we have ordered the largest and most complete a survey of British leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business and the EU.
The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 of business leaders, representing a wide range of business in the UK in size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will surprise to many.
We found out that the vast majority of companies are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with particular attention to countries that hold the modernization and grow, while the EU countries to stagnate.
They want the government has given priority new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spent time on a long and difficult process of reforming EU institutions confusing.
When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to laws on products, the majority of business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned Westminster.
Attended the general discontent of the single market, with business representatives have stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits from being in Europe's trade zone," agreed with this even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European configured from all companies.
The last and most revealing - our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants the United Kingdom has pursued a course for a change of the treaty and on relations with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This result, which was observed among enterprises of all sizes and the largest (MFA), shows that business insists on a "significant change" that will return the powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high - the achievement of changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide 16percent shift in voting for it to stay in the EU.
The prime minister there should be no doubt: This poll shows that British business supports his plan renegotiation of Britain's membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects that the revision will result in a significant shift in the current balance of power back toward the UK.
The best conditions possible for British business and become all the more necessary as the eurozone is on a path toward closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority should get jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means the increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in regulatory activity of Brussels.

In Siberia should not be vegan: Greenhouse tomatoes do not replace spin
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, RIA Novosti correspondent vases.
People are forced from the products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
Here they don't move the winter without losses to health, and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate them, the respondents believe on the eve of the Day of vegans Novosibirsk dietitians and doctors.
Drink butter litres
Strict vegetarianism, when refuse to not only from meat and fish, but also from the milk, honey, eggs, becomes a way of life.
But vrachidietologi sure in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to strict standards in nutrition, such as a minimum, poles to health.
Complete rejection of animal products harmful.
In animal proteins are indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for the plant.
You need to be sure to include in the diet at least milk or eggs," Marina Bay is confident nutritionist.
She cites the example of fish, containing indispensable omega-3 fatty acid.
The richest them vegetable oil - linen.
"to consume it in the necessary for human numbers need litres to drink!" says nutritionist.
Doctors are confident that the people of Siberia pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
This season, especially vegetarianism is questioned.
In terms of our realities high demands for food.
To keep warm, need increased calorie.
"If people limit themselves to animal products, respectively, this calorie he dobs, an expert says.
Olga Poznyak vrachdietolog agrees with this.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruit is not a way out.
A man eating more predominantly products, which are grown in the region to stay or where he was born.
The genetic code is configured for the best utilization and digestible these products.
And in winter, people want not Once puppy, and hot spy postal or something else," explains his position the doctor.
According to her, from what may have vegans, truly useful various grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples, remaining in the winter, frozen berries.
But this, of course, is not enough for full power.
According to the vrachagastroenterologa Arifulina Claudia, Siberians in organisms have sufficient level of vitamins only since the middle of August to the middle of September.
Full transition to vegetarianism in our tough natural conditions, when temperatures can change for 24 hours to 30 degrees and snow in May, necelesoobrazen.
The body of the energy you need for life and, it is, first of all, the fat," concludes a medic.
Doctors say that vegan diets especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children are growing, they need a construction material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant women also need high content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
"Vegas nedopoluchaut them," Bogan is confident.
Arifulina says that an adult man is free to choose anything," to play in the toys, which wants to."
He has already formed the body, the skeleton, authorities.
And all the same children should eat efficiently.
If you deprive him of trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him that he will be there, it is a violation of the rights of the child.
"those or other substances for brain development, lack of vision, not vosstanovity2 bones of tomorrow," she said.
All the respondents specialistsmedici agree about low as winter crop in greenhouses and imported fruits and vegetables.
What to bring us and grown in greenhouses, contains fewer required us to trace elements than (grown up) in open ground.
"not the product quality," says Bogan.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruit is far from ideal standards.
Sometimes producers' desire to collect more harvest deals at the expense of quality.
"apples do not become brown quickly turn yellow and plesneveut is on the cut, cucumbers, tomatoes and aromatic bases" - cites examples of a medic, adding that they will most likely are excessive amounts of fertilizers.
And become suppliers not vitamins and fibre.
Don't agree with this zavlaboratoriey Siberian Technology Institute of agricultural problems, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach, and compliance with all rules and requirements in greenhouses can grow a vegetable.
If they try to remove them more with a square meter, then, of course, and to become more often, and perecarmlivaty plants mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large, but watery and slate," she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on conscience from the manufacturer.

Russia out of struggle for urban pollution cars
Attempts to solve transportation problems of major cities observed in most of the world's megacities starting from the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either about their rebuilding and expanding highways, or about trying to reduce demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
Widely known example of Singapore, where introduced strict quota increase the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them will be bought at auction.
Its price is two to three times higher than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the center of the city.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called green zone, where entry is allowed only cars with certain eclass that use the fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric cars).
Beijing's environmental protection agency, for example, approved in 2012 "clean air five-year plan" worth about 250 billion yuan (around $40 billion).
As director of the traffic pollution control department told Kommersant municipal environmental protection bureau of Beijing Li Kunsheng, the main goal of the Plan - the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, the growth in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as an increase in no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle.
According to the agency, motor vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% overall air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program - limiting the use of road transport, as well as the imposition of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city's "Green Plan" measures include accelerated transition to corporate fuel compared with the rest of the country, the introduction of the local system standards and marking cars and fuel, restricting entry of cars in the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (, moreover, the creation of a financial incentive programs to replace old vehicles to hybrid or electric cars, the development of the electric (including public and official), development of public transport, including high-speed).
Beijing Automotive Innovation is also a ban for all private vehicles to transport the movement within the fifth ring (only in the capital of China them six) one day a week (relevant information is contained in the number sign vehicle), as well as the issuance of registration marks for cars on a lottery basis, for example, in 2011, the first year the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).
According to the State Environmental Protection for 20122020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 them was 138).
According to the Environmental Ministry, in 2011 to "mobile sources" accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants in the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, the emissions from cars in ten times industrial, and in St. Petersburg - in nine times.
In the Russian Federation until just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport HSE policy Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for road trip, is patently unpopular, they can be taken by the company only provided their sheer versatility.
In the case of Moscow is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - business and personal cars, as well as cars "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200,000 (about 5% of the total number of Moscow's fleet).
The other day urbanists prepared the study of ECOM centre in St. Petersburg, where the balance of urban areas between residential buildings, with an area of pavement and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of researchers, the center of the city secured roads in two times less than required, and most motorists, who live in the center, not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time on parking or simply on the streets.
The result is invited to build the repository and not parking cars, not expand, and cut out of the snow, with a view to the streets became more friendly to pedestrians, as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the security zone of the historic centre (total territory about 3212 hectares, covering a number of central districts of the city.

The trip on dirt, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care

Belle and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country doctors not so much - just one in 5,000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes CNN 2013.
You can vote for him, or for any of the other 10 of the main characters, to become CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue its remarkable work.
Over the past 21 years Georges Bwelle saw his father returned to life and would once again in an unconscious state, wandering for hospitals, which were not properly equipped to help him.
Jammeh Belle was injured in a car crash in 1981, not far from Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.
At first he had just broken hand, but the infection has spread to the brain and caused hematoma, which reminded about himself to the end of his life.
There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, said Georges Bwelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken him from Cameroon.
Instead, Belle years accompanied his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment that they could get.
"It's not easy," said Belle.
"You can go out of the house at 5 a.m., pribate in hospital, to be the first, but you are not the first.
Patients are very much.
Some may die due to the fact that they have to wait.
The situation is not much has changed since then, as Belle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor for 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio is one doctor for 413 people in the United States.
And even if Cameron could go to the doctor, many of them it would be unaffordable.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of spending on health care in it are private.
"their only problem is poverty," said Belle.
"And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy your life."
Seeing the suffering of his father and a great many of his compatriots, Belle became determined to do something with this.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations.
He himself has become a doctor and vascular surgeon works in Yaounde Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008 he and his band of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 more people nabius in vans, privyazyvaty3 to roofs medical supplies and travel cross-country to visit villages in need of help.
Not always accompanies them luck.
More than once they had to push the car through the river and mud.
But when they come, they face, as the real heroes: This holiday with songs and dances and the best facilities, which can only offer local residents.
Free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration, and Belle with his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join fun.
The next morning, the brigade is beginning to take hundreds of patients.
"We accept 500 people on each trip," said Belle.
They come from all over the landscape within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, sexually transmitted infections.
Others may get scratches, donated points or free birth certificates - the documents necessary for the school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the brigade has a simple operation under local anesthesia.
The operation, as a rule, are held in the school building, the municipality or in the house; after the procedure patients stand up and go to the post-operative zone, to make room for the next person.
Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitary processing equipment, Belle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is unsustainable pace, but determination brigade usually help maintain village musicians.
"They all night beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work," said Belle.
On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of his work.
The group, consisting of doctors and foreign Cameron for medical students, spent 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their assistance could have huge implications for those they help.
One man explained that they received free surgery for hernia treatment will allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to this clinical methods on weekends and working in a hospital surgeon Belle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second work, he said, provides 60 percent of funding his nonprofit organizations; the remaining funds covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he sleeps," said Kathy On 'Melli, a student of the second course Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteer in the Belle group.
He has always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization, so that you can continue to these campaigns.
For the future of doctors and nurses, such as On 'Melli, coming from the United States and Europe, to join Belle in the implementation of its tasks is to practice, they would never have received at home.
"We got to these individuals on operations, where we helped to remove blood stains or keep Belle tools for doctors," said On 'Melli.
As studentomvtorocursnikom, you would never have received such a possibility in America.
American usually pay their fare themselves in Cameroon, often arriving with pogertvovanmi medication.
But on arrival in Yaounde them food, transport and education pays Belle.
"On 'Melli hero, without a doubt," he said.
He gives his life of this organization, and his desire to help people Cameroon indefinitely.
For Belle almost constant work load is not a severe test.
To help others to live a happy life, his father to fulfill this promise is what brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when doing this work," said Belle.
"And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I'm doing this, to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

For the "Russian mafia" in the United States finally has a new name - "brotherly circle."
This week the black list of the "Russian mafia" in America has been updated with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury has put in a "brotherly circle" three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis.
One of the Russians turned out to be a famous singer Gregory Leps, whom the United States suspect in transportation money for the members of the group.
In all the US black list of 22 people implicated in the "brotherly circle," and six organizations affiliated with it.
Yet many experts expressed doubt that this organization is really there.
"statement about the 'fraternal circle' more resembles the attempt to unite disparate criminal groups," said previously organized crime expert and professor at the University of New York's Mark galeotti.
In his opinion, "brotherly circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia."
"I haven't met anyone in Russian law enforcement bodies or elsewhere, who would have confirmed the existence of such criminal organizations," quotes Mr. galeotti American Center for Research of corruption and organized crime.
With Mr. galeotti agree and a professor at George Mason University Liz Shelley.
"If they work together, then it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," - leads her words Center for Research of corruption and organized crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark galeotti suggested that "brotherly circle" unites in large measure close Russian thief in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Santa Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
So, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zacharias Kalashov, extended the list in 2012, has been closely linked with Dad Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, accounted for Santa Hasan nephew.
Yet Mr. galeotti notes that some personality and have no relationship to Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them spent more general financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "brotherly circle" Grigori Leps - Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer - has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we hope that we will get more detailed information from our American collegpartnerov, in connection with what the decision was made, why it in such lists made, said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the head of state.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
The same as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.

Snowden may question in Russia
U.S. intelligence Ecssotrudnik Edward Snowden, most likely, will not to travel outside of Russia to testify in cases of proslushke telephone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions from members of the General Prosecutor's Office of Germany in writing or internally in Russia.
Edward's exit Snowden outside Russia is practically impossible.
In this case, he will lose the refugee status and can be issued by Washington countries - American allies," the priest said.
"at the same time, in principle, General Prosecutor's Office of Germany would be able to send their representatives in Russia or to pass written questions Snowden," the source said, adding that the issue should be in an advanced stage at the international level.
Previously a deputy German Bundestag HansKristian Strebel reported that Edward Snowden is ready to give testimony in the case of proslushke American special services negotiations Chancellor of Germany.
Snowden is ready to give testimony German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
CIA Ecssotrudnik made it clear that knows very much.
Despite the fact that the US NSA blocked all his movement, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But for this we need to determine all the conditions of his arrival," said Stroebele Euronews TV.
Lawyer Anatoly Kucherena Snowden, commenting on the statement by the Interfax source, said that his client is to cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will solve itself.
The US citizen Edward Snowden, worked at the CIA and the National Security Agency (NSA), fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which made public information about the secret operations of the intelligence services of the United States on surveillance on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was rescinded by the US authorities, in absentia predjyavivshie him serious charges, and remained in the transit area of Sheremetyevo Airport to early August.
The first of August Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo.

Children should learn myths and legends as "lifestyle model," says the author.
Stories about the Torah could show that "brute force cannot win a trick," and the Arthurian legend legend shows how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths are "too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools," CrossleyHolland stands for "a careful selection" suitable for his age texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America the myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I stood for the introduction of them in a training program for twenty years.
He added that "excessive moralism" authors and teachers" discouraging interest" in children, and the main ideas "sublime" in the fascinating history.
CrossleyHolland, which translated "Beowulf" with the Anglo-Saxon language, also wrote "Collection of Norwegian myths" for publishers Penguin and "British folk tales," said, "you have, of course, may be the intentions, but you better keep them with you."
Perhaps, a distinction between adult author, writers for adults, and adult children's writers, the author, is the need to feel some kind of hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to happy the end, but you need to have an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it should be sublime; disclosed through history, and not clearly formulated.
The old principle: To show, not tell.

Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
It is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and major layoffs.
Our main concern now is not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.
The last time he completely driven by consumption, which almost does not ease up speed," said chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens only, presenting a quarterly report of Investbank yesterday on the Russian economy.
Now nominal wage growth in Russia - about 10%.
With inflation at 6% he can ensure future consumer demand around the current level, expect at Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies falls, however, most likely, they will optimize staff costs.
Today we see significant growth of the share of wages in GDP: If wages are rising by 10%, that is only 2% of GDP, explained Mr. only.
Companies faced with declining profitability.
If she didn't grow up, this could lead to dismissals and a rise in unemployment.
Not to raise the salaries of Russian business cannot, said Vladimir Pantyushin chief economist at Barclays Capital in Russia and the CIS.
Unemployment near historic lows, competition for workers is high.
To attract employees from the side or keep current, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia poder of give and very rapid growth potrebcreditovania.
According to Mr. only because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplicative effect on the economy of the country does not have this kind of lending.
"good for the economy from potrebcreditovania growth, we have not seen any money not diverge on the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem in the other - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on unsecured credit.
Take them in the impoverished people who have nothing to offer in the provision.
Interest on such loans are high.
As a result, they often do not return," said Mr. only.
However the second threat to economic growth in Russia - a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured credit.
Director of HSE banking institution Vasily Solodkov now sees signs of growing banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, not having access to cheap resources, which have banks, were forced to raise funds for the population at a high interest rate.
In response banks took to the trail of war and began to cut lending rates," the economist continued.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same interest, otherwise they will be negative interest margin.
If banks does not waive dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, said Vasily Solodkov.
A holder of the licenses of some banks in recent weeks, an economist says harbinger of mass collapse.
"banks themselves don't cope with such a situation: A system of deposit insurance was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," warned the head of the Institute.
But consumption growth will slow and without the crisis of non-payments, believe in prestigious, civil servants and the military - because of the refusal of wage indexation, inherent in the current version of the draft budget.
Partly hit consumption will be softened freeze tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, the decline in inflation).
But only partly: If investments don't rise (as preconditions to that as long as there is no - see a certificate), consumption growth will slow, sure of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital until it sees the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still falling oil prices," he says.
In his estimation, Russia's economy will shrink at the price of oil below $90/bbl.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is still unable to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: Inflation has fallen, and banks began to raise the stakes.
This may mean that they do not believe the Central Bank, even the transition to targeting inflation," said Clemens only.
The Central Bank policy interest rates does not affect the market, affects only on interbank lending rates.
"it's the collapse of all hopes for the Central Bank," Clemens appreciated only one person.
The money generated by auctions of the Central Bank, banks are not lending to the economy and to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, immediately changing the exchange rate, this means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the ruble.
"sooner or later the Central Bank realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. only and recalled that the state take the ruble in "floating" plans by the end of 2015.
But will have to either do it before, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
In his estimation, the ruble exchange rate now artificially overvalued by 10%.
The ruble only one road is weakening," concludes the expert.
But if the Central Bank seront finalists a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to a weakening of the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much stronger.

Fau: "air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from a mobile phone."
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on a cell phone," according to the new guidelines, published on Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect that the changes would happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA, as their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update its manuals for flight crew members and the rules for the installation of devices, to comply with the new guidelines.
Fau said that it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines, which have already submitted plans.
"depending on the state of the plan we could approve expanding the use of electronic devices very soon," said FAA.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the plane door is closed.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet elevation and the captain does not provide "good."
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down for planting, and do not include them until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes properly protected from electronic interference, may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and steering, FAA said.
Most of the new jetliners and other planes, modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional cabin, welcomed the changes.
"after the new policy will be implemented safely (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier, to achieve this), it will be a win-win scenario," said Glading.
We frankly tired feel "dejure at school," when it comes to this issue.
But the connection to the Internet for surfing, email exchange of letters, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, according to the agency.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
Thus, still no "Words with friends" - intellectual gaming, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when the sensational case occurred: The actor was removed from the plane, the airline's American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the plane was at the gate.
A heavier devices, such as laptops, still need to be laid in the luggage department, because they can injure someone if will fly around the cabin.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory authority on phone calls are owned by the Federal Communications Commission, not FAA.
Fau may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month the National Council for Transport Safety, a national security expert Mark Rosenker transportation of CBS News, said that cell phones are still risk.
"cell phones - it really is the problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know, thanks to the FCC Rules that they can interfere with cell phone towers, when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
Industry advisory committee, the FAA to consider the matter, recommended last month that the government has allowed more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years growing pressure on FAA with the aim of easing restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as October from Missouri Claire McCaskill argue that there is no compelling reason for prohibitions related to security.
The restrictions also becomes more and more difficult to secure, as the use of the devices has become commonplace.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions off their devices.
Fau beginning to limit the use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of peach passengers for navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry radiopriemniki - high-tech gadgets at the time.
The new airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation aircraft, but they also are being developed and approved FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
The airline's offer to passengers using Wi-Fi at cruising altitude already within a few years.
The planes, modified for system, also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority ships fitted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, said Ward.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio much lower power than the previous generation of devices.
Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals when relisted pages.
But the signals are becoming more powerful, when devices download or send data.
Among those who pursued easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices passengers, was the company basis
In 2011, the company's representatives have downloaded an airliner with their own devices for reading electronic books the Kindle and flew on it, to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the Advisory Committee of FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices is a risk.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers said he believes interference from real devices, even if the risks are minimal.
The other members of the committee said that there is only one message pilots, confirming that the devices could interfere for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that FAA allowed pilots to require passengers to disable the device during landings on components in limited visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a lot of technological devices.
"We are pleased that FAA acknowledges that passenger comfort is not incompatible with security and protection," said Roger Dow, the director general of the Tourist Association of the United States.

Vilnius suspects to Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president

The new vaccine antinicotine can deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed antinicotine vaccine, which could deprive the process of cigarette smoking pleasure.
One dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before tests on humans, it will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the first results are encouraging.
"We hope that such a strategy of using a vaccine may, at last, to help millions of smokers who tried to quit, gave all methods available in the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern means," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was designed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies antinicotine.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker nicotine strike.
In tests vaccine mouse, which subsequently gave nicotine, continued their normal activities.
A mouse, which did not give the vaccine," "us," and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brain," the researchers said,.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to do so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into factories antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it would have been to give children, will appear before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.
But more likely it will be used smokers to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they do not get pleasure from that because nicotine vaccine, and it may help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but have warned that more research is needed.

The point is that the most loyal customers Frontier say they find a place in the top luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website, will have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the flight Frontier may get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
About 'Melli said that the change in procedures on the web site and at check-in desks Frontier is intended to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they get to the gate.
New Frontier for hand baggage fee will not apply until the summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but the airlines adore them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service, should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider adding luggage fees sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.
But most of them were not hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand baggage charge three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with this collection is a Hungarian Wizz Air, a consultant on airlines said Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks extra fees.
In his assessment in the report from December 2011, gathering for hand baggage Spirit brings $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew the Spirit flight, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, where passengers will face an unusual collection Spirit for hand baggage.
"the boarding process was the most smooth of those that I have seen in his career in airlines," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went rapidly."
Frontier also follows Spirit in respect of the $2 for coffee, tea, juice or Gaza.
Frontier said that passengers who receive gazing or juice, can leave yourself all the bank and that the coffee will be available for free.
She will still see distribute water.
Us Airways short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so in seven months, after passengers have started to complain and no other major airline did not follow its example.
The Frontier initiative to levy hand baggage fees when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline, is it the last measure to attract customers to its Web site.
The airlines pay onlinprodavtam tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
It gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to purchase tickets directly from them, rather than turn in tourist onlinagentstvo.
But Frontier went further all in this area.
In September she started to give bonus miles in two times less often flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through online travel agency.
On Wednesday she cut the number of miles to 25 percent from presale miles of travel.
So, the trip to 1,000 miles with Frontier, acquired the online travel agency, would get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the site Frontier.
The Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becomes unprofitable.
Revenue fell 9 percent, and flight opportunities have declined by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results, published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to rectify finance Frontier as part of the sale of the airline.

Putin has made impunity for his friend of Assad
And now is the news of the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we became known today, Israel struck the Russian production, which, according to reports, were intended to "Hezbollah missiles."
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production on November 1.
It was done in the framework of an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States chose not to conduct a military operation to which they're closely this summer.
Read more about the weapons and about what all this means for the Syrian president, tells our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said that Assad's regime will be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of U.S. bombing, and in the form of a deal, which a friend of Assad - Vladimir Putin.
Syria give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria has down fewer factory himorujiya.
More long-term and arduous task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand, this is about a thousand tons.
Previously, Washington said that Assad's days are numbered.
I believe that Assad must go.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when that happens.
He no longer legitimize and should leave.
But Assad remains.
And feels more confident.
His forces continue to use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents divided and poorly armed.
His people and leaving their homes, many go hungry.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad avoided punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors received the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made an impression of a man willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador in Syria had to answer tough questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother's hardly easier from what it was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad still holds.
And changes the weapons for power.

Intersexual parents of children can choose "uncertain floor."
Germany became the first European country that recognized the third floor in children born with the type of outdoor sex organs.
Newborn will no longer have to ascribe male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as "uncertain" or "unidentified" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who can take hasty decisions about operations by pre-empting sex newborn, and counter discrimination intersexual people.
One intersexual people, according to the BBC, said many years later: "I am not a man and not a woman."
I stay created doctors patchwork product with bruises and scars.
About one of two thousand children, EGRET annually, is neither a boy or a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis "disorders of sex development" is a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (nice or semis) or unusually razvivshimisya outdoor sex organs.
Wallis Simpson, may have been intersexual.
The gender identification is still poorly understood, but most experts in the US say that, if the floor cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it, than to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before the operation, if at all that happens.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, which specializes in issues of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but most of them children have not," he said.
You can assign to the floor without surgery and then see how a person develops.
The science of how a child will develop a gender identity, are not accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It is a mystery about why people are being homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersexual people as different from transgender or transgender, because their condition is relevant not to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not meet the floor is neither male nor female, and typically for both at the same time or not is not one of them.
These characteristics can manifest in secondary sexual signs, such as muscle mass, the distribution of the head, the chest and physique; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gives a general idea about discrimination facing intersexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes based on prejudice.
Boys with gender variations now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to be male, female or a "third gender" in its official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old resident of Australia Norris MayUelbi became the first person in the world that recognized "pole," octave in court the right to maintain "uncertain" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in German passports will be used in addition to M & F - X, i.e. intersexual third designation.
In neighboring France gender issues still cause controversy, according to a news release on the channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this "gender theory" pronounced Catholic countries have signed a petition for exemption from school textbooks.
American Catholic Online Web site also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity - no, we perevorachivaem another two pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Web site Baby Zone that she would prefer that the children installed floor at birth.
"raise a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child," she said the Web site for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sex organs, called hermaphrodites - on the beautiful Greek god, which had signs of both sexes.
And yet just ten years ago the medical community vosprinimalo gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then draw again.
But now many contest ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that the gender identity complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive assigned him to the floor when they grow up.
"in the middle of the 20th century, it was called "urgent mental case"," said Drescher.
When the children were born, you called not psychiatrist - you rang the surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to deal with children with similar genitals intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Mani from at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easy to change.
He has put into circulation the term "gender identity" and argued that the environment, including the social signals - the way parents raise the child, the child is interact with genes and hormones, determining whether a person considered himself a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as the "John/Joan," his theories were in question.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision, fully castrate child, also by removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but this was not the case," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But in 38 years he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors still "apply this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these operations for a sex change, said about himself," with the result."
This was the case and Jim Bruce, the writer's form from the state of Montana, who was born with male chromosomes A_____ B_____, but similar genitals intermediate type.
Doctors could not pinpoint whether he had a small penis or large clitoris, and were convinced that he will never be able to live a "normal life" men.
So soon after his birth in 1976 external genital organ and Bruce lyrics testicles surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl.
He began the female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew that I'm not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask questions.
He was appointed vaginoplasty in 18 years.
But while in depression and realizing that something is wrong, he required medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which did not give him the body to produce testosterone enough for the normal development of genital mutilation.
Having learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing his chest.
The operation made him infertile.
Today he serves in the defense of others in the organization under the name Interface Project, trying to lead a normal perception of people with intersexuality.
But Anne TemarMettis, executive director of the California Faculty Association Advocates for pub Choice, concerned that a German law "urges however shortcuts and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that a German law would encourage parents to make a hasty decision and to give the child "uncertain" floor," she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.
We believe that it is better to gain male or female sex, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen, as manifest themselves this law, so all we can do is to build the assumptions.
TemarMettis said her organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third floor."
"adult people should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexual identity," she said.
The German law implies its assignment at birth.
This is the battle, in which young children do not have to enter at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr Arlene Baratz mammologrentgenolog from Pittsburgh, which have a daughter in violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law "support" of both parents and children.
Bart daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development called "full nechuvstvitelnosti syndrome to androgens."
Because of its androgenic receptors work incorrectly, Cathy have developed female characteristics.
She has the vagina, but not of the uterus and ovaries.
Now, in 29 years, Kathy married and passes residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she was infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
The law gives parents the time not to take any hasty decisions for themselves," said Bart.
He gives them time to make any tests and understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female."
In this case you in order to raise a child, like a child.
You have a child, and you feel the joy.
We do not need hastily to do the operation, which is irreversible.
"This allows children to participate in the solution and eliminates the excitement that is driven by parents, because they do not feel that doing the right thing," she said.
In the end the child decides what floor he or she is more comfortable, and it's wonderful.
It gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.

The court suspended the execution of decisions on the practice of "ostanovityiobyscaty" in New York City Police Department
On Thursday the Federal District Court of Appeals suspended enforcement of court rulings requiring changes in the program "ostanovityiobyscaty" New York City Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
Second US District Court of Appeal said that the decisions of the judge Shira Scheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal lodged the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in how he performed a program on street detention and interrogation.
The city appealed on its decision and orders of corrective measures, including a requirement to appoint the controller to help police squad to change work practices and training program associated with it.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate of the parties on the request to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal said about the need for the withdrawal of US judges due to the fact that she had violated the code of judicial conduct and not poschitalasy with the need to avoid demonstrations bias, in part because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements that contain public response to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers have violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unjustifiably turning to black and Hispanic on the program "ostanovityiobyscaty."
It has appointed an external controller to oversee major changes, which include reforms in the field of policies, training and control, as well as decided to launch a pilot program on zakreplaemsh testing on the body of video cameras in police stations where there is most of the detentions.
New York came to the decision in August to stop the practice of storage of names and addresses of people, work on which was stopped after a police check.
Debate on the city's appeal should take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics "stopped and searched "criticized a number of lawyers on civil rights.
"Ostanovkaobysk" practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased dramatically when independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration, reaching an absolute record in 2011 in 684 330 people, most of them blacks and Latinos.
In 2004, four people, all - representatives of national minorities, a collective lawsuit filed in court.
Supporters of the changes in the program "ostanovityiobyscaty" in New York City Police Department say that these changes will end the unfair practice, form a more reliable and effective police service and may affect the way other police departments realize this practice.
Opponents argue that the changes reduce police morale, not the crime rate, would lead to unnecessary expenditure of money and will not solve a global problem of difficult conditions in police custody because of the reduction of the number of officers at several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of "ostanovityiobyscaty," which is in line with the constitution, but changes the way the New York police stops people.

Azarov promised Ukrainians crash commodity prices after signing the association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will be considerably lower after the country to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
He said during the chat with readers of his page on Facebook."
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a number of factors, including, inter alia, and customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force provisions on Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU fall significantly.
And that will mean that prices should be lowered.
"This regarding goods that come from the EU," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be as direct, it will be complex.
But, nevertheless, there should not be too price increase.
However the message on the billboards, which appeared in the last time quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is rising prices, it is not quite so, or if more accurate to say is all wrong," Azarov summed up.

A rescue package of $325 million for Tasmania's health
The federal government insists that the rescue package in the amount of $325 million for Tasmania's weakened health will be supplemented with tough conditions that guarantee that the state government spends money wasted.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to prevent the crisis caused by the aging of the population of the island state, higher levels of chronic disease and system constraints.
The decision was adopted on financing within four years after the government's consultation with independent deputy Tasmania's Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue package of measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems, standing in front of the state," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The size of the $325 million package includes $31 million at blitcampaniu on routine operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and operations on cataract removal, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for clinics taking patients without reservation, in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after flap, training of medical professionals, mental health services and systems implementation personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.
"These investments will go to the best doctors made the implementation of Tasmania's ideas on how best to help the health care system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The minister insisted that Tasmania's government will work in strict accountability and responsibility.
State will need to maintain current funding levels to receive funds of the Commonwealth, and monthly report about where he spends these additional funds.
The commission will be created from three people to make sure that the state provides services as efficiently as possible and dyne.
Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million doesn't solve anything," if not for them will be followed by a genuine reform, which would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for a response to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first turned to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the conclusion of the health care system this State out of critical condition," said Mr Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for the recent reduction.
But the federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement represents "a solution, similar leycoplasteru."
"the reason why we are here, is that the Labour government of the state had $430 million from the health system," he said broadcasters ABC TV.
When the government of lifting almost half a billion dollars, but Commonwealth invests 300 million, you cannot pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek guarantee that neither one dollar from the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.

A cry of despair voter Obama
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope to change
He says that Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism nullify laudable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as an excuse to problems with the site reformed Obama's health care system, the drone attacks
Memoirs of Obama's 2008 campaign are a sad reminder that could be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second course of the medical faculty at Harvard University.
I read terribly sad book in these days.
I thought that this book will inspire me in times of gloom in the second year of the medical faculty and restore a sense of hope in me.
It is called "the temerity to win," and it's memoirs about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
The evening when I finish writing reports on my patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people, and performances could capture the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historic moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents lacking all newspapers that they could only find.
The White House had come a young team strategists, and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's accession to the post in 2008, its level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
A return at present is a rude awakening, as vding of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
For years that have passed since then, as I lowered my first ballot, change is indeed occurred.
It was something that I could not even imagine.
I give Obama credit for its large and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on medical care available to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" rule, the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked attempts to move our country forward: Immigration reform, too much choice of public health and the closure of the base in Guantanamo among others.
But after countless number of times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I ended the explanation that I can provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism could not explain the resolution on the Departments of foreign leaders or strikes pilots on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data about the private lives of Americans or prosecution National Security Agency whistleblower, outlines the government's misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or failure to comply with public financing and spending limits during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, in which the White House said that pricladyvaemse efforts to silence the media, are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And the last time he cannot justify what you cannot develop a Web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on medical care available.
I don't know whether I do this was to be expected.
Whether I was at the age of 18 years to understand that the leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede him?
It is obvious that work for elective office is not predictable program of action, because our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and random events such as the carnage in Newtown.
Yet for all I have listed above examples we see that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a strange and brutal alternative, it seemed that he is not in a position to make a decision on its own policy or views.
I believed that Obama in his second term, freed from the pressure of future elections, meets, of which we have heard for so long.
However, when this week Obama's rating fell below 45%, to return in 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.
This makes me pine for many promises that letched.
This week I read that part of the book, in which describes how Clinton dealt Obama a resounding defeat in the primary election in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting to analyze the reasons for the setbacks he has told its employees that they should go back to normal and remain true to its purpose.
"I want to make sure that we returned to our appeal," he said.
"We should remember who we are."
It has been five years, Mr. President, and I agree with you completely.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely Nathaniel Morris.

Take an oath in Egypt's first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath, but his day celebrations is unlikely to be sad an end to political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" that brought an oath change, becoming the country's first freely elected president, Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black were in the court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during the ceremony, shown live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, 60th engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was banned organization, which target for tough action changed each other's governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarding the building, when Morsi arrived with a small procession shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the court building, to welcome the new president, and, in contrast to the days of Mubarak's presidential pump, the movement was stopped only for a short time, to miss its civilians at the normally busy road connecting the city center with southern suburbs.
Although Morsi ridiculed as "spare wheel" uncharismatic "Brothers," his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and panic speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists, but all those who want to bring to the business end of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak's authoritarian.
"Egypt today is civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said, dressed in a blue business suit with red tie, judges in the hall, where he took an oath obesity wooden panels.
Later Morsi headed Cairo University, where he was to speak in his inauguration speech.
He was the initial official reception with military orchestra, other state anthem, during which he stood at attention."
Attended a military figure the Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was greeted with the slogan "Army and the people are one hand" who chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s, has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising was born, zavershivshee Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and has promised to return the president's powers, which his office was deprived of the military council, who undertake the affairs of the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, not in front of the parliament, as it is accepted, he performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.

The exam will also be presented "unprogramme texts," to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined rate of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, pupils will be required to pass a graduation exam on language, with persistent recommendations of choice of English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education should tomorrow to release a new curriculum for English and math - the first subjects, discharged radical revision.
He will make changes to other major items in the next year.
Separately the regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL will present a revised structure graduating high school exams, with a new evaluation system and less exchange works.

Studies show that English schools paying less time math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week during the quarter), than in most countries.
By comparison, the Australian schools give 143 hours a year on average, and in Singapore students are engaged in about 138 hours.
Although the formal requirements will not be to spend more time in the schedule of math, coalition sources said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics, combined with increased factor in the ratings table, most likely will serve as an incentive to provide additional training schools on this subject.
The curriculum more attention will be given to "the tasks of real life," including financial mathematics.

Football is the reason for discord?
In the State Duma in the framework of the "open rostrum" politicians and experts were talking about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was and is: To ban football in the North Caucasus, because of this game - some scandals and discord.
The speaker Sergei Naryshkin reminded about recent events in Biryulevo and said that to reduce the "degree of tension in society" politicians and the media should be correct in statements.
Perhaps he was referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovski in one of the shows, which threatened to surround the Caucasus barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the birth rate...
All the speakers talked and on measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations between peoples, enjoying Russia that gave the debate somber.
Maxim Grigoriev said that events in Biryulevo - "model conflict, which could have been predicted," but "for these questions we have answers too many people and courts," and had seven babysitters child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time in terms of migrants practised Europe, according to obgestvennica failed, and we need to find their own way.
The historian Yuri Petrov pinned high hopes on the new unified history textbook.
"still need to create a manual on the history of the peoples of the country's culture, schoolchildren in Tatarstan to know that for people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov has proposed to impose criminal responsibility for "appeals to dismember Russia": "if in the United States said on the radio that Russia should be given to Alaska, then you'd be arrested and will give 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried "not good."
As usual, in everything he accused journalists that withdrawing sick and pressing national problems on public discussion: "in the heat of little debate whether what you can say."
"United Russia" faction leader Vladimir Vasiliev immediately advised reporters to sign a "charter" and agree to talk on the subject carefully, and then can take similar commitments and policy.
We have approved about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole is set, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he cited the law which imposes on regional and municipal authorities responsible for ethnic peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko delight over this law is not divided: There is not "a clear view of what is an adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
It means that the subjects will interpret differently the volume of these powers.
Municipalities have no personnel needed to address such complex issues, there is no money, and guidelines, which they could use, the center did not give them...
The head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities Gajimet Safaraliev offered to create a special agency with formidable called "the Ministry of National Security," which would have been national policy issues.
But Valery Artem Tishkov, which in the 1990s was led by the same agency, uprazdnennoe later, opposed.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level," the minister without portfolio," to which one might ask, if that.
"We walk on the edge, shells break next, is very important to representatives of different ethnic groups and religions together oppose provocations, and this work must receive adequate information support," said a representative of the ROC for relations with the society Vsevolod Chaplin.
No state neutrality in respect of dangerous ideologies, including religious be, in his opinion, shouldn't.
Then Oleg Nilov removed the debate in an unexpected direction: "more talented people than in Chechnya and Dagestan, another search is necessary, but pushing them is not on the way, not on the road," he said.
"not the way" - this is the development of football: "the footballer beat the crowds, the flags wiring, the comrades stones throw each other...
Maybe we do not need such a football?
There is another kind of sports - rugby is called...
"will not be equal to them in the world in this sport!" - hotly spravoross said.
No one will not be playing rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky intervened immediately.
You still curling them offer!
We need to know the national peculiarities, it's all the same that "Zaporozhets" Gruzin suggest..."
In Yaroslavl wild behavior in the stands made by representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football will have to ban all over the country...

The recognition of the National Security Agency reinforce paranoia corporations in terms of government surveillance
A warm afternoon in late August German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence service, his assignment was to photograph the roof of the building of the United States, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV had hoped to discover the assignment, and these actions entailed negotiations between the United States and Germany's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, US director of national intelligence, in September again assured that the United States does not use foreign intelligence opportunities" for theft of commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden - contract employees who became razoblacitelem - began to publish its treasury intelligence secrets of the United States, European governments and companies more leaders are not sure whether to believe the director on the word.
Reports that the US national security agency followed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored in the cloud provider's corporations, the United States, including Google and Yahoo, raised paranoia caused by observation of the state, to a new height.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone auditioned, perhaps, about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, that is, of course, are potential targets, and business leaders.
Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between intelligence services of the United States and companies.
I think, it is likely that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," says Oliver BITMi Green, president of the association, which represents small and medium-sized производство Germany.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to the study, published in July EY consulting agency.
In all, Mr. Snowden crest documents, however, so far there was no evidence that the US transmitted commercial secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain features in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that he should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen skeptical to this.
Someone in Germany's parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can just close your eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not an option," says its report Hasso Plattner, president of German business software SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European skill, would not allow her to die more than 20 years ago.
All subsidized in Germany: From coal to cars and farmers.
All, except for the IT industry.
And yet the coverage and technical development agencies in the United States, which have become known thanks to the revelation Snowden espionage were a shock for some companies that previously thought that the biggest risk surveillance is China.
A big shift happening in cloud technology, where the leaders of European companies better realized that data stored in the United States, are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to the survey, conducted the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-US players have abandoned plans to use the services of a cloud provider based in the United States after revelations of U.S. programs for mining Prism.
Jim Snabe, one of the SAP Executive Board, said: "We see that consumers ask a new question, which did not occur a year ago, namely: Where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they are physically will remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that the last message is only a confirmation of what they already knew: Powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and, therefore, these data should be protected at all costs.
What is going on economic espionage is of no surprise.
He has always had a place.
"It was the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate," says Kurt Bock, chief executive director of chemical company BASF.
Americans spying for us on the commercial and industrial level, and we also spin for them, because it is in our national interests - to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast of those retaliation, which they took as this may give an advantage to the enemy.
In large companies have long been learned the thought that I take free at the exhibition or leave your laptop unattended in the hotel room is, to say the least, thoughtless.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the car company Audi, says that for many years it is standard practice is to collect mobile phones before board meetings, so that they could not be used as bugs device.
The Federal Service for the protection of the German constitution recommends that managers of companies to consider the possibility of using simple pre-paid mobile phones during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are discarded.
Yet there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to [and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in their particular niche in the world market.
"small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV report warns.
The United States warn their own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
A summary of the US National Intelligence in February put France, along with Russia and Israel in the second series of violators who are engaged in antihacking for economic intelligence, after China, The Washington Post said.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage," the French worst of all."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French agency DCRI domestic intelligence, reportedly said in an interview in this month: "service well know that all countries, even when they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism, spying for its allies."

The Kenyan press indignant provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there is reason to question: What can prevent the destruction of the Parliament of independence of the judicial system in the future?," the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group is the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected in Kenya's independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new judicial body to the media "will always be biased because he is a continuation of the government," and content and advertising restrictions harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and bring him back to the deputies," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government "to take the media dead grip," and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya" received a serious blow," and attacked the bill as "draconian."
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attacks Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media have aroused the wrath of the authorities, recording translating surveillance cameras, where troops, which were sent to the place of attack, allegedly rob expensive shopping centre.
The police chief David Kimaiyo reaction has become a challenge to two journalists and media officials for interrogation, though the challenge was cancelled after mass protests by the media.
The new law on publishing houses worth up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists - can be fined up to one million with additional risk to be "excluded from the lists," that is to get the ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of malefactor, if the fine will not be paid.
According to the Daily Nation," even one fine enough to paralyze the work of the majority has been stopped."
She also said that these measures can have devastating effects on so-called "lively the blogosphere" of Kenya.
Politicians understand that, forcing the media silence, they can do whatever they please, with impunity.
"No one will never know," wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"provided themselves politics overwhelm the country and get us to hunt and collect," he wrote.
The Kenyan legislators were the target of public anger and in the past.
In May they voted for the abolition of cuts, appointed by the National Commission on salaries, and restoring the size of their huge salaries of about 532 thousand shillings a month, not increase taxes, is one of the highest in the world.

After accusations durgs Eugenia Vasilieva spoke
Eugenia Vasilieva, almost a year chained to the person the media attention, so far has never commented numerous publications in the press as the embezzlement in the Defense Ministry, and about her personally - relations with former Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and a direct result to valuable things.
But on November 1 figurant Oboronservis case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev said: "initially, of course, the task was exactly one: Pull out of me any negative information about the former Minister of Defense."
Was blackmail on the subject of what I have to give testimony, otherwise I goes to jail.
To date, these threats have stopped.
Then we go to court, we will prove his innocence.
In victory, we are sure to 100 percent.
With the conclusion that can be drawn from interviews, perhaps, the most Vasilev hit the words about the fact that she has no matter with taste.
Probably, meaning the official representative of the RF Vladimir Markin statement that the collection of paintings, which collected "Oboronservis," figurant affairs were fake.
Among the detainee property is a series of paintings that the hostess, confident of their deep poses art, acquired as masterpieces of world art.
But arts expertise, appointed after the arrest of these paintings, investigators found that they do not have any artistic value and, simply put, are cheap counterfeits," said Markin in early October.
Any paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence.
Then finally admitted that they are not stolen from the Defense Ministry, said that I had bad with taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss any personal moments?
In my opinion, this is just an outrage," says Vasiliev.
Asked whether she admits his guilt at least in one of 12 accountable to her criminal episodes, Vasiliev said: "of course not.
Admit nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no damage of the Russian Federation, we're talking about.
Simply enter deceive the people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's announcement of the Russian Federation that Vasilieva shirk figurant study materials of the criminal case, the lawyer said that he and his client "does not allow the investigator get acquainted with the case materials."
What caused the revelation is under house arrest Vasilieva, still not obassia with the press?
Perhaps as a woman she could not do not respond to the accusation in bad taste?
Or is the rights of journalists "Komsomolski," claimed a couple of days ago that she "fell in even greater trance under house arrest" because of the news about Anatoly Serdyukov reconciliation with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
"KP" Victor Barnet known military observer in his article "Serdyukov has returned to his wife?" wrote: "investigators did not rule out that after such a shock it may become more talkative during questioning."
Earlier Vasiliev some charges in the illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense took on itself.

The British government announced a study aimed at increasing economic benefits for Scotland from the 2 rail project.
The 2 project involves opening of high-speed communications with Scotland and the north of England, with the beginning of the First Phase in 81 year
The transport minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project "will bring together Britain."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was "delighted" by the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
First Step will be in the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and Westmidlands.
When the Second Step will be completed, the line will be built in Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised estimated the cost of the construction of a high-speed line between London and the north of England with £7 to £42.6 billion
The British government, which leads talks with Transport Scotland, appointed 2 Ltd to consider further improve throughput railways and reducing the length of trips for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to overcome the way from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal on 2 is to create a truly national network, which will make the UK and its cities closer to each other."
We develop 2 because of the benefits it would bring huge.
Without him we have to deal with the crisis in our rail network bandwidth.
But it also comes to transport links cities with each other; 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive the best message to 2.
Scottish Secretary of State counter- Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government's Keith Brown urged Mr Carmichael "unequivocally" to support the inclusion of Scotland in the 2 network.
Mr Brown said: "high-speed railway has all chances to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds economic weight of Scotland in the common arguments for high-speed railroad across the UK."
So we are pleased to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and the continuation of the railway line to Glasgow, Edinburgh, which already is planning the Scottish government.
I look forward to review the results of research with British ministers in the next year and a joint decision on the next steps.

Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: Turn creates the Russian side, which warned in advance about innovations.
From October 28 of the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures guaranteeing delivery of cargo, said deputy head of Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model is used in countries that have joined the convention on international traffic.
The checkpoints are working in enhanced mode.
"FACTOR" correspondent visited on the border and popal with long-haul truckers, appeared a hostage situation.
Prices in a milestone magazinchikecafe at a checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are growing with each passing day, as well as the queue of lorries.
The trucks are in several rows, stretched for about two kilometers.
The customs terminal Novoazovsk - VeseloVoznesenka provides one of the most important transport directions from the south of Ukraine on international motorway.
From here, the goods are sent in Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight even allowed inside, and after introduced these rules," Alexey Golovnev (photo) trucker complains, which takes transit through Russia cargo from Turkey in Kazakhstan and nearly a week nocevaty3 in his car.
According to new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and the payment of insurance of cargo.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance at which it patrols.
The minimum insurance - 4.5 to 5 thousand rubles (about 1,100 to 1,300 UAH).
Those travelling near (say, in Georgia, Armenia) with cargo worth up to $50,000, pay about 15 thousand rubles (UAH 3800) and cars.
While the rest are stuck - because no one so much money with them not!
Imagine, if the driver takes the cargo worth thousands of dollars, but all the way to Moscow, he need only four (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) 90 thousand rubles to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival on the border - no, - complain time, street is near their machines.
In the border stores and cafes and so always expensive, but prices such as here, we were nowhere!
The sellers were quickly and their vzvintili: 15 hryvnas cost pressures, seven hryvnias - coffee cup, 25 UAH - a plate soup.

NSA blames "internal error" and not hackers in termination of the work site
Wrapped in a mystery the National Security Agency said on Friday evening that shut down their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as stated in the network.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the intelligence agency said in an email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that probe in work was caused by a distributed attack such as "a denial of service" [DDoS] is wrong.
Earlier tonight onlines monitoring servers registered that the NSA did not work at least six hours, and the website is still inaccessible for some users.
Earlier the NSA representative told ABC News that inside the agency's secret network "by no means" had been compromised.
No secrecy information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one onlingruppa hackerovactivistov stated that it is responsible for the failure of the NSA site by using their normal daily rations.
Their normal daily rations are designed to explode the target site traffic, until the servers are overwhelmed and the site is not out of order.
Hackers relatively simple tactics, but the attacks are not intended to penetrate into the Internal network target system.
Earlier supersecret NSA, once received the nickname "No Cracow Agency," it turned out in recent months at the center of public attention and fierce criticism after the charade revelations about her extensive surveillance programs within the country and abroad - all this reaction to secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published frustrated former NSA employee Edward Snowden.

Gazprom chief Alexei Miller said the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, Gazprom's chief said.
"Today was a landmark event: The construction of the gas pipeline "South Stream," Bulgarian began the large-scale and important project in Europe," Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the European continent.

The agency Rosbalt deprived the status of the media for verbal abuse
31 October Armenia decided to recognize the invalid license for registration agency Rosbalt, writes "Tape."
The detention of the status of the media insisted Roskomnadzor - for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
In the course of the process was created an unpleasant precedent: The court considered possible to close the media, effectively denying the right to nominate counter-arguments edition.
What is Los Angeles Times
JSC "Information Agency Mikhail" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency has opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional offices.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former Soviet Union.
Since 2001 Rosbalt developed and functioned as Federal Information Agency.
By the middle of this decade the agency included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.
The Los Angeles Times has always held a very specific niche: The exclusive publications of the agency were (and are still) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement bodies.
Talk of the next edition to power structures continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that Los Angeles Times had an extensive database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions and what Natalia Chaplin stood at the head of the project - the wife of Victor Cherkesov said.
At the same time Chaplin role in "Rosbalt" guide to the end is not clear: Most often called her "the head of the project."
The director general of the agency is Larisa Afonin, chief editor - Nikolai Ulyanov.
A recent Los Angeles Times not figured in the ratings of the federal media - neither the quote, nor the audience.
In October, the agency took 25th place in the ranking Russian media sites attendance at random clicks version.
According to the same random clicks, the average audience Rosbalt.ru site is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials for the past five months - notes about the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of a group of "The King and the clown," pogroms in the Moscow Biryulevo soloist.
"Rosbalt" conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when to take effect the amendment to the law on the media, journalists precise foul language.
The Office discovered forbidden vocabulary in two published on the agency's website video ("however paradox of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot oskvernity oil rigs ").
The further describe in different ways.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of the discovered video accused Los Angeles Times in gross and systematic violations of the law on the media and appealed to the court to deprive the agency's license.
In "Rosbalt" have stated that claims of unlawful departments: First, rollers were not editorial materials, second, foul words in them were masked, and third, immediately after warning videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agencies investigating claims promptly in the world court - and when October 22, 2013 Armenia has accepted the lawsuit promptly, consideration of these complaints was still raging.
But already 25 of the world judge decided not in favor of "Rosbalt": Chief editor Nicholas Ulyanov was convicted in violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 rubles - to 10 thousand for each commercial.
Obviously, this and the outcome of the hearing in Khodorkovsy predreshilo - if to abandon the idea that the outcome could be decided even earlier.
On October 31, the court took the decision to recognize a certificate of registration" Rosbalt invalid," actually depriving the agency of the media.
That is not to say that Los Angeles Times in the course of this conflict remained alone.
The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (statement in the name of the head of Roscomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 signed 26 seats; the document was filed on the initiative of the Communist Party.
About that closing the publication said the head of the Russian Union of Journalists Vsevolod Bogdanov, Pavel Gusev, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, and the head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, leadership promptly even gave him any guarantees that it will not to withdraw the license.
The trial of the "Rosbalt" showed: Under whose jurisdiction safer being a means of mass media in Russia today is the big question.

Gene speech was education stimulant synapses
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and medical school MountSinai discovered a protein, thanks to which "speech gene" 2 carries out its function, encouraging the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study published in Science, you can read his brief content on the website of the journal.
2 gene is the first known genome, the function of which is directly related to the speech.
In his role was in 2001 due to the discovery of the family of a man who could not pronounce the words correctly and sometimes even themselves do not understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members had disrupted gene 2, but how it performs its function, was not known.
In the new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions 2 performs as education stimulator new synapses in the area of the brain associated with the formation of speech.
He carries out this thanks to another gene, 2.
The last was discovered as a result of the search for the factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
2 turned out to be one of 10 such genes, the authors found, while only on his activity set 2.
What 2 really affects vocalization, scientists confirmed in the experiment on masts.
When animals gene activity was artificially lowered, they have less shouted in the division with his mother.
If the activity of a gene rebuilt, recovering and frequency Insecurity sounds.
Earlier on mice also was shown the connection with vocalization 2 himself.
The animals, which injected human a copy of the gene, pirate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of the 2 and, accordingly, run by them 2 with purely mechanical properties of education sounds or more subtle processes.

You want to glowing in the dark ice cream?
British entrepreneur has created the world's first glowing in the dark ice cream by jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties marine animal, to develop a glowing food.
He came to this idea, after reading an article about Medusa, scientific and convinced scientists in China chemically to recreate glowing protein.
Ice cream comes into the reaction from the language of one who eats it, raising the pH level in the egg white and causing it to glow.
Chris says that because ice cream begins to glow when reacts to the warmth of the mouth, it means that the more you list, the more it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the company for the production of ice cream" line me, I delicious," says: "It is an incredible thing, but still at the initial stage, speaking about the production, however, for £200 you get about 2 grams of the substance."
Protein, which we use in frozen, comes in response to your language in a neutral pH.
However, when your mouth warm protein, this will increase the pH level and ice cream will glow.
We tested it in the past few months, and it seemed that it would present it in Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This, perhaps, is the most expensive ice cream from those that I did, because jellyfish luminescence in four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball cost me about £140.
But it is quite pleasant to taste.
Pilot Charlie Company, located in Bristol, famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and taste mosaic gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said: "I very much want to develop the invisible ice cream."
This is by definition is impossible because of the refraction, called ice crystals, of which is ice cream, but I think that we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent jellyfish, Chinese scientists synthesised properties

The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in case of Russia's economic pressure
The European Union have backed a plan to ensure Ukraine's gas supplies, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia will take any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
With the IMF negotiations on stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is the conclusion of an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF Ukraine can get 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters, doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing differences on the conditions of funding.
Do not believe in the possibility of the reforms that are necessary to get help, and international rating agency S & P posite on Friday Ukraine's sovereign rating by one notch to "B-minus" with "B."
EU officials, however, say that the IMF may show flexibility in lending conditions, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
But the country's financial support from the EU plan is a backup option for Ukraine's gas, the vast majority of which now comes from Russia.
Perhaps it will be natural gas from the North Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is as possible and reasonable way in case Russia "isolating" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this way of rapid reverse supplies to Ukraine can be used only in a few weeks, and probably will reduce supplies in other regions.
"between the countries of the EU and the Ukrainians are held talks on how to create favorable conditions that Ukraine could import gas from other sources and not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added the source of Reuters.

As bad things not deluge since the second world war.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents aged between 15 and 24 years have no employment.
In view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem - early retirement of older workers.
Such experiments already holds the largest energy company in the country, and the adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide part of early retirement for workers with the experience.
On the other hand, however, Italy faces a problem common for Europe's aging population.
And economists are not sure that the with premature rotation frames vindicate themselves.

Syria has destroyed equipment for himorujiya
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capacity, acknowledged the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament Damascus has finished the day before the deadline.
To November 1 Syria was to destroy hazardous production and other auxiliary facilities designed for combat training to use, reports the BBC.
The destruction of the stocks themselves toxic agents or their chemical components should be completed by the middle of 2014.
According to a representative of the OPCW, currently toxic substances are in pectate storage facilities.
International inspectors have gone to Syria after on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people were killed in the course of a chemical attack.
The main task of inspectors was not to lose time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more himorujiya - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipment ammunition.
For these production facilities will now watch carefully to prevent their repairs.
The next milestone - the middle of November: By this time the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan of destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
The issues here a lot.
Where they will be unitiated?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked Western razvedslujbami.
They readily advised the inspectors new objects to check if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus was not fully candid.
The United States believe that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The international community demanded from the Syrian leadership is in accordance with the agreement, reached under the mediation of Russia, is to destroy or bring in outside the state of all capacity for the production of shells, toxic gases and liquids and for filling shells these substances.
Now that this phase is completed, the next step should be the elimination of already existing in the Syrian army himorujiya.
It is expected that this arsenal may be has more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances, cojnonaryvnogo mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozens of different places.
To destroy it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to start agreed on a schedule of action - on this for two weeks.
The head of field operations OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally watched the destruction of equipment."
"They now do not have the ability to conduct further production or mixing chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement said that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and sure that factories for the production of shells and poisonous substances either destroyed or are ruined.
The remaining two object is too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, says the document, but the equipment was transported from there and checked by the OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of infrastructure for producing himorujiya was "particularly difficult," because the work had in the face of the ongoing conflict.
In early October OPCW has received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, time to celebrate that inspectors have not yet been found - they were too busy with work.

George Kerevan: The gap with Europe gives it a choice
Another day, another strashilka on independence.
This time we warn that an independent Scotland would have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
Performers turn stories about Service passport control and the border with barbed wire along the shaft Adriana.
True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits from more free movements in the rest of Europe, though - that predictably - it's not appeared in headlines.
Nobody also pointed out that the EU's members spend a lot of time to turn its formal rules as it suits them.
Because Scotland now is not included in the Schengen area, continued non-compliance requirements will be cheap concession to Brussels in return what he really wanted from Scots.
So this is not a credible story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: For the first time I heard "duck" about what "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting moment, lost to paraphrase the old tales.
Why should an independent Scotland at all to execute commands in Europe?
Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's a real European news: The great postwar plan to unite Europe finally has stalled.
With the project "Europe" eurocrisis officially dead.
Across the European Union Party, opposed the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany "Alternative for Germany" - eurosceptic party founded only this year - appeared from nowhere and received nearly five million votes in last September's federal elections, thus essentially replacing "the Free Democrats" (analogue our "liberal Democrats") of Bundestag.
Always there was internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the fetters imposed on the national economy through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to the idea that the project "Europe" has gone too far.
The euro crisis little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits, - it was only fair for Greece.
In fact Eurosystem blocked their members on exchange rates, favorable for German exporters, is that German politicians and want to save.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency southern Europe is at a disadvantage to manufacturing capabilities in comparison with Germany.
The only saving means - to cut wages and government spending that is actively supported Berlin.
For the current budget problems and a currency worth a deeper problem, Europe's productive capacity.
As a result of the complex of measures to "green" energy, embedded Brussels, a cipher, meaning subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, is the European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
This paralyze adverse price terms, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
No freezing salaries in the world will not be deterred crushing victory cheap US shale gas over European petrochemical industry.
As a result of incorporation of the revolt, especially in France, once the probably stone EU.
After the war the French political elite regarded the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer needs in Paris as a tool of political legitimacy, and Europe has already imposed its own economic policy, leaving destroyed France's economy in a mess.
The result is right, acting against the EU's Marine Le Pen of the National Front party just won the decisive extra election, violently the ruling Socialist Party in third place.
"front" is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning British Labour about the fact that you cannot proceed from the assumption that the split among the right will automatically be dropped in favor of the left.
What makes Le Pen with his newly inherited popularity among French white working class?
She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year, in order to create the bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If - and this is very likely - are configured against the EU's party will get support in this election, the bloc will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European Parliament.
Here's my opinion: The growing sentiment against the EU and against a single currency in Europe soon merge together, to destroy the euro.
The EU will not go away, but he will again become something like blurred "European sovereign nations," which enjoyed of General de Gaulle.
Germany and several economies dependent on it can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I guess the United Kingdom reproduction of this project, hoping to move closer to the United States.
Yet the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific points to the likelihood that the United Kingdom will remain unaddressed in the cold Atlantic.
In what position this leaves Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (essentially) Minor England.
Or we can to protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send in Berlin and Brussels a handbasket.
I suspect that Scotland can succeed in the framework of a free European agreement provided that we keep its currency.
Cooperation with other stranamiedinomyshlennikami will be easier in federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence.
The Scottish Nationalist Party government in Scotland is - ironically - the most successful political movement in Europe aimed against austerity, received a majority of votes in 2011 due to objections against spending cuts proposed (and sold) Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Aleister Darling and effective later coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be absurd to vote for independence only to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.

Early puberty: Aging before
African and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white likely, studies show.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals to blame
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity may be one of the starting mechanisms early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge - a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Whether the mother put, if her daughter are beginning to form the beginnings of breast and lobe hair grow 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes quite prevalent among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time, still parents - usually does not mean a complete puberty," said rapid offensive Kaplowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, lobe and provides the hair and body odor, appear before in girls.
But it was only a small shift in the age of the first period (menarche) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and has decreased compared to 12,75 in 1970.
"after the chest starts to grow, at least two or three years to menarche passes," said Kaplitt, also is the author of the book "early puberty in girls: How to cope with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturation will progress.
There is debate about what is the actual offensive sexual maturity, but is considered to be "premature," when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow or will slow down is that the pediatrician can monitor carefully.
More rapid progression can serve as the basis for analyses have endocrinologist, in order to avoid serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: Premature aging bones, which can ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth in mature age.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz careful with drugs, but acknowledges that "the suppression of puberty may mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers."
Another big problem is clear: Parents simply don't want to have them very young daughters were menstruation.
"They are worried about the risks of pregnancy or even how they cope with health issues," said Kaplitt.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman, whose daughter menstruation began in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and frustrated by the fact that she was the first among his friends.
There are lots of muchheralded theories about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent evidence of what is to blame hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media.
The boys - like puberty in girls have come earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the premise, which has the greatest weight, is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with terms of puberty.
Other data confirm that conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country African and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white likely.
There are various explanations.
All over the world to early puberty, apparently, affects everything from economic conditions and climate change to genes.
Another mystery: Although the boys have hair on the face and the lobe appear at a younger age, the tendency to complete early sexual refurbishment is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors, AAP participating in the conference, confirmed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair found even in infants and children of the nursery age.
"We must be careful about how we define the true offensive puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
"It may mean earlier than expected, the conversation," explained Kaplowitz.
If you keep calm, your child, as a rule, will react well.
Girls who bloom early, you need proof that even when this happens sooner than we needed, this process is a normal part of life.

RBS dissociated two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended from work two traders in his unit on currency transactions, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is yet another proof that global regulators check alleged manipulation in the currency market gains momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they will cooperate with the investigations related to the world's largest financial market regulators, whose daily turnover is $5.3 trillion.
These two trader will be the first by RBS, Ukraine is progressing in the course of the investigation, which echoes the scandal, related to the manipulation of interbank rate LIBOR.
By refusing to comment on the resignation, the bank confirmed that this month he received requests for information from regulators.
"Our current investigation of this issue is still going on, and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other regulators," - reported in the bank two weeks ago.
Last month a knowledgeable person said that RBS to write e-mail and instant messages, which received and sent his former trader, Britain's regulatory body - the Office for controlling financial activities (FCA).
The trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, he granted leave to his current post of chief European spot foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was removed from the work of Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders was not accused of any violations.
The contact group IM Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the Taleban.
The bank UBS reported this week that he has taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator FINMA said he investigates alleged manipulation in the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies in the world - the European Commission, FINMA, the agency Switzerland Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and a currency board of Hong Kong - consider allegations that bankers were in collusion to impact on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began an internal review or have received requests for information from regulators, said a person familiar with the situation.
Banks view instant messages and e-mails for several years in search of offences.
News of the Divine checks of traders in the sphere of activity, which in recent years one of the largest sources of income, which investment banks trading units this year, however, was faced with difficulties due to low volatility of currencies reduces opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation, saying that extensive and aliquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to a senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trades in the currency market, liquidity fragmentation between different trading platforms and wider use of the bank's internal platforms means that "you can begin to have an impact on the market for a very small price."
The news came on the same day, when the bank Credit Suisse announced that it fired one of its traders of the London exchange stock trading this week, after he caused a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with the regulators.
"We are confident that a trader acted alone and that the issue could pinpoint," said Credit Suisse.

Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted out of a good cause and that its tracking operations have saved many lives.
He added: "We are working in the new world, where people are ready to explode themselves.
There are radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, exploding people and attacking the government.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevent the collapse of planes, the explosions of buildings and killing people, because we were able to find out about these plans in advance."

The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
The tour program is still in the development stage, he said.

He said that European leaders must be honest with my people in what they themselves spyware program used for many years.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
Us with his sister were allowed to eat candy, late is not going to bed and to masquerade for our district.
Now I'm more scrag pochodity1.
I don't was called in the last two years giving away candy in his apartment and, most likely, will not and this year.
But statistics show that I am white ravens in regard to Halloween.
According to the National Federation of retail trade, most Americans - namely 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend $6.9 billion in total on candy, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I am looking for every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion from $6.9 billion spent on costumes go away
This year at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects.
Women will no longer be the representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or marks.
As for the men, I think we will see a lot of zombies thanks to "hodyachim serves," and I am sure that the astronauts in the style of a group of Daft Punk will in our tapes work this year.
According to Google, the costumes, which are more often than not, is a zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We did our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only one.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of retail trade, Americans will spend $330 million in this year on the costumes for pets.
This means a lot of funny sobacchotdogov.
When it comes to sweets, we are not melted.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen's on them.
This is about 600 million pounds Chocolate Milk Duds, Barbie fashions, 2GB, sweets, chew sweets Twizzlers and bars Clark Bar.
According to the Ministry of Commerce of the United States, this is a great news for 41 million requiring children's sweets, which prepared to submit our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and - will not deceive ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing that we do not want to eat, is a candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Association confectioners, nearly 35 million pounds sold them for Halloween.
This is about 9 billion separate corn tiny grains.
This is the puzzle, which I have yet to unravels.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween as a haunted house.
They have tremendous names, such as "Horror outside "(which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl and cry" and "House of the shock."
Moreover, according to the society America Haunts, in America have 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses, generating about $500 million of income, as well as the stunning photos, where you're almost opiate that your friend posted on Facebook, and you cannot remove, then the guy who you like, sees this picture and leave a comment like "cool expression."
And finally, talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the great tech, when we were children, and other things that were not punched lamp Jack is like a Christmas tree ornament, what we do from childhood.
Fortunately for us, fashion on a child in take began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us have grown, carved the pumpkin, rather than sitting in them.
According to the US Census Bureau, this year, Americans spend about $106 million on pumpkin.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from the state of Illinois, which raised this year 542 million pounds pumpkin.
If you want a difficult job, visit Tim and Susan Matisson in Napa city of the State of California and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weighing in 2032 lbs.

Investigators of the sheriff of the county Lowndes came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, however, a 17-year-old teenager family disputes this.
"They are absolutely sure that their son was killed," said Benjamin Crump FoxNews.com, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff says.
"They believe that this is contrary to the logic, the laws of physics, as well as common sense," said Crump.
They think that it is a cover for the protection of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"They have sent his son to school with a school bag, and he returned to them in the bag for corpses," he said.
The US attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation of Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
That was the cause of death?
Whether his death was the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will all the facts, wherever they led.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is sufficient reason" for the official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."
But a second autopsy, according to Moore, another showed the cause of death.
"There are issues that must be resolved or to clarify," he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he asked the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the sheriff of the county Lowndes was not available for comment, when applied to him on Thursday.
The judge of the South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to publish all video surveillance cameras, which viewed the investigators.
The parents of a teenage said that they hope that videotapes contain the key to the mystery of how he died.

The owners of pawn shops in Singapore is doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In the mall in Lombard Bendemeer in Singapore Janani Amirthalingan lays golden bracelet, ring and earrings, in order to pay for his daughter's education.
"My husband and I've just bought a house, so all my money invested in there," said Ms. Amirthalingan.
Although she earns S $3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia - where the amount of household debt is growing - is such that ValueMax, where she spends her deal, on this week became the third of the MFA registered on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.
Credit on bail jewelry is not just the fastest way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalingan), but also almost as cheaply as unsecured bank loans.
Usually pawnbrokers in Singapore nachislyat3 effective interest rate in 17% - just above the 15.4% offered in the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or evidence of salary and faster than banks can lend.
However millions of people throughout the region are turning to pawnbrokers, because families are feeling the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth, that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap loans, pished loose monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers, to compensate for the reduction of income as their economies slow growth.
This week's Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, indicated an increase in household leverage, mostly because of rising mortgage, as a risk factor for Asian banks" creditworthiness.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP compared with 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week, hardly came out of technical recession.
Data on Thursday showed continued declines in exports and the weakening of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that people with higher prices in the middle and the bottom of the income scale [] will look for ways to replenish their incomes, where there will only," said Song Seng wun, an economist at CIMB, the Malaysian bank.
A record high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the haste with which people lay their personal belongings, as they use to get money for their family jewelry.
About 70% of things in Singapore, bringing in 200 Lombard city-state points are gold products.
People say, "the price of gold looks good, let's slim gold chain grandmothers and get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops EasyMoney observed an increase in the number of customers who use its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in Lombard business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer and 15 others such as in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, too, says Li Ching, executive director of ValueMax Yeah.
The company will finance the expansion, with 60 percent of S $66 million, attracted this week as a result of placement of shares on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.
While some lenders have caused the fire of criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeoh says that their not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, he also does not increase the debt directly.
"customers lay items that they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households," she said.
Bet wins more wide public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured financing.
And at the same time Lombardi enjoy not only the categories of people who are in dire financial straits.
Rich people in Singapore also use of ValueMax laying gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses, which need to overcome the temporary difficulties," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.

Russian security officials knew nothing about the group "brotherly circle" - New Izvestia
About this INTERFAX.RU writes with a link to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"after it appeared in the media reports about making the Ministry of Finance of the US next stop in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to Eurasian despite the syndicate 'brotherly circle', we reviewed all of the database, but such groups are not found," the priest said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information helps maintain the myth about the so-called Russian mafia, which ostensibly acts abroad.
As previously wrote "OR", the US Treasury yesterday published on its website a list of suspected members of criminal gangs "brotherly circle."
Among them was named and Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He appears in the list as "Grisha," posted the day before.
With the data of popular Russian singer they coincide.
Specified the exact name - Gregory Lepsevridze, creative alias, place and date of birth.
The next stop, there are still five people.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another one a member of the former Soviet Union, whose nationality was not specified.
In the United States are sure that Gregory Leps, which lives on Phuket island ferry for the bandits money on their request.
To this post a photo of the singer and are all its data, which correspond to reality.
Moreover, Leps did recently bought a house in Phuket.
The agency noted that they intend to impose sanctions on next stop.
Putting a man in black American lists of the Ministry of Finance entails blocking its assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him persons residing in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serica said that no notifications to singer is not forthcoming, "it is difficult to answer the question that whether it is Gregory, of which all say now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All that knows Leps is the attention of the media.
Officially to him personally had no notifications, although I don't know whether they are in such cases.
"and, of course, all this, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she said, RIA Novosti.
According to her, on Phuket Grigory Leps not lives, but, as the Ministry of Finance of the United States, the house on the Thai island argues he really is.
She said that Leps is now in a long tour to the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him on the flight to the city Blagoveschensk.

Black box you have in your car?
As long as American designers of roads are trying to find the money to repair highways rasping system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box, neatly prison on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, tracking every proezjaemuu automobilist mile and transmit this information officials, are at the center of controversial attempts to modernize an outdated system of financing America's highways, 13 Washington's routine bodies and state.
Usually boring arena planning highways suddenly has sparked intense debate and colourful alliances.
Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying for the rights of small drawers government to track the number of miles you preseed and even, perhaps, of where you pass them, - and then use this information in drawing up the tax bills.
The tea parties in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about the private lives.
And although Congress wait as long as several states cannot agree to continue or not, will not.
They wonder how in the next decade, you can go to the system, in which drivers pay for every mile of road they cars.
Thousands of motorists already taken for testing these black boxes, part of which have the function of satellite tracking.
It is really necessary for our country.
"It is not the question on which we can be the right choice," said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is preparing plans to start tracking the state authorities miles, preseed every Californian automobilist, by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technology for this is already there.
The need for this is aggravated by the lack of funds for the construction of highways, funded by the expense of government taxes that Americans pay at petrol stations.
Americans already don't buy as much gasoline as before.
Cars passing more miles per gallon.
The federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, not appreciated for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even one cent at high prices for gasoline.
"tax on gasoline is simply impossible to save," said Lee Munnich, transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state was recently installed on cars 500 tracking devices for testing pile payment system.
"this will be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
Sandy call this pile user fee.
It is no wonder that this idea attracts urban liberals because, with the help of taxes, it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The authorities in California could to this system in the course of development strategies to achieve targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to fight global warming.
But Bill Shuster, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said that he, too, is considering this system as the most viable long-term alternatives.
Followers of the free market in the fund "Reason" is also delighted of that force drivers to pay for each mile.
"This is not a simple tax that will go away in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of Political Affairs Reason.
People directly pay for what they receive.
This movement is also supported by two former ministers of transport of the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of pil payment.
The US Senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million last year, in which was attended by about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives leaders rejected the proposal because of fears of rural legislators representing voters, which in everyday life often have to come so many miles to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on the way on their own.
The most enthusiasm is manifested in Oregon, where to take part in the experiment in the country held 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon be pay per mile run state instead of a tax on gasoline.
In Nevada, a pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, he is considered.
Illinois probe it on a limited basis with the participation of the truck.
But the I-95 Coalition, which includes transportation departments Pennsylvania, East Coast 17 states, including Maryland, Virginia and Florida), studies, as they will be able to make these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can track them every step.
"concern about the "big brother" and things like this is a big problem," said Allauddin Khan, head of strategy and management issues efficiency in transport department of the State of Nevada.
This was not what people wanted.
When the tests were underway, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warning on its website: "will be very easy to turn these devices in a full-scale tracking devices."
There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which will inevitably widen to store records of their daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult searches are conducted an inexpensive technology, which would have allowed state authorities to take preseed vehicle miles, but no information about the place and time.
If you can do it, Khan said, the public will feel more relaxed.
The search for this technology have led some state agencies to a young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not support in collecting state taxes.
She sought out the emerging market of automobile insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage.
But the device, which she tests, attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, from time to time to be loaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do so, if you have not spent their speed and not spent their location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There have been a few more errors in some of these pilot programs in the state.
There is much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon designers experimenting with providing drivers of different options.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they cannot abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that passing all residents of the state.
In other places are hoping to sell the idea of a wary public, forcing the device to do more, not less.
In New York, transportation officials are seeking to develop nalogooblagangee device, which will also take charge for parking meters, to provide the "pay as pedal" insurance and collect pool speed data in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid congestion.
"motorists will involve the benefits they offer," said in the document urban design.
Some designers transportation systems, however, think about whether all the talk about pil payment are not just a huge otvlecaty factor.
In the city's transportation commission in the San Francisco Bay area, officials say, Congress would have been very easy to overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline.
Additional lump or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, so they paid their fair share.
"there is no need for radical surgery, when all you need to do is to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public relations commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life and a variety of other things.

Pope Francis named the first Cardinals in February
Pope Francis raise to the rank of new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of service on February 22, as announced on Thursday the Vatican.
The cardinals are senior clergy in the Catholic Church following Pope, and they elect popes, so that Francis will appoint its first group of people that ultimately will participate in the choice of his successor.
Currently there are 201 Cardinal.
But after reaching Cardinal 80th age he can no longer take part in the election of the Pope is the prerogative of a group of 120 "cardinalovvyborshikov."
Announcing the news, the Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said before the ceremony of the meeting will be held in the rank of the College of Cardinals, known as consistory.
"Pope Francis decided in advance to announce its decision to convene consistory in February to ease planning other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of the "Catholic vote" organization said that by February, the number of cardinalovvyborshikov probably will decline.
He said that usually dad calls so much the cardinals, as necessary, to bring the number of cardinalovvyborshikov again up to 120, as well as many of the cardinals over 80 years of age, as he chooses.
Consistory next year will have great significance, because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment there is some kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
"will be interesting to see whether the new dad prescribe the cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are insignificant number of the cardinals.
It will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the Council of the cardinals by Francis - a group of eight cardinals from around the world, which mandated to seek ways to reform the church.
In the past, all dad decided on their own.
"Francis has chosen eight cardinals that they helped him," Valero said.
He said that "quite possible" that Francis will turn to cardinal for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before this is all of this for us for the first time.
Valero said that the Pope is usually built office Cardinal Bishops from large parishes, but Francis" is full of surprises - so we do not know whom he named."

The tax for foreign property owners would lead the London bubble bursts
The Treasury has fulfilled a preliminary assessment measures of income tax on capital gains, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne's, who introduced state tax rate of 7% in 2012 budget for homes worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership, not as individuals.
At the moment the amount of homes in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, at 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount on Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "after increasing expenses on expensive homes and the introduction of related legislation against evasion is very difficult to argue that expensive real estate taxation is undervalued regardless of obsolete municipal tax system."
"But this step could lead to some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners do not want to sell it," he added.
The cost of a first-class property - the top 10% of the market housing costs - in the wealthy southwestern London's belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8% in the past year.
According to the study of Savills, prices in central London continued to demonstrate strong growth of 5.6% in annual terms, but their eclipsed actively developing "domestic market" with a spike in the southwest, in the north (7.4%) (6.5%) and in the east of the city.

The next meeting of the Association of Manufacturers, Tyumen region took place at the base of Yalutorovsk automobile plant.
The presentation of the new line for the production of steel pipes line was held within the framework of the event.
As Denis Gribanov told commercial director of the company, in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner held marketing research for the Study of sales markets for steel structures in the Tyumen Region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of industrial pipes in a month.
After that was adopted a decision to change the profile of the plant and equipment installed on it for their production.
Already this year dispatched more than 7,000 tons of products manufactured.
Investment in the factory amounted to more than 120 million rubles told Denis Gribanov.
In October launched a new mill that makes it possible to increase the range.
The plant is produced as a small profile pipes, which is used for agriculture, small Teplice forms of construction and in the furniture industry, as well as large - for the construction industry.
Plan to go out on the production level of 50 thousand tons of products a year, that is about 10 percent of its consumption in Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another activity, the number of employees at the plant has not - it is now 157 people, plans to purchase new equipment - an increase of more than 50 workers.
The company is retraining cadres, and necessary specialists chosen from already available.
In the coming year is planned to introduce the new unit slitting were up to five millimeters thick, which will help reduce production costs, as well as another camp, with the speed of production of pipes to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014 at the company are going to master the production of pipes, which are used in housing.
The management of the company puts the task to close up to 70 percent of Tyumen region needs in this production.
The deputy director of the department of Leonid Ostroumov investment policy, referring to the leaders of production, advised to pay more attention to modernization of machine-building enterprises.
Directed and forms of government support in this industry, which include compensation for interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and its leasing costs.
In the current year for this purpose is to allocate 150 million rubles, two-thirds of that amount has been spent.
The Commission, which will consider the subsidy contracts, taking documents from enterprises to November 15.
In addition, the budget are the costs for local manufacturers participation in international fairs.
For the next year budget includes funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to participate in trade fairs, 3 million - on energy saving programs.
The funds fall to 72 million rubles in compensation for equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region ordered and paid for the oil and gas industry.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the long run this form of support will be stopped, as the motive for its introduction was compensation for the mining tax, which the oil company paid to the regional budget.
At present they do not and subsidies become direct spending commitments in the region.
Given the priority of this government believes direct support of industrial enterprises, not funding through them, the oil industry.
The aid budget will be tied to the investment projects, which will be implemented on the production.
Many executives of companies have expressed concern in connection with the emerging situation in relations with Neftyanik.
Minimum on coupe their equipment is a competitive advantage of industry southern Tyumen region, and when it is difficult for its repeal will compete on price with the median strip of Russia, where cheaper labor.
In addition, the unclear issue with a succession of TNK-BP, Rosneft's new owner, which does not yet place their orders in Tyumen enterprises.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and applications for its extension did not.
Currently the company's southern region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The open question remains as to whether taxes from oil produced in Swat district in the budget in the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of new owner fields.

Syria has destroyed their means of manufacturing chemical weapons, the group says
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, while fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, not far from one of the objects, which is believed to have stored toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, Syrian activists said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The statement of the United Nations to ban chemical weapons was done in one day before
November 1, the deadline set by this organization based in The Hague to Damascus destroyed or "made it unworkable "all the means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow you to mix chemicals with poison gas and fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction, is an important milestone in the ambitious schedule, which is out to destroy all chemical weapons to Damascus by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.

The message: Obama's campaign headquarters considered an exception Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered to replace Vice President Joe Biden candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the electoral list of 2012.
This discovery is the most striking sensation of all expected Mark Galperin and John Heilemann books about the 2012 campaign" Bets doubled: The game has changed 2012."
The publication of The Times obtained a copy of the works to the exit of the book and reported on Thursday night that the president's closest aides held "extensive research in focus group discussions and public opinion polls at the end of 2011," to assess whether Biden's exclusion may help raise Sabbath hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to The Times political observer Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by senior officials of the election headquarters and the White House, namely, the former head of the White House administration Bill Daily, assess what effect will vote on the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton's vice president.
A possible replacement was a mystery, carefully guarded in Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers - including Daily, former head of the election headquarters Obama's Jim go and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that the replacement is considered.
The book "Bets doubled" claims that Daily was the initiator attempts to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationships," but ultimately abandoned this step, when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral roll not "Obama's chances will improve significantly."
In an interview with Martin Daily confirmed that the administration really considered to replace Biden Clinton.
"I actively addressed for the consideration of so many things, and this was one of them," said Daily newspaper.
You have to remember that at the time the president was in terrible shape, so we thought: "God, what do we do?"
Although Daily described the study as "the necessary checks," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper representative that the election headquarters quite a lot invested in the study of whether the move would bring dividends on the vote.
"campaign teams do not spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups, if they do not consider something seriously," said Martin in the AK 360.
What is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team studied to replace.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daily, whether his then boss knew about possible retasked.
Although Daily and said he doesn't think that the president was aware of "a possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that," "may," Obama knew.
Martin added that "Bets doubled" does not give a clear answer to the question whether political sensing results have reached up to Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believes that Obama did not know about the study opportunities Biden is excluded from the electoral list.
"possible," Martin said.

Legislative bans have forced the Russians to drink less beer
The Russian biaxial bad mood.
According to their proceeds, beer consumption in the country in the coming year will remain at the same level, and it is at best.
Although businessmen originally hoped for growth.
For the current year is unfortunate for them: Sales fell to 7 percent.
About all this told the head of one of the largest brewing companies of the country, the chairman of the Council of the Russian Union biaxial Isaac Sheps on III of the annual conference of the Institute of Adam Smith's "The goods daily demand in Russia," which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed state regulation of the market.
The Russian beer market has decreased by 18 percent from 2008 to 2012, because in recent years in the country there is a substantial strengthening regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and trafficking - drink beer with a low alcohol content, said listeners Sept.
In no country in the world is not such a tough restrictions of the beer market, unpredictable introducing more and more illogical taboos that obosnovyvautsya allegedly struggle with alcohol abuse.
Brewer complained that many legislative bans, designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse, did not have much influence, yet constantly appear all new initiatives.
Worse all the beer producers hit introduced from this year the ban to sell alcohol in kiosks.
"We have immediately lost 35 thousand customers," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year the biaxial two forecast.
Optimistic is that spoke of Seps: Foam drink sales continue at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
In order to maintain their profits, businessmen are forced to leave from varieties, calculated on the mass consumer, in a class of "premium": Beer will be less, but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, radical consequences from the fall of sales with a little alcohol is not in sight.
"according to my observations, the disease of alcoholism remains roughly at the same level, said Alexei vrachnarcolog wide defamation campaign.

Would lead the construction of TPU in Moscow
With each passing year the capital authorities promise to furnish more transportnoperesadochnyh knots (TPU).
Until 2020 is scheduled to enter into service 255 TPU.
What actually is the project, assorted our correspondent.
A couple of months ago "Smolensk" ArbatscoPokrovskoy subway line have a construction fence.
The inscription is stated that the resettlement project node.
All of this was very strange, because next to "Smolensk" no land transport does not stop and, therefore, you cannot take on him.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to overcome some 130 meters, including ground transition through Carmanita lane.
Now, almost all "Smolensk" have finished.
Disappeared flower stall, demolished stand for newspapers, and asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced by the residents.
That's the hub.
Transportnoperesadochnye nodes are plastic and capital," explains in the press service of the capital's transport department.
Capital TPU as long as it is not.
And billets suggest the construction of parking, the withdrawal of trade objects that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, planet TPU even do not transporters, and professional blagoustroiteli from the department of major overhaul of the city of Moscow.
The transport unit is not necessarily complex design, explains the Higher School of Economics, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and transport policy Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes a roof over his head and the scoreboard operas about the time of arrival of transport.
Here, for example, the "establishment" metro have recently opened a full-fledged billets locations node.
Even without canopies, but with privatives parking lots and the scoreboard, indicating that when the bus comes.
But in pursuit of officials record in TPU all that neither once.
Back in 2011, the Mayor's Office planned to build all of these 151 node, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now in the plans until 2020 are up 255 TPU.
Of these some 200 promise to pass more this year.
Although in the city have TPU development program, has not indicated any qualitative criteria," Alexander Morozov concludes, co-chair of the public organization "City and transport."
Report on the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: First - reducing the time transplantation, second - convenience.
First of all to change of transport, not going out in the rain.
In Moscow, the after-school TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the underground "VDNH."
Before suburban buses with Yaroslavsky highway came in the square in front of the main entrance at VVC.
Now they stop moved on the opposite side of the street Yaroslavsky focus.
Farther from the metro, much further from morels, but closer to residential homes.
The gift that residents do not want to bus station under windows and complained in every possible instance.
With capital TPU in Moscow had somehow immediately.
The first of them began to build five years ago in the underground "Planner."
The project is intended to have been a model.
And indeed is an example of how the node locations, bequeathed to investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are persons for buses, shed, not to go from the subway in the rain, and the three floors car parking spaces.
True, Khimkinsky trolleybus No. 202 and 203 in Moscow TPU places have not fundamentally.
Them as someone else's postponed away from the metro.
But the place under trade more left.
One only 32 clothing store, and in general have almost everything - from pet products to a car dealership.
Well, in fact, suddenly who of bus passengers will need to buy a new car in the road?
We have, when build capital TPU, for some reason always out shopping centre.
The situation reached its logical conclusion, as part of a parking lot recently decided to give it to the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planner" among razmechennyh parking spaces on the floor is brisk market.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and the security guards, angrily pogladyvangie on our photographer.
The node locations have finally turned into a bazaar.
The point is that before the subway "Planner" market, but it was demolished.
But in Prefecture traders regretted and go on privatives parking organization host.
All the same because of high prices there are always empty.
The same ridiculous that market demolished in order to build in its place... new billets TPU.
So here's rock.
The distance from the lobby metro subway "Kaluga" have to bus was 50 meters, said Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the trade center, allegedly TPU, distance has increased to 170 meters.
In order to get on a bus, you have to go through the whole mall.
After 22 hours, when it closed, have to circumvent it under the open sky.
However, construction on "Player" and "Kaluga" soon seem around the neck.
The mayor's office in the middle of September gradostroitelnozemelnaya Commission approved planning solutions for the first eight capital TPU.
Four of them will be 25etazhnsmi, not counting two or three underground floors.
The monster will grow from underground "Tushino," it will be 4187 thousand square meters.
Representatives of the railway stations Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of TPU underground, have already told reporters: In future meetings raspolojitysya3 shops, hotels and apartments.
Officials argue that parking lot Zai mouth from a third to half of the square.
Take for example the "people's" garages.
Say, garage for 258 machinest, which recently built on the international street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for parking at 2.6 thousands of auto "PetrovscoRazumovskoy" will need about 80 thousand "squares."
It is less one third from the machine that there are going to build.
Let one or two floors will be spent on any person for buses.
Remains of at least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate.
And this, in a minute, almost two GUM.
If capital TPU stations and stations have build railway workers, then the rest of the site will be master metropolitans.
They also promised that there will be a lot of functional facilities, including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
By the way, in the department of Moscow's city property had reporters recently that develop the draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot to TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Because, they say, that transportation issues for the city is the priority.
Ideal TPU is, for example, "Harvard" station in Boston or "Spadina" in Toronto, is confident Alexander Morozov.
Trolley buses and trams there descend underground to the level of underground and distance approach from subway cars to trams is only 50 meters without access to the street.
Around any unnecessary trade.
But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.
Or will build nothing, or that otgrohaem 25 floors with offices and apartments.

Bombardier profit declines with the fall of supply and the number of orders for planes
Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, said Thursday on reducing net profit by 15 percent under the influence of lessives number of orders and deliveries of the planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail unit.
Located in the Montreal company Bombardier also published no data on flight testing its new CSeries aircraft and not provided new information about whether ambitious plans to introduce the aircraft will be performed in commercial operation to the next September.
After the first flight of the prototype aircraft, held about one and a half months ago, he flew only three more times that raises questions about whether the stage of testing on schedule.
The results were acquitted of forecasts and led to a fall in shares of more than 8 percent of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered its rating from "higher on Thursday as "before" as "because of the belief that the growth of the shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
"Although the decline in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we, of course, disappointed profit indicators of the transport department," said Derksen in the review of the stock market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders as it unfolds flight test program.
Nevertheless, if in the coming months will not be announced new orders, we assume that the market will become more skeptical to the program.
Bombardier hopes that the family of the CSeries aircraft will allow her to win a seat in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March and made the flight in September for the first time after several months of delay.
But the firm order for the CSeries yet not too much - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests, to check the company's assertions about the fuel efficiency and new liner potential efficiency.
There are only now 403 order and an agreement with 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin was confident that Bombardier will reach its goal in 300 firm orders by the time when the first aircraft will be launched in commercial operation.
On Thursday the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan.
"test model of the aircraft remained on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests were planned on aircraft downtime and software updates.
All manufacturers plan to tests in different ways.
We decided to conduct the first flight and make a break on the upgrade, and so we did.
So will occur during the flight test program.
The second of five test samples should make a flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow him, as reported by the company.
Yet analysts skeptical statement about the fact that the first client will be able to start operating CSeries aircraft after 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it estimates the commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow the pace of flight tests - at least, apparently, and corresponds to the domestic schedule Bombardier - reinforces our view that commissioning will be moved to the first quarter of 2015," said Derksen.
In the third quarter, Bombardier okonchivshemsya September 30, net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.
Gross profit decreased slightly, to $4.1 billion from $4.2
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth in the world's largest aircraft maker reported that he has put 45 aircraft for the quarter that less than in the previous year - 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders aerospace division was $32.9 billion at September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"in the aerospace field results consistent with our goals, however, a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become unpleasant factor," said Beaudoin.
Gross income on cosmic direction fell 13 percent to $2 billion
Bombardier, the world's largest maker of trains, reported that gross income in this sector grew by nearly 11 percent, to $2.1 billion
The portfolio of orders in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion at September 30, slightly higher than from December 31.
The transport unit income negatively influenced the problems with the fulfillment of several large contracts.
Management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
The company's shares Bombardier, which also announced that chief financial officer of Google Patrick Pichette will go down in the board of directors, fell by 8.5 percent to C $483 on trading in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor Bombardier, said Thursday about reducing quarterly earnings by 10 percent.

Two of the YMCA employee accused of sexual crimes even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, has become known as the Royal Commission
Two staff members of the YMCA NSW were accused of sexual crimes against children to allegations in 2011 against child care institutions in Caringbah worker Jonathan Lord, said the Royal Commission on sexual violence against children.
But in the opening statement of the commission was told that she "never had affairs with cases of sexual abuse of children within their organization."
Chief Executive Director Philip Hair was asked about one case, when the YMCA worker was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and about another case, when the YMCA Caringbah Hall gym instructor was convicted of sex crimes against children under his supervision, in 1991.
Mr. Hair gale Furness, a lawyer, said the provider of aid commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA in an introductory speech to the commission also allowed the inaccuracy, arguing that "external checks were YMCA, press that YMCA is in the forefront to ensure the safety of children."
The commission evidence suggests that YMCA was notified that she received the second from the end of the four possible ratings based on the results of the audit quality, made by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA, when he was 21 years, admitted that he and digesting leadership made the miss newly-signed Lord, and also failed to provide a clear understanding of their commitments related to reports of violations of security policy staff of children.
Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual crimes against 12 boys within two years of his work at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the suggestion that corporate ethics YMCA prevented employees to report violations Lord in the security sphere of children.
The employees testified that they observed violations, including what Lord was alone with the children, personally nursed them set them in his lap, said that he loves one of them and let them play their mobile phone.
Daniel Ockwell, which was led by Lord and asked to teach her child protection, because it is concerned about his behavior, testified that found Jackie Barnett, manager of guardianship over the children of YMCA in Caringbah, who was head of the Lord," is very frightening and often trudnodostupnoy."
The executive director said that he does not accept the explanation employees about the fact that it was embarrassing to report on the situation of their senior leaders.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord led them from thoughts about the need to report it.
Mr. Hare said he presented the board YMCA New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization of the "accident with Jonathan Lord" not to provide information" on the part of the staff, and the board agreed with him.

Bin Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: Furthermore
You can safely say that New York is a place of birth stendapkomedii in America: Almost a hundred years ago pop artist Frank Faye, who entertainer in the theater of the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Innovation Fay eventually picked other, more recently, the New York comedy festival.
Created and curated Caroline Hirsch, founder stendapcluba Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and theaters.
"most of these there started at Carolines, and then achieved more success, have reached a level when they are already too famous to act in the club," said Hersh.
We have created this festival as a way to continue to work with them.
This year's event includes performances Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as "stands for heroes" - a charity concert for military veterans in the annual muzykalnocomedia Madisonskvergarden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby appear among others.
With the extension of the festival has grown and the comedy world.
A few comedians participating in the festival this year, gained popularity by unconventional means, for example, thanks to the show on television channels like Comedy Central, FX and followed.
Nick was gained fame thanks to roles in comedy series on little-known cable TV (ostentatiously sabres "League" by FXX on fantasyfootball), and now leads his own sketches on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate entered the cast as in "Saturday night in a live broadcast," as in "Parks and recreation areas," although most of all she is known for a series of viral videos "Marseille - rack in boots."
And of all time, and Slate, like other young comedians with original style (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, sly, focused on racial subjects Kamau Bell), is the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as stendapcomic, but then became a successful director on television and in the movies, as well as unofficial historian comedy.
From 2005 to 2007 he was leading the show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"this city - Larry is certainly a central element of all the work," Steinberg said.
He told me that coming here, he sometimes walks on a street between the two houses and think, "that's if I stay at all without money, perhaps, I'm going to live here."
