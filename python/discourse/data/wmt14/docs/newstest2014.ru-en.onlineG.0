Anger over the sentence the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
Survivors and relatives 202 killed in the bomb blast in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the conspirators on trial, and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years in hiding, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in creating the explosive device used in the attack.
He may be released within 15 years if you get parole.
45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings as a result of attacks on two Nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and wounded dozens more.
He also was found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including in a wave of explosions churches across Indonesia on Christmas eve 2000.
Prosecutors demanded life imprisonment, although they could insist that a man nicknamed «the Demoman» for his reputation masters for the production of explosive devices, should be sentenced to death.
This decision has aggravated the painful memories of the mother of Perth June Кортин who lost their 39-year-old daughters-twins Jane and Jenny in the attack, effected Патеком and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Choking back tears, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
«I really think that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must stand before the firing squad, " said Ms. Кортин AAP.
- I must live each day knowing that I won't have grandchildren and I see my daughters.»
Club «Sari» was destroyed when was powered by a massive explosive device, embedded in a parked outside the van, immediately after 11 p.m. October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the bar «paddy», where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives in just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack it for a month fell into a coma and died three times, being connected to the life-support system.
Mr. Hughes said Patek must share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiah, which is responsible for the bloodbath - Амрози, Мухласа and Imam Самудры who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Get 20 years after killing 202 people and injured hundreds - it's not much.
Patek is the last of the participants in the terrorist attack in Bali, appearing before the court.
He has been hiding for nearly ten years, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American troops killed the former leader of al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial FBI agent showed that the intelligence testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and al-Qaida.
«He did not give up,» said Ms. Кортин.
Until recently, he never regretted about how much pain he has caused others.
The sentence eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
«This year will be a lot of tears», - says Ms. Кортин.
Patek still can appeal their sentence.

Manufacturers of jet aircraft are about the width of the seat, when the stake large orders
Between the leading aircraft manufacturers, a bitter dispute erupted over the width of the seat tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a violent confrontation at the Dubai air show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seat provided on long-haul flights, passengers of economy class, whose interests are not always in the center of attention of airlines, while the amount of allocated space plays a key role in making statements about the efficiency of the last aircraft offered Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the industry standard, which would seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in the salons of economy class, but its main American rival Boeing says that this should be decided by the airline.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft producers compete in sales of larger and larger versions of their twin-engine aircraft, and the event 17-21 November are expected to potentially record orders.
The layout of the rear part of the plane, sit whether 9 or 10 people in a row, occupies a Central place in the statements about the economic effectiveness of new projects «mini-Airbus».
Boeing says its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people on the basis of the seats in economy class for more than 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a competing version of its A350 will be transported in economy class seats 350 people for a width of 18 inches, located 9 in a row.
Giants aircraft often exchanged blows on technical issues through advertising in trade press.
And now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what can be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers slide depicting three people in the restaurant, pressed to each other, called «You would agree to that?»
«Boeing offers long-haul flights on the seats are narrower than that of regional turboprop aircraft», - said the head of the sales Airbus John Leahy.
With diet changes people gaining weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed cardinally.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 asked standards of modern long-distance travel, and abroad century weight of the average American men aged 40 to 49 years old increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of health.
Waist circumference of the average American men of the 21st century is 39,7 inches, according to the statistics of the United States.
Airbus argues that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats 1950s, when the average waist those who recently called the «jet public», was already.
Airbus says commissioned a study showing that extra inch in width seat improves the quality of sleep is 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the figures Airbus size seats and said that producers should not interfere in the decisions about how the airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
«All really boils down to providing airlines choice and the opportunity to do what they believe they must do to achieve success,» the expert said Boeing salons Kent Крейвер.
They do not want, that we decide for them that will bring them profits.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers is increasingly becoming a factor that can influence on profit.
For this dispute is worth the race for the orders for aircraft, valued at least $700 billion in catalogue prices in the coming decades is enough to change the balance of American and European exports.
As first reported in July, Reuters, the location of the seats - this is exactly what rivalry heats up in the battle between the latest jet planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20% increase profitability on the one place in their latest twin-engine long-range models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
These performances Boeing partially based on a comparison of 10 seater series 777X with the original 9-seater layout of the rows of a constructive solution to 777.
Win in the unit cost decreases when compared with the 10-seater layout, currently used.
«The reason why Boeing is doing this, is to squeeze in more places and make your flight more competitive than our developments,» said Kevin Кенистон, head of comfort for passengers, the Airbus in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say saloons with full 10-local rows to existing 777-x indicate that many passengers prefer dense placing, which go hand in hand with lower rates.
«Seat width eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the sentence Airbus due to the threat from 777-th model,» the expert said on interior Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply the chair, but the offer supplier directory, from which the airline can choose.
Travelling on the world sellers jets even travel around with a roulette to check competing plan.
Praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer planes with a very dense arrangement of the cabin for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local rows, but says she's already sold.
Until recently, Airbus had emphasized the need for additional modifications salons, offering a wider space to pass on some of their planes.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, as the experts say, her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to «fly», but may distract attention from the wave of selling model 777X.

Security concerns in Mozambique is growing due to the conflict influential people
Under взирающей them down from the top of the statue of Samora Machel, founder-President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant slogans of the world on one of the rare here demonstrations.
«We want to return the world; we want stability,» said Vanessa de Sousa, Executive Director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of their country, and she changed her business suit for a t-shirt decorated with an inscription «We demand security» in Portuguese, and joined on Thursday, the crowd in the capital's Independence Square.
Within two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo is one of the most violent clashes since the conclusion of the truce more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a popular insurgency, which was supported by the first white authorities Rhodesia, and then the government of South Africa's apartheid-era efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the armistice of 1992 it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country will hardly again revert to full-scale conflict, but recent events have made nervous foreign investors and the local people.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore reserves of gas and coal deposits in the North-West could raise over $50 billion in investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the USA.
The ruling party Frelimo, the leading political force since 1975, and the party Renamo accuse each other of the current tensions.
Party Renamo claimed that the government was the instigator of the recent clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamo, October 17.
The attack on the former rebels then exacerbated when government troops attacked the base Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Дхлакаму - leader of the group, told the newspaper the Financial Times Fernando Мазанга, the representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo in triggering clashes, blaming the party in the attack on the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel the fears of instability.
Guebuza said AFP, the French news Agency on Wednesday that Mr. Дхлакама felt a «loser», захотевшим use «all that remains of his strength, to try to prove that he is able to impose a government of their own decisions».
As Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid the war.
However concerns have increased after reports that Мазанга said about the refusal of Renamo from the peace agreements of 1992.
He told the Financial Times that meant the failure of the agreement the party Frelimo.
«Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously,» said Мазанга.
The previous negotiations between the parties have made little to ease tensions, which strengthened a series of clashes this year.
«It's two influential person (Guebuza and Дхлакама), foreheads touching,» said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and expert in Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Party Renamo, trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this as an attempt to pressure the weakened movement concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
Share of votes for Renamo declining since 1992, while the new party - Democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based former member of the Renamo is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Мазанга says Mr. Guebuza, who must step down next year, when the end of his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
«He does not want to multiparty democracy, he does not want to transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the post of President,» said Мазанга.
Unclear what capabilities does the Renamo, however, she already had a devastating and violent attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key highway leading from North to South.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers North of Maputo, but includes Бейру port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal.
In June, the Rio has suspended the use of Railways for about a week after Renamo threatened attack on the railway.
Мазанга was evasive when he asked to repeat whether Renamo this threat.
Party Renamo wanted to «warn the international community that the case in Mozambique are not very good,» said Мазанга.
Instability has strengthened discontent with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and frequent recently kidnapping, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
«People think that responsibility for the future of the country rests with the government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems,» he says.
Omar Султуан, demonstrator, said that people just want to stability.
«No one cares no Renamo, nor Frelimo, they just want to resume peace, they want free access to the roads,» he said.

The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which supposedly operates abroad, believe in the power structures.

Scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail of the dog connected with her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wag their tails towards the right (from the point of view of a dog), while the other dog помахивают tail mainly in the left side.
But now scientists say that other representatives of canids can detect these subtle differences in the impact of the tail and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Валлортигара, neuroscientist from Trent University, says: «it is Well known that people left and right sides of the brain differently participate in the formation of inducements that evoke positive or negative emotions.»
We attempted to look at this and other species.
He added that, as the man with the dogs right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and Vice versa, and two hemispheres have played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to various повиливания tails of other dogs, the researchers observed the animals when they watched films about the other dogs.
They measured heart rate animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably, soon we will understand why their tails sometimes sent in one direction and sometimes in another
Professor Валлортигара said: «We showed dogs videos with dogs of any naturalistic version or of a silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we have been able to manipulate the movement of the tail and direct tail more to the left or right».
When the animals saw that for the rest, nothing expressing dog moved her tail to the right, from the point of view of the shuffling tail of the dog), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed the tail inclined mainly to the left (again in terms of shuffling tail of the dog), their heart rate uchashchalos ' and they looked alarmed.
Professor Валлортигара said that he did not think that dogs are deliberately communicated with each other by using these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dog learned from your experience, what movements they should worry about, and what - not.
He said: «If this takes place several meetings with other dogs and often swerving their tail in one way connected with the more friendly behaviour, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience».
The researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and tamer deeper understanding of the emotions of his animal.
Expert in the field of behaviour of dogs John Bradshaw, visiting research fellow at the veterinary school of the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to test whether a value for dogs left and right sides.
Last year a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found out that the dog turn of the head to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and the right, if you look at rather a dog.
And in another research of the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: «the Dog more often came to the dog-robot wobbling her tail was subjected to left instead of right, instead of getting anxious, the opposite behavior in relation to the Italian research.»
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the different studies are not fully perceived animals in the movies or dogs-robots as dogs.
Might be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.
«While various mammals there is sufficient evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many of the details still to be clarified, and the dog is not an exception,» he said.
However, given the ease with which may be registered by their behavior, probably, soon we will understand why their tails sometimes sent in one direction and sometimes in another.

Attended the General discontent of the single market and business representatives stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in a shopping district Europe, agreed that, even 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally the most Pro-European-minded of all the companies.
The last and most demonstrative - our Executive opinion survey revealed that a clear majority wants the United Kingdom conducted a course on modification of the agreement and the relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This result, which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and largest business groups shows that business insists on a «significant change», which will return the powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high - achieving changes in the contract and are more favorable terms for the UK will provide the 16 percent shift in voting to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should be no doubt: this survey shows that the British business support his plan review the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.

In Siberia it is not worth being vegan: greenhouse tomato is no substitute soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia figured out the correspondent of RIA Novosti.
People completely refused from food of animal origin, should not live in Siberia.
Here they not survive the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes their compensate, according to respondents, the eve of a vegan Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors.
Drink liters of oil
Strict vegetarianism, when abandoned not only from meat and fish, but from milk, honey, eggs, became a fashionable lifestyle.
However, dieticians believe that in Novosibirsk and other Siberian cities to follow such strict regulations in the diet, at least not useful for health.
A complete rejection of animal products harmful.
In animal protein contains amino acids, which is very difficult to compensate for the plant.
You need to be sure to include in the diet of at least milk or eggs," - sure nutritionist Marina Богай.
She cites the example of fish containing an indispensable fatty acid omega-3.
The richest them and vegetable oil, Flaxseed.
"To consume it necessary for a person quantities need liters of drinking!" - says nutritionist.
Doctors are sure that the inhabitants of Siberia special attention to the diet should be given in the winter.
In this season vegetarianism especially questioned.
In terms of our realities high requirements to the food.
Not to freeze, need high caloric content.
"If a person limits on animal products, respectively, the caloric he arrears," the specialist said.
Agree dietician Olga Pazniak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits - no way.
A person to eat mostly foods that are grown in the region of residence or the place where he was born.
The genetic code is set up for the best absorption and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people don't want a pickle chew and hot soup or something посытнее", explains its position doctor.
According to her, that may have vegans really help a variety of cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples, remaining in the winter, frozen berries.
But this is definitely not enough for full power.
According to the doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Арифулиной, Siberians in the organism of vitamin a sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
Full transition to vegetarianism in our toughest environmental conditions where the temperature may for the day change to 30 degrees, and in may, the snow is not advisable.
Body for life needs energy, and this, first of all, fat," says the doctor.
Doctors say that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need a construction material, including in the form of amino acids.
While adhering to the principles of vegetarianism, we give defective.
Pregnant women also need to be increased content of protein, vitamins, and trace elements in the menu.
"Веганки them receive less," - sure Богай.
Arifulina says that an adult person is free to choose anything, "to play toys that wants to".
He had already formed the body, a skeleton bodies.
And children should eat well.
If the parents deprive him of some microelements and amino acids, choosing for him what he shall eat, this is just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bone tomorrow is no longer to recover," she says.
All the interviewed medical experts agree on the low quality of cultivated in greenhouses and winter imported vegetables and fruits.
That we bring and grown in greenhouses, contains fewer required us trace elements than (grown in open ground.
"Quality products", - says Богай.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of manufacturers to collect a greater yield is detrimental to the quality.
"The apples turn brown at the cut cucumbers quickly fade and grow mouldy, tasteless tomatoes and неароматные", - gives examples medic, adding that they, most likely, are crammed with excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And not become the suppliers of vitamins, and fiber.
Disagree head of the laboratory of Siberian physical-technical Institute of agrarian problems, candidate of agricultural Sciences Faith Petruk.
She says that with the right approach, and observance of all norms and requirements in greenhouses is possible to grow full of vegetables.
If you try to expel more square meter, of course, and the water will become more and overfeed plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too much nitrogen fertilizer, tomatoes are growing rapidly, they are large, but are watery and savoury"she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends conscience from the manufacturer.

Russia beyond the struggle for urban pollution cars
Attempts to solve the transportation problems of big cities were observed in most cities in the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule was either their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or attempting to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars and the time of their use.
A well-known example of Singapore, where the introduced strict quotas increase the number of private cars, and the right of their acquisition bought at auction.
Its price may be two to three times higher than the price of the car.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry to the city center.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing so-called green zone, where entrance is allowed only vehicles with certain экоклассом using fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Agency of environment protection Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 "five year plan for clean air", worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As told to "Kommersant" the Director of the division for control transport pollution, the municipal Bureau of environmental protection Beijing Whether Куншенг, the main goal of the five year plan - reduction of the leading air pollutants on 20-35% by 2017, the growth in the number of private cars, to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million)and increase of no more than 5% of fuel use per vehicle.
According to the Agency, now the vehicles in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme - the restriction of the use of motor transport, as well as the introduction of additional tax for car owners.
Among other things, urban measures "green five-year plan include accelerated compared with the rest of the country transition to European standards of fuel, introduction of local eco-standards and labels for cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of vehicles in the Central part of the city, bans on older vehicles (in addition, creating a financial incentive programmes replacement of old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), development of electric transport (including public and official), development of public transport (including broadband).
Among the automotive innovation Beijing prohibition also applies to all private cars on movement within the fifth ring road (just in the Chinese capital six) one day of the week relevant information is contained in a number plate of the vehicle), and the issuance of registration plates for vehicles based on a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of a lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing amounted to only one-third the amount of 2010).
According to the existing state program "environmental Protection in 2012-2020 years, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 year there were 138).
According to the Ministry, in 2011, the "mobile sources accounted for 41% of all pollutants emissions in the cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars in ten times higher than industrial, but in Saint-Petersburg - nine times.
In the Russian Federation yet only start to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Director of the Institute of transport Economics and transport policy of the HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for car travel, it is an unpopular, they can be accepted only if they complete versatility.
In the case of Moscow occurs unique problem connected with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts are service and personal cars as well as cars of the "privileged" users, total number of which is not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total vehicle fleet of Moscow).
Recently urbanists of the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared the study, where the balance of urban areas between residential buildings, the area of road coverage and number of vehicles.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city centre is provided roads in two times less than required, and the majority of car owners living in the centre, not to use their cars every day, leaving them on for a long time in Parking lots or just on the streets.
In result, it is proposed to build no Parking, and storage of cars, not expand, and reduce roadway (so that the streets were more friendly to pedestrians and to limit the use and disposal of personal transport within the boundaries of the buffer zone of the historic centre (total area about 3212 hectares, covering a number of Central areas of the city).

«We take 500 people in each trip,» said Бвелле.
They come from all over the territory in radius of 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated points or free of birth certificate - the documents necessary for the school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually held in a school building, a municipality, or in the house; after the procedure patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitary processing of the equipment, Бвелле and its volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.
This back-breaking pace, but purposefulness brigade usually help to maintain a village musicians.
«They all night beating drums, so we watched and continued to work», - said Бвелле.
On Sunday the members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group of камерунских doctors and foreign medical students conducted 700 free transactions last year, and they know that their assistance can be of immense value to those they are helping.
One man explained that he had received free surgery for the treatment of hernia will allow it to work again.
«This will change the future for me and my family,» said the man.
In addition to these clinical techniques in the weekend and work in the hospital surgeon Бвелле also works nights in private health clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second job, he said, provides 60 % of funding non-profit organization, and the remaining funds are covered by private donations.
«I don't even know when he's asleep,» said Katie O'malley, a medical student of the second course Дрексельского University in Philadelphia, a volunteer group Бвелле.
He always either in the hospital or tries to earn money for the organization to continue this campaign.
For future doctors and nurses like O'malley, coming from the USA and Europe to join the Бвелле in its tasks, it is possible to practice, which they would never have at home.
«We have an opportunity to assist in the operations, where we have helped to remove the stain of blood or keep tools for doctors Бвелле», said O'malley.
Being a sophomore, you would never have in America.
Student volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often coming from the donated drugs.
But on arrival in Yaounde their food, transportation, and tuition is paid by the Бвелле.
«He is a hero, without a doubt,» said O'malley.
He gives his life, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon endlessly.
For Бвелле almost constant workloads not is a difficult challenge.
Help live a happy life with others, doing this to his father the promise is what brings him great joy.
«I'm so happy when I make this work, " said Бвелле.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do that to people laughed to reduce their pain.

The "Russian mafia" in the United States was finalized new name - "brotherly circle"
This week's black list "Russian mafia" in America filled with new names and four companies.
The Ministry of Finance of the USA has introduced the "brotherly circle" three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigoriy Leps, which the U.S. is suspected in the transportation of money to members of the group.
All in all, the black list of the US 22 people involved in the "Brotherly circle", and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts expressed doubt that such an organization exists.
"Statement of 'Brotherly circle' more like trying to unite isolated criminal groupings", - said an expert on organized crime and Professor at new York University, mark Galeotti.
According to him, "brotherly circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".
"I haven't met anyone Russian law enforcement bodies, or elsewhere, who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization", - quotes Mr. Galeotti American Center for the study of organized crime and corruption.
With Mr. Galeotti agrees and Professor at George Mason University Liz Shelley.
"If they act together, then it's more like a criminal network, but not the organization", - quotes its words the Center for the study of corruption and organized crime.
In the middle of last year, mark Galeotti suggested that "brotherly circle" unites more fully close the Russian kingpin Usoyan known as grandpa Hassan.
Crime boss was killed in January this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Шушанашвили and Zechariah Kalashov, adding to the list in 2012, was closely associated with the Grandfather Hassan, another participant of the list, Темури Mirzoyev, was a Grandfather Hassan's nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personality and have no relation to Usoyan.
According to him, all combined the rather General financial and criminal interests, such as drug trafficking from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal around the inclusion of the "brotherly circle" of Grigory Leps - favorite singer of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin - has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive from our American colleagues, partners of more detailed information, in connection with which such decision was made, why he is in such lists are made, - said the press-Secretary of the head of state, Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As the interests of all Russian citizens, its interests will be protected.

Сноудена can interrogate in Russia
The ex-employee of U.S. intelligence Edward Snowden, most likely, will not leave Russia to testify in cases of tapping telephone conversations German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As "Interfax" on Friday a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer the questions of the representatives of the Prosecutor General of Germany in writing, or in absentia in Russia.
Departure of Edward Сноудена outside Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he will lose his refugee status and may be issued Washington allies of the USA", - said the Agency interlocutor.
"However, in principle, the Prosecutor General of Germany could send their representatives in the Russian Federation or to submit written questions Сноудену," the source added, adding that the issue should be worked at the interstate level.
Previously member of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Штребеле said that Edward Snowden ready to testify on the case about the wiretapping of American special services negotiations Chancellor of Germany.
Snowden is ready to testify, German law enforcement authorities, either in Moscow or in Germany.
Ex-CIA official hinted that knows very much.
Despite the fact that the NSA United States blocked all of his movement, Snowden ready to come to Germany.
However, this must clearly define all the terms of his arrival", - said Штребеле to Euronews.
Lawyer Сноудена Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of "Interfax", said his client may cooperate with German investigators, but when and how will solve itself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked on the national security Agency (NSA), the United States and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in may 2013, after which published information about the secret operations of the US security service on surveillance in the Internet.
Snowden was flying through Moscow by transit, but couldn't leave the airport due to the fact that his passport revoked the U.S. authorities, in absentia, who made him serious charges, and until the beginning of August remained in the transit zone of the airport "Sheremetyevo".
First of August Snowden had a paper about granting him temporary asylum on the territory of Russia for the period of year and on the same day left "Sheremetyevo".

Children should study the myths and legends as a «model lifestyle», says the author.
Tales of the Torah could show that «brute force cannot win subtle cunning,» and the legend of king Arthur indicate how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many of the myths are «too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools», Crossley-Holland stands for «careful selection of» appropriate age texts.
«I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of the education,» he said.
I played for introduction in the curriculum of twenty years.
He added that «excessive moralizing» authors and teachers «beat interest in children, and the basic ideas of «sublimated» in a fascinating history.
Crossley-Holland, who translated «Beowulf» with the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote a «Collection of Norwegian myths» for the publisher, Penguin and «British folk-tales», said: «Of course you can be the intention, but you had better keep it to yourself.»
Perhaps the greatest difference between adult author, writing for adults, and adults author, writing for children is the need to feel any hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary to have an innate understanding of good and evil.
And this should be sublimated; disclosed through the history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle: show, not tell.

Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and large-scale redundancies.
Our main concern now is not the fact that growth has slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.
Recently he is entirely due to the consumption, which almost does not wind speed", - said the chief economist at Goldman Sachs Russia Clemens Graph, representing yesterday quarterly report of the Bank's share on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal growth of wages in Russia - about 10%.
When inflation is 6% he can provide for future consumer demand approximately on the current level, expected Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies falls, therefore, most likely, they will be engaged in optimisation of expenses on personnel.
Today we can see a significant growth of the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, GDP only by 2%, - explained Mr. Graph.
Companies have faced decrease of profitability.
If it grows, it can lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.
Not to raise the salaries of Russian business can't, says chief economist at Barclays Capital in Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historic lows competition for workers is high.
To lure employees, or to keep current, employers are required to raise the salary.
Consumption in Russia is supported and very fast growth потребкредитования.
According to Mr. Column, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country this type of lending has not.
"The benefit to the economy from growth потребкредитования we did not see, money is not diverge in Economics, and returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments", the economist said.
But the problem is - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay for unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to give to the collateral.
Interest rates on these loans are high.
As a result, they often do not return", - said Mr. Graph.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia - possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.
Director of Bank Institute of the HSE Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of impending banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, not having an access to cheap resources, which have state banks were required to raise the population's funds at high interest rates.
In response, the state-owned banks went on the warpath, and lowered loan rates, continues economist.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state-owned banks refuse dumping, Russia will face a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
Licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist believes the harbinger of a mass collapse.
"State-owned banks themselves with such a situation will not cope: the Deposit insurance system was not originally designed for the system crisis", warns the head of the Institute.
But consumption growth will slow and without payment crisis, analysts at investment Bank, due to the rejection of indexation of salaries of civil servants and military incorporated in the current version of the draft budget.
Partially blow consumption will be mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as consequence, reduction of inflation).
But only partially: if the investment is not grow (and prerequisites is that yet - see reference), consumption growth is still slow, sure in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin Barclays Capital does not see any prerequisites for the realization of the pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still falling oil prices," he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will start to decline in the oil price below $ 90/Barr.
In Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank can cut interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation declined and banks started to raise interest rates.
This may indicate that they did not believe the Central Bank, who put out a transition to inflation targeting," said Clemens Graph.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank on market rates does not affect only affects the interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank is a crash of all hope", - said Clemens Graph.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank, banks are used not for lending to the economy, but to manage its liquidity
Once the rate is decreasing, immediately changed the exchange rate, this means that the funds are trying to avoid the speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Column and reminded that to let the ruble float freely" the state plans by the end of 2015.
But you either have to do it earlier, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5 percent), he said.
According to his estimates, the ruble now artificially inflated by 10%.
Ruble only one road - weary, - concludes the expert.
But if the Central Bank provides the финансистах even a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy by the weakening of the ruble, it can crash the ruble much stronger.

FAA: «Air passengers can now use the gadgets on airplanes (but not calls from a mobile phone)»
Passengers can use their own electronic devices during the entire flight to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but do not speak on their mobile phones, according to welcome the new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal aviation administration.
But passengers should not expect that changes will occur immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA, as their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they update their manuals for flight crew and rules laying devices to meet the new guidelines.
The FAA has stated that it has already received the plans of some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have submitted plans.
«Depending on the state plan, we could approve the extension of the use of electronic devices very soon», - said the FAA.
Currently passengers must disable its smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as soon as the door of the plane closes.
They should not restart them until the aircraft has reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain did not give «good».
Passengers must turn off your device again, when the aircraft is reduced for planting, and to exclude them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference, it may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, said the FAA.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft, modified so that the passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Глейдинг, President of the Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed these changes.
«After the new policy will be successfully implemented (and we're going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win situation,» said Глейдинг.
We frankly tired feel «duty to school»when it comes to this subject.
But the connection to the Internet for surfing, e-mail, text messaging or data loading will still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the Agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their phones, tablets, and other devices into airplane mode.
Thus, still no Words from friends,» intellectual Internet-game, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was a notorious example: actor was removed from the plane of airline American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was at the gate.
But heavy equipment such as laptops, would still need to be laid in the Luggage compartment as they can to injury, if you will be flying around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in flight also will continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory authority for phone calls belong to the Federal communications Commission, and not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take off and landing
Last month mark Розенкер of the National transport safety Council, the national expert on the safety of transportation, CBS News, said that cell phones is still considered a risk.
«Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially cause harmful interference to navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they may interfere with cell tower when the plane is in the air,» said Розенкер.
Industry Advisory Committee established by the FAA to study this issue, recommended last month that the government allowed the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure mounted on the FAA, with the aim of easing restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator from Missouri Claire Маккаскил, argued that the prohibitions are no valid reasons related to safety.
Compliance with the restrictions also becoming increasingly difficult to achieve, because the use of the devices became widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore directives turn off your devices.
The FAA started to restrict the use of passengers electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers started to carry FM radios - high-tech gadgets that time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of airplanes, but they also developed and approved by the FAA, as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines offer passengers Wi-Fi at a cruising altitude for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi-systems, which are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals a much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals scroll through the pages.
But the signals become more powerful when the device upload or send data.
Among those who sought to ease the restrictions on the use of passengers electronic devices, the company was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company representatives have downloaded a airliner their devices for reading electronic books Kindle and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the Advisory Committee FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices is any risk.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers, said that he considered interference from devices real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there are only individual messages pilots, confirming that the devices can cause interference with aircraft systems, and most of these messages are very old.
Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that the FAA allowed pilots require passengers off the device while planting the devices in conditions of limited visibility.
A group of representatives of tourist industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers, which now use a variety of technological devices.
«We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of the passengers is not incompatible with security and protection,» said Roger Dow, General Director of the Tourist Association of the United States.

Information about it is published on the portal DELFI.
According to the report, in particular Moscow intends to "negotiate" the President of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian state archives relating to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to special services, preparation of informational attack leads the Department of analysis of social processes of the Russian presidential administration for interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
Structure is headed by Evgeny Умеренков, not time visiting Lithuania and took part in the Congress of the Lithuanian people's party.
Also a party to the transaction is allegedly a member of the Department Century Smirnov.
As claimed by the secret service, Smirnov under the guise of scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov denied entry to the country.

New антиникотиновая vaccine may deprive the process of Smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed антиникотиновую vaccine, which could deprive the process of Smoking cigarettes pleasure.
One dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests before the start of the trials, which will take several years, but the Professor Ronald Crystal of the medical College Уэйлл Cornell in new York said that the first results are encouraging.
«We hope this strategy for the use of the vaccine could finally help the millions of smokers who try to quit, having tried all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern means,» said Professor at Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was designed to carry genetic information for the production of антиникотиновых antibodies.
Virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies stalk any molecule of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the obtaining of a smoker nicotine kick.
In tests vaccinated mice that later gave nicotine, continued their normal activity.
But mice that were not given the vaccine, «relax», and this is a sign that nicotine reaches their brain, say the researchers.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccine failed, because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections should have done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns the liver cells in the factories of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used smokers to quit Smoking.
«They know that if they are to start Smoking again, will not give them this pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit,» he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research is needed.

Frontier Airlines will charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers to $100 for what they are carrying hand Luggage on Board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep all of the Bank.
The new fee for hand Luggage cover bags in the upper baggage compartments, so small bags placed under a seat, will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25, if the fee is payable in advance and $100, if travelers will pay only once at the gate.
The representative of the Frontier Kate O'malley said that the fee of $100 must make the passengers to take care about paying in advance.
«We do not want to charge for it,» she said.
Airlines have started to charge for the first and second bag, delivered as a baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees, fill as many could, in your hand Luggage placed in overhead storage compartments, which in these compartments often not enough space.
Fees - one of the ways to make passengers carry less on Board.
O'malley said that this new collection is not really for the sake of making money.
The fact is that most loyal customers Frontier claim that find a place in the top Luggage compartment becomes more and more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website, will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the exit for the flight Frontier may get the opportunity to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'malley said that the change of procedures in the website and check-in counter Frontier is designed to ensure that passengers will know about collecting before they get to the departure gate.
New collection Frontier for carry-on baggage will not be charged until the summer, though the date has not been established.
Passengers often complain about the fees for checked bags and other charges, but the airline their love.
They argue that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many on wall street consider adding baggage charges sign that the airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.
However, most of them related to fees for carry-on baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for carry-three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with such collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the consultant said on airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the incremental fees.
By his assessment the report of December 2011, the fee for hand baggage brings the Spirit $50 million per year.
Sorensen, former top-Manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew the flight of the Spirit, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, when passengers will face an unusual collection of Spirit for carry-on baggage.
«The process of planting was the smooth that I've seen in my career in the airline,» he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth, and the emergence of a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, «and landing has passed rapidly.»
Frontier also follows the Spirit to paying $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice can keep the whole Bank and that topping coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will still be free to distribute the water.
US Airways short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned it after seven months, after the passengers started to complain and no other largest airline had not followed her example.
Initiative Frontier to charge fees for carry-on baggage when passengers buy tickets directly from the airline's latest measure to attract customers to your web site.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines incentive to encourage passengers can buy tickets directly from them, rather than contact the online travel Agency.
However Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she started giving two times less award miles frequent flyer card customers who have purchased tickets through an online travel Agency.
On Wednesday she cut the number of premium miles to 25 per cent of miles of travel.
So, the journey of 1000 miles from the Frontier, purchased from online travel Agency, would get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets on the website of the Frontier.
The Frontier have a base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but its business is reduced and becomes unprofitable.
Revenue declined 9 percent, and flight capabilities have been reduced by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday parent company of Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tries to correct the Finance Frontier in the framework of the sale of the airline.

Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now for the news from across the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel struck missiles for Russian production, which reportedly intended to Hezbollah.
Today Syria has fulfilled important condition - destroy to November 1, the production of chemical weapons.
This was done in the framework of the agreement reached through the mediation of Russia and made US not to undertake a military operation, to which they came close this summer.
Read more about guns and what it all means to the Syrian President, tell our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August from poison gas.
And punishment come.
But not in the form of American bombing campaign, but in the form of the transaction, which made each of Assad Vladimir Putin.
Syria abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria has put out of action declared a factory for the production of chemical weapons.
More long-term and difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand, this is about a thousand tons.
Earlier Washington said that the days of the Assad regime are numbered.
I think Assad must go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it happens.
It is no longer legitimate and should quit.
But Assad remains.
And feels more confident.
His troops still use artillery, missiles and Napalm.
His opponents fragmented and poorly armed.
His people forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
Agreement on chemical weapons referred to as the success of diplomacy, inspectors awarded the Nobel peace prize, and the Assad made an impression of a man ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. Ambassador to Syria had to answer the tough questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother hardly easier because its not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad still holds.
And changes weapons power.

Parents интерсексуальных children can choose «indefinite floor»
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third floor in babies born to women with external genital organs of the intermediate type.
Newborns will not necessarily ascribe male or female.
The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as «indefinite» or «unspecified» in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from the parents, who can take a hasty decision about surgery for assigned sex newborn, and counteract discrimination intersex people from happening.
One интерсексуальный people, according to the BBC, said many years later: «I not a man and a woman».
I'll stay doctors created a patchwork product with bruises and scars.
Approximately one out of two thousand children born each year, is neither boy nor girl.
They интерсексуальность, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of «disturbance of sexual development» - an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, гонадами (ovaries or testes) or unusual developed outer sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been интерсексуалом.
Gender identity, has until now not been studied, but most experts in the United States say that if Paul could not be determined, it is better to use all the available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child prior to the operation, if ever, happens.
New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, which specializes in the issues of gender identification, said that the new German law sounds like a good idea».
Интерсексуальные children create ethical dilemma.
«Some people have life-threatening disorders, which require surgical intervention, however, most children do not have them,» he said.
You can assign the floor without surgery and then see how it develops personality.
The science of how the child develops any gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It is like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people from happening as different from transsexual or transgender, as their condition is not related to gender, and to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively neither male nor female, and is typical for both at the same time or not characteristic for any one of them.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary sex characteristics, such as muscle mass distribution of hair on the chest and body shape; primary sex characteristics, such as the reproductive organs and the genitals or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview about the discrimination faced by интерсексуальные and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of oppression, cruelty and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Boys with gender deviations now there is a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allow adults to put a male, female or «third sex» in its official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia norri may-Welby became the first man in the world, recognized as «asexual», defended in court the right to the preservation of «undefined» sex status for life.
According to the Ministry of internal Affairs, the German passports will be used third designation in addition to the M and F - X, that is интерсексуальный.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still causing contradictions, according to a news release on channel France 24.
In 2011 dozens of lawmakers from France, this pronounced Catholic country, signed a petition for withdrawal of the «gender theory» from school textbooks.
American web site Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that «in a situation where the world is drawn into the new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity no, we are turning the two pillars of civilization».
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also reported the web-site Baby Zone, that she would prefer that children have established a floor at birth.
«Raising a child is hard enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,» she said web site for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sex organs, called гермафродитами - on behalf of the beautiful Greek God, who possessed the characteristics of both sexes.
And even just ten years ago, the medical community perceptions of gender as a sheet, which can all be erased, and then draw again.
But now many challenge the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and the doctor will sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive assigned floor when he grows up.
«In the middle of the XX century it was called "urgent psychiatric case,» said Drescher.
When such children were born, you were calling not a psychiatrist - you called a surgeon.
The predominant theory about how to treat children with the genitals intermediate type was proposed by Dr. John Mani from the Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easy to change.
He coined the term «gender identity» and argued that environmental signals, including social - how parents raise their child, interact with genes and hormones child, determining whether people consider themselves as male or female.
But in one case, 1966, known as «John/Joan», his theories were in question.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during negligent circumcision, completely neutered child, removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
«Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not so», - said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he was again the boy and married a woman.
But at the age of 38 he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors still use this model».
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who have experienced these sex change surgery, have declared themselves «unhappy outcome.»
Such was also the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but genitals intermediate type.
Doctors could not accurately determine whether there was it a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never have a «full life» men.
Therefore, soon after his birth in 1976 external penis and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to give a female hormones at the age of 12 years.
«I knew that I'm not a girl,» he said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
In the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something's wrong, he required medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilised at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with the violation of sexual development which did not give his body to produce sufficient testosterone for normal development of the genitals.
Having learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving testosterone injections and removing their chest.
Operation made it unfruitful.
Today it advocates in other organization under the name of the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Anne Тэмар-Mattis, Executive Director of the California law Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law encourages earning shortcuts and stigma».
«Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and to give the child "indefinite floor,» she said.
We fear that he will contribute to the intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign male or female, and then wait.
But we have not seen how to show itself this law, so all we can do is speculate.
Тэмар-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law, because «it allows adults to people to make a choice in favor of a third sex.»
«Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,» she says.
German law implies its assignment at birth.
This battle, in which young children should not join at this stage.
When they grow up, they can then make decisions regarding her own body.
But Dr. Arlene Barats, mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh who had a daughter with violation of sexual development and that helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law will «support» both parents and children.
Daughter Barats, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but it has a disturbance in sexual development called «syndrome complete insensitivity to actually androgen».
Since its androgen receptors work correctly, Kathy developed women's signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Kathy is married and goes residency training in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she was barren, she hopes to become a parent by adoption or gestational surrogacy.
«The law gives parents time to not to make hasty decisions for themselves,» said Barats.
It gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they write «male» or «female».
In this case, you're right - raise a child, like a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need haste to do the operation, which is irreversible.
«It allows children to participate in the decision and addresses the excitement that motivates parents, because they do not feel they are doing the right thing,» she said.
Eventually the child will decide what Paul him or her more comfortable, and it is splendid.
It gives children the opportunity to decide for themselves.

The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of «stop-and-search» in the new York police Department
On Thursday the court of appeal of the Federal district has suspended the execution of a judgment requiring changes in the program «stop-and-frisk» new York police Department, and dismissed judge of the case.
The court of appeals for the second circuit U.S. stated that decisions of the judges Ширы Шейндлин will be suspended until the results of the appeal lodged city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution, as he carried out a program for street detention and interrogation.
The city appealed the decision of the resolution of corrective action, including prescription assign controller to help police station to change practices and the related training programme.
On Thursday the court of appeals heard oral arguments on a motion to suspend the case.
The appeals court stated the need for disqualification of a judge due to the fact that it violated the code of conduct for judges of the U.S. and ignored the need to avoid demonstration of bias, partly due to a series of interviews in the media and official statements of public response to criticism of the court.
The judge decided that the police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people arbitrarily referring to blacks and латиноамериканцам program «stop-and-frisk».
It has appointed an external controller for the oversight of important developments, which include reform policies, training and monitoring, and decided to launch a pilot program for testing fixed by a body of cameras in those police stations, where most arrests.
In August new York came to the decision to stop the practice of storing names and addresses of people, the works on which were terminated after police checks.
The debate on the appeal of the city must be held after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of «stop and search» criticised by many advocates for civil rights.
«Stop search» practiced for decades in one form or another, however, the number of documented stops increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching in 2011 absolute record in 684 330 people, mostly blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four people, all members of ethnic minorities, filed in court class action lawsuit.
Supporters of changes in the program «stop-and-search» in the new York police Department said that these changes will put an end to unfair practice, will form a more reliable and effective police service and can affect how other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money will not solve the more global problem of challenging conditions in the police due to reducing the number of officers on several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that it does not stop the practice of «stop-and-frisk», which corresponds to the Constitution, however, changes the way the new York police stops people.

Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse of the prices of the goods after the signing of Association with the EU
Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will be reduced significantly after the country will sign the Association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this in the course of communication with the readers of your page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by many factors, among which are, including customs payments.
Now, after signing the agreement and the entry into force of the FTA provisions, the level of customs duties on imports from the EU will be reduced significantly.
And this will mean that prices should be reduced.
"It is with regard to goods that come from the EU countries", - wrote Azarov.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices is not so direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there should not be a rise in prices.
Therefore, messages on billboards, which in recent years much has appeared in our country, that the Association with the EU is the rise in prices, that is not true, or to be more precise - is not so", - Azarov summed up.

Rescue package in the amount of $325 million for health care Tasmania
The Federal government insists that the rescue package in the amount of $325 million to a weakened health system Tasmania will be supplemented with strict conditions that ensure that the state government does not spend their money wasted.
Federal Minister of health Tanya Плиберсек announced that the Commonwealth accepts «urgent measures»to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state, higher levels of chronic disease and the limitations of the system.
A decision of financing within a period of four years was made after consultations of the government with independent Deputy Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.
«The government has proposed a package of emergency measures, which, we believe, will solve the specific problems facing the state», said Ms. Плиберсек.
Package size $325 million includes $31 million blitz campaign on planned operations.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract operations, will help close the gap.
There is also money for clinics accepting patients without an appointment, in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after hospital, the training of medical specialists, mental health services and introduction of systems of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals.
«These investments will expressed by the best doctors realization of ideas about how best to help the health care system of Tasmania», - said Ms. Плиберсек.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian government will work in a mode of accountability and responsibility.
Staff will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive the funds of the Commonwealth, and monthly report about where he spends these additional funds.
It will be a Commission of three persons, to ensure that the staff provides services efficiently and effectively.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will not provide a solution, «if not to be followed by a genuine reform that will put the health system Tasmania on a more sustainable basis».
However, he praised the government for its response to its request for emergency assistance, which he first turned to the Prime Minister in early may.
«I hope that the package of Federal aid will contribute significantly to the conclusion of the system of health in the state of critical state», - said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional sampling largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the Federal opposition representative of health Peter Dutton thinks that the present Declaration is a «solution similar to лейкопластырю».
«The reason we are here is that the labour government of the state vomited $430 million from the health care system,» he said on ABC TV.
When the state of tears off nearly half a billion dollars, and Commonwealth invests 300 million, you cannot pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Плиберсек ensure that no one dollar rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.

A cry of despair voter Obama
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope for the possibility of change
He says that Obama has allowed обструкционизму Republicans negate the commendable efforts.
Obstructionism can't justify the problems with the web site of the reformed Obama's health care system, drones attack
Memoirs about the Obama campaign 2008 are a sad reminder of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris a second - year student of medical faculty of Harvard University.
I read terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book will inspire me in times of discouragement on the second year of the medical faculty and revive in me a sense of hope.
It's called «the Audacity to win», and it is a memoir about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama 2008.
In the evening when I am writing the reports of my patients and I go to bed, this book takes me back to the time when the policy has inspired millions of people, and the presentations could capture the spirit.
The victory at the elections was impressive, and conducting of the programs pause for reflection of this historic moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents took care of all the Newspapers, which only they could find.
The White house had to come a young team of strategists, and people were ready for change.
At the time of entry Obama in office in 2008, the level of support amounted to 82 %.
Then I close the book.
Return currently represents a rude awakening as pulling out of the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism, they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of the missed opportunities.
In the years since then, as I lowered my first ballot, changes have indeed occurred.
It was something that I could not even imagine.
I give Obama credit for its large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on accessible medical aid until the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the abolition of the rule «don't ask, don't tell»killing Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that the party obstructionism blocked too many attempts to move this country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health care and to close the base in Guantanamo, among others.
But after countless times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I ran explanation that I can provide.
I had reached the point of political desperation.
Obstructionism Republicans can't explain authorization to wiretap foreign leaders or unmanned aircraft strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It can't explain the collection of information about the private lives of Americans by the national security Agency or prosecution whistleblowers that reveal the unlawful actions of the government.
It can't explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or failure to comply with the limits of public funding and expenses during the presidential campaign.
He can't justify the findings of the report, which States that applied the White house effort to silence the media, are «the most aggressive, since the days of the Nixon administration».
And lately he can't justify what you cannot develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable healthcare.
Don't know that I would expect.
Whether I was at the age of 18 years to understand that leadership may be contrary to political campaigns, which precede him?
Clearly, the work of the elected office is not predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and such random events like the massacre in Newtown.
However, in all the above-mentioned examples can be seen that they were greatly own choices administration.
And that is what bothers me the most.
Again I voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm about his candidacy.
MITT Romney was a strange and rough alternative, he seemed unable to take a decision on its own policy or views.
I thought that in his second term Obama, freed from the pressure of the upcoming elections, will justify the hopes that we have heard for such a long time.
However, when this week Obama's rating fell below 45 %, return in 2008 this book will become much more difficult.
It makes me yearn for many promises, which vanished.
This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton struck Obama deafening defeat in the primary election in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting on the analysis of the reasons of failure he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain true to their goal.
«I want we returned to our appeal, " he said.
- We must remember who we are.»
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
Expressed in this commentary opinions belong exclusively Натаниэлю Morris.

In Egypt accepts the oath of the first freely elected President
Mohammed Mursi taking the oath, but the day of his triumph hardly would mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised «a new Egypt», when brought the oath of office, becoming the first freely elected President, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted by 16 months ago.
At his inauguration in front of the Supreme constitutional court Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist President of the Arab world and the fifth head of the state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy over 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges in black robes in the court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of ancient Egyptian temple.
«We aspire to a better future, new Egypt and the second Republic,» said Mursi, during a ceremony shown live on state television.
«Today the Egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life of absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability», - said Mursi, 60-year old engineer with the American education from the Muslim brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that most of 84 years of its existence has been banned organization, which served as a target for tough actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police, when Mursi arrived with a small tuple shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court, to welcome the new President, and, unlike the presidential pump times Mubarak, traffic was stopped only briefly to skip his motorcade on the normally busy road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi derided as нехаризматичное «spare tire «Brothers», his personal prestige has grown dramatically since its victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who want to bring to the end the uprising 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
«Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern country», - said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges, wood-panelled hall, where he took the oath.
Later Mursi went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.

The exam will also feature «extracurricular texts»to encourage a more extensive reading.

Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours a week during the quarter)than in most countries.
For comparison - Australian schools give on the average 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students engage in approximately 138 hours.

Football is the cause of discord?
In the state Duma within the framework of the "Open tribune" politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals sounded something like: disable football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - some scandals and strife.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin reminded about the recent events in Бирюлеве and said that to reduce the "degree of tension in the society, politicians and the media must be correct in his statements.
Perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, which is one of the television threatened to surround the Caucasus barbed wire, if they don't want to limit the birth rate...
All the speakers spoke about measures on the regulation of migration from the CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which made the discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoryev said that the events in Бирюлеве - "model a conflict that could predict", but "for these questions we have answers too many people and institutions, and too many cooks spoil the broth.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time against migrants practiced Europe, according to the social worker, failed, and we must search for its own path.
Historian Yury Petrov laid great hopes on the new single history textbook.
"Still it is necessary to create a textbook on the history and culture of the peoples of the country, to students in Tatarstan knew that for people living in Dagestan, and Vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov suggested introducing criminal liability for "calling for the dismemberment of Russia": "If the U.S. say on the radio that we should give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and will give 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to kindle".
As usual, in all things he accused the journalists who advise patients and acute national problems on the public discussion: "In the heat of controversy whether a little that can be said!"
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to sign a Charter and agree to talk on this subject carefully, and then these same commitments can take over and policy.
We adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the procedure set, said Mr. Vasilyev.
He gave the example of a law that imposes on the regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace in their territory.
But Lyudmila Андриченко delight about this law are not shared: it is not clear ideas about what the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and limits.
Therefore, entities will be interpreted differently scope of these powers.
Besides, governments do not have the skills necessary to address such complex issues, no money, and methodical recommendations, which they could use, center does not...
The head of the Duma Committee on nationalities Гаджимет Safaraliyev proposed to create a special office with a terrible name "the Ministry of national security," which dealt with questions of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s led the equivalent office, упраздненное subsequently, spoke out against it.
It is enough to have at the Federal level, a special person, "Minister without portfolio, to be addressed, if that.
"We're walking on the edge, shells burst next, very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions act together against the provocations and this work should receive an adequate informational support", - said the representative of Russian Orthodox Church for relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin.
No neutrality of the state in respect of dangerous ideologies, religious including, be, in his opinion, should not.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected direction: "more and More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, look still necessary, but they are pushing the wrong way, not on that road," he said.
"Not the way" is the development of football: "The player beaten the whole crowd, the flags of the loom, comrades stones each other's throw...
Maybe we don't need this football?
There is another kind of sport - Rugby is called...
"They will not be equal in the world in this sport!" hotly, said справоросс.
Rugby in the Caucasus no one to play! - immediately intervened Mr. Zhirinovsky.
You still Curling offer them!
You should know the national peculiarities, it is a Georgian "Zaporozhets" offer"...
In Yaroslavl wild behaviour distinguished representatives of the Moscow club during the game with the local club.
Football will have to prohibit all over the country...

Recognition of the national security Agency reinforce the paranoia of corporations to state surveillance
Warm afternoon in late August, the German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal service for the protection of the Constitution (BfV), the internal intelligence service of Germany, his job was to take a photograph of the roof of a building of representation of the United States, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say BfV hoped to discover antenna listening devices, and these actions led to the negotiations between the USA and the Ministry of foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of National intelligence of the USA, in September again assured, that the USA do not use the possibility of foreign intelligence for the theft of commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their profit».
But since Edward Snowden - contract employee, who became the unmasker - began to publish his treasure secrets intelligence of the USA, European governments and CEOs are no longer sure whether to trust the Director General of the word.
Reports that the National security Agency USA followed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, and has access to the data stored in the cloud provider in the USA, including Google and Yahoo, raised paranoia corporations, caused by the surveillance state, to new heights.
The last straw was the news that the telephone Chancellor Angela Merkel was listened to, maybe about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe may become a target, then, of course, potential targets are and business leaders.
Snowden has made evident the intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the USA and companies.
I think it quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
«Germany must Wake up,» said Oliver Грюн, President of the Association BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and theft of data, according to a study published in July consulting Agency EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Сноуденом, however, there was still no evidence that the United States passed the commercial secrets of the foreign companies in their own companies.
Politicians expressed their concern that the EU lacks the specific capabilities in the field of information technologies and the Internet, and suggested that he should try to reduce their dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly opened them again...
«This is not an option,» says Гассо Plattner, the President of German company-provider of business software SAP.
If there is need of a powerful European IT industry shouldn't have let her die more than 20 years ago.
All subsidized in Germany: from coal to hire and farmers.
All, apart from the IT-industry.
Nevertheless, coverage and technical development agencies espionage USA, which became known through revelation Сноудена were a shock for some companies that used to be thought that the biggest risk to the surveillance of China.
Big shift happens in the cloud technologies, where the leaders of European companies to better realize that the data stored in the United States, are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to research from the trade Association of the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants have abandoned plans to use the services headquartered in the USA cloud provider after the exposure of the American program for the mining Prism.
Jim Снейб, one of the Executive Directors of the SAP, said: «We see that consumers ask a new question that arose a year ago, namely: where is my data and can you guarantee that they are physically remain in this jurisdiction».
Many German authorities say that the last message is just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets and, therefore, these data must be protected at any cost.
What happens economic espionage, is not surprising.
He always had a place.
«It was a subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,» said Kurt Bock, chief Executive officer of the chemical company BASF.
Americans spying on us the commercial and industrial level, and we are also for them spy, because it is in our national interests to defend our businesses.
Leaders of corporations usually do not like to brag about the response that they have taken, as this may provide an advantage to the enemy.
In large companies has long been internalized the idea that free flash exhibition or keep the laptop unattended in the room of the hotel is, at least, imprudent.
Ulrich Хакенберг, member of the Board of Directors automaker Audi, said that for many years it is standard practice is to collect mobile phones before the Board meetings so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The Federal service for the protection of the German Constitution recommends heads of companies consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips vulnerability in smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones subsequently released.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to break-ins and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leaders of the world market in their particular niche.
«Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience of staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access», warns the report BfV.
The United States warned its own companies on economic espionage from other countries.
The national intelligence summary of the USA in February has placed France, together with Russia and Israel in the second number of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
Member of the Board of Directors of prestigious German company confirmed that when speaking about the economic espionage, «the French people are worse than others.»
Bernard Скарсини, former head of the French domestic intelligence Agency DCRI reportedly stated in an interview this month: «The well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spying on its allies».

«Whether the question discussed during the telephone conversations, the question of the development policy of the commercial lease?» - asked the assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley Mr. Триподи.
«No,» answered Mr. Триподи. -
I can't remember what was discussed, but it is certainly wasn't it.

«This is a dreadful place, and there is reason to question: what can prevent the destruction of the Parliament, the independence of the judicial system in the future?» - the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
«This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,» said Cyrus Kamau, managing Director of Capital Group - the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected in Kenya independent radio stations and news site.
He said that a new judicial body on mass media «will always be biased, because it is a continuation of the government», and restrict content and advertising will harm the position of Kenya in the global economy.
«I hope that the President will listen to us, and we turn to him with a request to reject the bill and return it to deputies,» he said.
According to the newspaper, The Star, the new law essentially allow the government to «take media stranglehold», and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya «received a serious blow,» and criticized the draft law as «draconian».
The adoption of the draft law is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attacks by Muslim terrorists in the Westgate shopping centre.

After accusing дурновкусии Eugenia Vasilieva started talking
Eugenia Vasilieva, to the person which almost a year riveted the attention of the media, so far has never commented on numerous publications in the press as the embezzlement in the defense Ministry, and about her personally - relations with the ex-defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, its poetry and Amateur of the valuable things.
However, on 1 November defendant in the case "Oboronservis" broke the silence.
In an interview to the " Life News " Vasiliev said: "Initially, of course, the problem was exactly the same: pull out of me any negative information concerning the former defense Minister".
Was blackmail on the subject that I have to give evidence, otherwise I go to jail.
To date, these threats stopped.
Further we go to court, we shall prove his innocence.
We are confident in the victory of 100 percent.
In this interview, we can conclude that, perhaps, the most Vasiliev touched words that she no matter tastefully.
Probably referring to the statement of the official representative of the UK Vladimir Markin that the collection of paintings which collected the defendant in the case "Oboronservis", was a forgery.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings, which the housewife, being confident in their deeper understanding of art, acquired as masterpieces of the world painting.
However, the art expertise, appointed by investigators after his arrest these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap imitations", - Markin noted in the beginning of October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of defence...
Then admitted that they were from the Ministry of defense is not stolen, and told me that I have bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some private moments?
I think it's just a mess," says Vasilyev.
On asked if she guilt least one of 12 charges against her criminal episodes, Vasilyev said: "of Course not.
Admit nothing.
Moreover, there is no harm of the Russian Federation in question.
Just enter a nation astray, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the RF IC that Vasilyev evades studying the materials of the criminal case, the advocate a specific extra said that he and his client "the investigator does not give acquainted with the materials of the case".
That was the reason to revelations under house arrest Vasilyeva, still not общавшейся with the press?
Perhaps, as a woman she could not reply to the charge in poor taste?
Or right journalists of "Komsomolskaya Pravda", who claimed a couple of days ago that she fell into a trance under house arrest, because of the news about reconciliation Anatoly Serdyukov and his wife and his return to the bosom of her family?
Famous military observer of the "KP" Viktor Baranets in his article, "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "Investigators do not exclude, that after such a shock, it can become more talkative during interrogations".
Previously Vasiliev some of the accusations in illegal sale of immovable property of the Ministry of defense undertook.

For those coming near (say, in Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars to pay 15 thousand rubles (3800 UAH) and the passing.
And the rest are stuck because no one so much money with you!
Imagine if the driver carries cargo to the amount of four thousand dollars, but back in Moscow, he needs to 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand UAH) to pay for transit!
The conditions for their survival on the border - no - complaining about truckers have a near their vehicles.

The Agency "Rosbalt" has been deprived of the status of the media for swearing
October 31, the Moscow city court ruled to invalidate the license of the registration Agency "Rosbalt", - writes the "Ribbon".
The deprivation of the Agency the status of the media insisted Roskomnadzor for systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media.
In the course of the process was a very unfortunate precedent: the court considered it possible to close down the media, actually denying the publication of the right to put forward counter-arguments.
What is the "Rosbalt"
CJSC "Information Agency Rosbalt" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the Agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional offices.
Also the Agency has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, the "Rosbalt" was developed and functioned as a Federal information-analytical Agency.
By mid-2000s, the Agency included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.
The "Rosbalt" has always held a very specific niche: the core of the exclusive Agency publications were (and are still) notes referring to sources in law enforcement bodies.
Talk about the proximity of the edition to the security forces continued throughout the existence of the Agency.
Along with the fact that "Rosbalt" had an extensive base of sources in different departments, in favour of such assumptions spoke and that the head of the project there was Natalia Chaplin - wife of Victor Cherkesov.
The role of Чаплиной guide Росбалтом" unclear: most often it is called the "project Manager".
General Director of the Agency is Larisa Afonina, chief editor, Nikolai Ulyanov.
In the last time "Rosbalt" did not appear in the rankings of the Federal mass media - not for citation, nor on the audience.
In October, the Agency took 25th place in the rating of the sites attendance Russian media version LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials for the last five months - notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of group "the King and the jester", the riots in the capital Бирюлеве.
The conflict of "Rosbalt" with Roscomnadzor began in July 2013, when the amendments to the media law, which prohibited the journalists foul language.
The office found a prohibited vocabulary two published on the Agency website videos ("Dzhigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiled oil derricks").
Further, the parties describe different.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of identified videos accused the "Rosbalt" in the gross and systematic violation of the law on mass media and addressed the court demanding to deprive the Agency of the license.
In "Росбалте argued that the claims office is unwarranted: first, rollers were not editorial materials, secondly, abusive words in them were masked, and, thirdly, right, after warning the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the Agency challenged the claims of Roscomnadzor arbitration court and when 22 October 2013 Moscow city court accepted a claim of Roscomnadzor, consideration of these complaints still continued.
However, already the 25th day of the magistrate judge issued a decision not in favor of "Rosbalt": chief editor Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the administrative code and fined on 20 thousand roubles - on 10 thousand for each movie.
Obviously, it has predetermined the outcome of the hearing at the Moscow city court - if abandon the idea that the outcome could be a foregone conclusion even before.
on October 31 the court decided to annul the certificate of registration of "Rosbalt", effectively eliminating the Agency the status of the media.
Not to say that the "Rosbalt" in the course of this conflict remained alone.
The Agency was supported by the deputies of the state Duma (an application addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov 10 October signed by 26 deputies; the document was submitted on the initiative of the Communist party).
On the illegality of the closure of the periodical stated the head of the Union of journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, Chairman of the Moscow Union of journalists Pavel Gusev, the head of the presidential human rights Council Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Mr. Bogdanov, manual Roscomnadzor even gave him some assurance that the revocation of the license will not come.
Trial over "Росбалтом" revealed: under whose jurisdiction a bit safer mass media in Russia today is a big question.

Gene speech was a stimulator of the formation of synapses
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University Medical school, mount Sinai discovered protein, thanks to which "gene speech" Foxp2 carries out the function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
A study published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read the summary.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome, the function of which is directly linked to the speech.
Install it the role of managed in 2001 due to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes do not understand each other.
Scientists have found that the family members were violated Foxp2 gene, but the way he performs his function, was not known.
In the new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulator of formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with the formation of speech.
Does this he thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered in the result of the search for the factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, only to his activity вияет Foxp2.
What SRPX2 really affect vocalization, scientists confirmed in experiment on мышатах.
When the animal gene activity was artificially reduced, they are less shouted at separation from the mother.
If the activity of a gene restored, reconstructed and the frequency of their calls.
Earlier on mice also shows the link with вокализацией the Foxp2.
Animals injected with human gene, squeaking faster and at a lower rate than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work Foxp2 and, accordingly, they managed SRPX2 with purely mechanical properties of education of sounds or of the more subtle processes.

Want glowing in the dark ice cream?
British entrepreneur created the first in the world glowing in the darkness ice cream with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of marine animals to develop a glowing food.
He got the idea after reading a research paper about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China chemically recreate fluorescent protein.
Ice cream reacts with the language of him who eats, increasing the pH level in the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that because the ice cream begins to glow when reacts to the heat of the mouth, this means that the more you лижете, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of production of ice cream "Лизни me, I vkusnoe", says: «This is an incredible thing, but still at a very early stage, if we talk about production, so for sleeping and 200, you get about 2 g of substance».
A protein that we use in ice cream, reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth is warm protein, it will raise the pH level and ice cream will begin to glow.
We tested it during the last few months, and it seemed that the ideal is to submit it at Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice-cream that I did, because luminescence jellyfish four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me around GBP 140.
But it is quite a pleasant taste.
Experimental Charlie company, located in Bristol, famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of gold leaf.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said: «I really want to develop the invisible ice cream.»
It is impossible by definition due to the refraction caused by ice crystals, which is an ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of Medusa, synthesized by Chinese scientists

The EU is working on measures of support of Ukraine in case of economic pressure of Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, and also on achievement of the arrangement with the IMF for an emergency loan, if Russia will take any measures in response to the possible signing of an Association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
With the IMF negotiations concerning the credit stand-by and the other EU official directly involved in the negotiations, and added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In this case besides the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine may get 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome the long-standing differences on terms of financing.
Do not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary for assistance, and the international rating Agency S&P, понизившее on Friday Ukraine's sovereign rating by one notch to ' b - ' from ' b'.
However, EU officials say that the IMF could be flexible loan terms, taking into account the circumstances of the Ukraine.
In addition to the plan of financial support from European Union has a backup option for providing gas to Ukraine, the majority of whose supply now comes from Russia.

"Between EU and Ukrainian negotiations on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, and not from Russia, or from the same source, but by other routes," the source added Reuters.

Italian workers with the experience of giving way to young
Italian unemployment rate hits record.
Data released on Wednesday showed that without work now 12,5% of the population.
So bad case it since the Second world war.
Among young this figure is several times higher.
40,4% of the population aged 15 to 24 years of age have no employment.
In the opinion of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem - early retirement of older workers.
Such экперимент already holds the largest power company of the country, while the adopted laws allow the regional authorities provide some early pension for employees with experience.
However, on the other hand, Italy is waiting for the General to the aging population of Europe.
And economists are not sure that the idea of premature staff rotation will justify itself.

Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria destroyed all the capacity for the production of chemical weapons, recognized the Organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons.
This first phase of the disarmament Damascus completed the day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria was to destroy the production and any other helper objects intended for preparation of chemical warfare agents for use, reports the BBC.
The destruction of themselves stocks of toxic chemicals or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, currently toxic substances are sealed vaults.
International inspectors went to Syria after being on the outskirts of Damascus, August 21, during a chemical attack killed, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people.
The main task of the inspectors was no time to lose - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more of chemical weapons and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipment ammunition.
These production facilities will now be carefully monitored to prevent their fix.
Next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
The questions here a lot.
Where they will be disposed of?
Who will provide the equipment for it?
All Syrian applications will be carefully reviewed by Western intelligence agencies.
They readily advise inspectors new objects to check, if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus until the end of candid.
The United States believes that this bombardment was conducted by the regular armed forces.
Syria and Russia insist that it was the work of insurgents.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached through the mediation of Russia, is to kill or cause outside the state of all power for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids, and filling of the shells of these substances.
Now, when this step is completed, the next step must be the destruction of the existing Syrian army chemical weapons.
It is expected that in the Arsenal can be more than 1000 tons of neuro-paralytic agents, skin-blister agents mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
Its destruction is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to start coordinated action timing is two weeks.
Director of field operations OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally oversaw the destruction of the equipment".
"They now there is no possibility to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.
In a statement by the OPCW provides that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 sites in Syria and were convinced that the plants for the production of shells and toxic substances destroyed or are in disrepair.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out the inspection, the document says, but the equipment was transported from there and checked by the specialists of the OPCW.
According to Smith, the destruction of infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "particularly difficult", as had to work in conditions of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel peace prize, however, according to Smith, the time to celebrate this inspectors until found - they were too busy.

George Кереван: the gap with Europe gives the Scots choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
Comes stories about the passport control at Berwick and the border with barbed wire along the Адрианова shaft.
However, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of a free movement in the rest of Europe, though - which, predictably, it does not appear in the headers.
Nor do they pointed out that the EU member States spend a lot of time to turn our formal rules as it suits them.
Because Scotland is now not part of the Schengen zone, continued non-compliance is becoming cheap concession to Brussels instead of what he really wanted from the Scots.
So this is not a worthwhile story.
And so old that it has turned into a fossil: the first time I heard the «hoax» that «independence means passport control»at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the process of paraphrasing the old tales.
Why do independent Scotland must obeyed orders of Europe?
Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally has stalled.
With еврокризисом project «Europe» is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union of parties opposed to the EU or for the cancellation of the Euro as a common currency, trying to force.
Even in Germany the party sceptics «Alternative for Germany - based only this year - it came out of nowhere and got almost five million votes in the September Federal elections, thus essentially pushing the «Free Democrats» (similar to our «Liberal Democrats») of the Bundestag.
Always there was the internal opposition to the plan to establish a Federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
Austerity measures introduced Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the fetters imposed on the national economy through the conservation of the single currency, have led many people to think that the project «Europe» gone too far.
Euro crisis is not connected with the fact that national governments are at excessive budget deficits, - this was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members on exchange rates, favorable for German exporters, - that German politicians and want to save.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency southern Europe is in a pre disadvantage production capabilities in comparison with Germany.
The only cure is to cut salaries and government spending that is actively supported by Berlin.
Because of the current problems of the budget and currency worth a deeper problem productive capacities of Europe.
As a result of complex measures for «green» energy, embedded Brussels - cipher, meaning the subsidizing of the French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more for gas than in the USA.
This парализующе adverse price conditions, as we have seen in Грейнджмуте.
No freezing of salaries in the world will not stop crushing victory cheap shale gas USA over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result of brewing revolt, especially in France, once the most ardent стороннице EU.
After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and already imposed their own economic policies of Europe, leaving a devastated economy of France in distress.
Result - right, anti-EU party marine Le Pen's national front, has just won a decisive election, throwing the ruling party of the socialists in the third place.
«Front» is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to the British incoming on that one cannot assume that the split among the right automatically affect in favor of the left.
What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among French white working class?
She wants to use the elections to the EU next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and the single currency.
If - and it is very probably anti-EU party will receive support in these elections, the unit will first take a dominant position in the European Parliament.
Here is my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and the single currency in Europe will unite together to destroy the Euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it would again become something of a vague «Europe (sovereign) Nations»that appealed to General de Gaulle.
Germany and a number of dependent economies can keep the Euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping closer ties with the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific ocean indicates the probability that the UK will remain without attention in the cold Atlantic.
In what position this leaves Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (essentially) Low England.
Or we can to protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland can succeed within a free European agreement provided that we will keep its currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier to нефедеральной Europe Nations.
Otherwise we should consider the possibility of repetition of the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence.
The government of the Scottish national party of Scotland is - strangely enough - the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against the austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 due to objections against cuts in expenditure proposed (and implemented) labour Chancellor of the exchequer Alastair Дарлингом and arisen subsequently coalition tories and liberal Democrats.
Scotland would be ridiculous to vote for independence only to take austerity measures imposed by the Berlin and Brussels.

Early puberty: the ageing of the earlier
African-American and Latino girls tend to enter puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty close
There is no evidence that the blame hormones or other chemicals
Experts believe that obesity can be one of the triggers early puberty
The trend to early sexual maturity is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pet Etheridge - journalist specializing on children's health and family matters.
Whether the mother scared if her daughter begin to form the beginnings of a breast and to grow pubic hair when I was 7 or 8 years?
Annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, a pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Капловитц explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among American girls, and they represent a new standard.
«I spend a lot of time, reassuring parents - usually this does not mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,» said Капловитц.
Obvious signs of development, such as the growing Breasts, pubic and axillary hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) during the last four decades.
In the United States the average age of 12.5 years and decreased in comparison with 12,75 in 1970.
«After the Breasts start to develop, runs at least two to three years before menarche,» said Капловитц, which is also an author of the book «Early puberty in girls: how to deal with this common problem».
Time - the most accurate test, as puberty progresses.
There is a discussion about what is the actual puberty, but deemed «premature», when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or suspended - is that a pediatrician can monitor carefully.
More rapid progression can serve as the basis for analyses by an endocrinologist, to eliminate the serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging bones, which may ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations on drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Капловитц careful with drugs, but acknowledges that «suppression of puberty may soften behavioral problems and sensation of girls that they are different from the other girls».
Another big problem is clear: parents just don't want to have them very young daughters were menstruation.
«They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they cope with the issues of hygiene,» said Капловитц.
«It was a shock», - says one woman, the daughter that menstruation began in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school a little scared and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many advertised theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that blame the hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the mass media.
Boys like girls - puberty occurs earlier.
Капловитц argues that premise, which has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls from 6 to 9 years, which links the amount of body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country of African-American and Latino girls tend to enter puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty, apparently affects everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys facial hair and pubic appear at a younger age, the trend toward complete early sexual maturation not so pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians participating in the conference of the AAP, confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair found even in infants and toddlers.
«We must be careful about how we define true puberty,» said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the children's hospital Гориеб in Morristown, new Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to take instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
«This may mean earlier than expected, the conversation», - explained Капловитц.
If you keep quiet, your child usually react well.
Girls who blossom early, need confirmation that even when this happens early, this process is a normal part of life.

These two trader will be the first employees of RBS, cut off during the unfolding of the investigation, which echoes with the scandal associated with the manipulation of interbank LIBOR rate.
Refusing to comment removal, the Bank confirmed that this month he received requests for information from the regulatory authorities.
«Our ongoing investigation of this issue is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators», - reported in the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month informed person said that RBS handed writing e-mail and instant messages that are received and sent his former trader, the regulatory authority UK - Management for control of financial activities (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, he was granted his current role as chief European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Рамчандани, head of the European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders was not accused of any wrongdoing.
Group im contact Mr. usher included bankers Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable persons.
UBS Bank said this week that he took action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said he is investigating the alleged manipulation of the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six of the regulatory bodies in the world - the European Commission, Finma, the antitrust authority Switzerland Weko, FCA, U.S. Department of justice and the Monetary authority of Hong Kong - examine allegations that bankers entered into a conspiracy to influence the foreign currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also internal audits began or received requests for information from regulators, said a person familiar with the situation.
Banks looking at instant messages and emails for a few years in search of offence cases.
News on inspections rocked traders in the field of activity, which in recent years one of the largest sources of income trading departments of investment banks, which, this year, however, faces challenges due to the fact that the low volatility of currencies reduces opportunities for Resellers.
Some bankers tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation, saying that the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market almost impossible to manipulate, but older traders said that it is not always true.
According to a senior trader, despite the huge amount of daily trading on the Forex market, fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and wider use of banks ' internal platforms means that «you can begin to make an impact on the market at very little cost».
This news comes on the same day, when the Bank Credit Suisse announced that fired one of the traders their Department's stock trades on the London stock exchange this week after he caused damages in the amount of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
«We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was managed to localize», - said Credit Suisse.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not late to go to bed and have a masquerade for our area.
Now I'm more like the скрягу.
I was not called in the past two years, handing out sweets in his apartment and, most likely, not going this year.
However, the statistics shows that I am a white crow in terms of Halloween.
According to the National retail Federation, the majority of Americans - namely 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting every Halloween is a trend.
National retail Federation predicts that the suits will take $1.2 billion of spent $6,9 billion
This year at the height of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Women won't necessarily be the representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, burgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we will see a lot of zombies thanks to the «Walking dead», and I'm sure the astronauts in the style of the band Daft Punk fall into our tapes Instagram this year.
According to Google, costumes, seeking more often, is a zombie, Batman, pirates, and witches.
Perhaps, there is nothing wrong with a traditional approach.
We furnished our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National retail Federation, Americans will spend this year and $330 million for costumes for Pets.
This means a lot of funny dog-hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we do not мелочимся.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It is about 600 million pounds Hershey chocolate, candies, candy, Milk Duds, chewing sweets Twizzlers and bars Clark Bar.
According to the Ministry of trade of the USA, this is good news for 41 million require candy children who were ready to conquer our regions.
Moreover, we will buy and - not deceive ourselves - that we may eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Association of confectioners, almost 35 million pounds sold under their Halloween.
It is about 9 billion individual corn seeds.
It's a mystery, which I have yet to unravel.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween, as haunted houses.
They stunning names, such as «Terror behind the walls» (which, incidentally, is in this prison), Howl and scream» and «House of shock».
Moreover, according to the company America Haunts, in America, there are 1200 officially recognized haunted houses, generating about $500 million in income, as well as the stunning pictures of you almost suddenly, that your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't get away, and then the guy that you like, sees the picture and leaves a comment like «cool face.»
And in conclusion let's talk about the pumpkins.
Charlie brown introduced us to the great Pumpkin, when we were children, and cut lamp Jack is like decorating the Christmas tree, what we do with childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for the child in the pumpkin started only last year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up, cutting these pumpkins, and not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. census Bureau, this year, Americans spend about $106 million on the pumpkin.
Jack light, slowly drying on your porch, probably arrived from Illinois, who grew this year 542 million pounds of pumpkin.

The owners of pawnshops in Singapore is doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In a pawn shop in the Mall Бендемир in Singapore Джанани Амиртхалинга lays the Golden bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for the schooling of his daughter.
«My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is there,» said Ms. Амиртхалинга.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) per month as administrator and her husband still works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of Southeast Asia, where the amount of debt of households is growing is that ValueMax, where she spends their deal, this week became the third pawnshop, registered at stock exchange of Singapore.
Secured loan jewelry is not just a fast way to get your money S$1300 in the case of Ms. Амиртхалинга), but almost as cheap as unsecured Bank loans.
Usually pawnshops in Singapore calculate effective annual interest rate of 17%, slightly above - 15,4 %, offered in the Department of United Overseas Bank, a local lender with branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can make loans faster than banks.
So millions of people throughout the region are treated in pawnshops, as families feel pressure due to rising cost of living and rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap credits, подпитывавшихся loose monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and middle income turn in pawnshops, to compensate for the decrease in revenues as slowing in their economies.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating Agency, has indicated the increase of the family leverage, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80 % of GDP compared with 60 % in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, for this week's barely emerged from technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued declines in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
«The point is that with the price increase people in middle and lower parts [of the income scale] will be looking for ways to Supplement their incomes where only be able to», - said song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, the Malaysian Bank.
Record-high gold prices in the last two years have increased the haste with which people put their personal belongings, as they use the possibility to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 % of the things pledged 200 of pawn offices of the city-state, are the gold.
People say: «the Price of gold looks good, let us put a gold chain grandmother and get it back next month».
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnshops EasyMoney observed increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20 %.
Growth in a Lombard business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Department in Бендемире and 15 other in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also outside of Asia, too, says Йеах Lee Ching, Executive Director ValueMax.
The company will Fund the expansion, using 60 percent of S$66 million raised this week in the result of placement of shares on the stock exchange of Singapore.
While some lenders have caused the fire of criticism due to high interest rates, Ms. Йеах says that Lombard not only offers cheaper rates than other creditors, he also does not increase the debt directly.
«Clients lay the items that they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt,» she says.
Bet wins more and more wide public recognition as a means to obtain a short-term secured funding.
And pawnshops are not only those categories of people who are in dire financial Straits.
Rich people in Singapore also use Department ValueMax, laying gold bars or watch Rolex who can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
«They include high net worth individuals who need to borrow money for short term commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome the temporary cash problems,» says Ms. Йеах.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.

Russian security officials do not know anything about the group "brotherly circle" - Novye Izvestia
This writes the INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement bodies of the Russian Federation.
"After the media reported the introduction of Ministry of Finance of the USA Leps in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate 'brotherly circle', we reviewed all of the database, but this group is not found", - said the Agency interlocutor.
According to him, the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As written previously "NO", yesterday the U.S. Department of Treasury published on its website a list of suspected members of a criminal gang "brotherly circle".
Among them was called the Russian singer Grigoriy Leps.
It appears in the list as "Grisha", played on the eve.
Data of the popular Russian artist they match.
Are the exact name of Grigory Лепсевридзе, nickname, date and place of birth.
In addition Leps, there are mentioned another five people.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former USSR, whose nationality was not specified.
In the United States believes that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket transported to the bandits money at their request.
The message attached photo of the singer and contains all the data that corresponds to reality.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a home in Phuket.
The Ministry said that they intend to impose sanctions on Leps.
Recording of the man in the black lists of the U.S. Treasury entails blocking his assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with persons living in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serikova stated that no notification to the singer have been reported: "Difficult to answer the question whether it is Gregory, everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the USA".
All that knows Leps is the information media.
Officially it personally had no notifications, although I do not know, whether there are they in such cases.
"And, of course, all this, on the one hand, funny, and on the other surprising and unexpected," she said to RIA Novosti.
According to her, Phuket, Grigory Leps lives, but, according to the U.S. Treasury, the house on the Thai island he really is.
She said that today Leps is extended tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news caught him during the flight in the city of Blagoveshchensk.

Black box you have a car?
Until American designers roads trying to find money to repair scattered system of roads, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box, neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, tracking every проезжаемую motorist mile and transmitting the information to the officials are at the centre of a controversial attempts to modernize the outdated system of financing of highways of America, undertaken by the planners in Washington and the state.
Usually boring arena planning highways unexpectedly gave rise to intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians joined ecological groups in lobbying for the provision to the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of проезжаемых your miles and even, perhaps, how they pass, and then use this information for the preparation of tax accounts.
Tea party movement in shock.
The American civil liberties Union is also deeply concerned about and raises a number of concerns about privacy.
And although Congress could not yet agree or not to continue, several States not going to wait.
They wonder how over the next decade, you can go to a system where drivers pay for each mile of the road, which they are passing.
Thousands of motorists have already assumed testing these black boxes, some of which have the function of satellite tracking.
It is really necessary for our country.
«This is not an issue on which we may be the right choice,» said Hasan Ихрата, Executive Director of the Association of governments of southern California, which trains plans to start tracking the state authorities miles, проезжаемых every California motorist, by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
Technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds of the Government Fund the construction of roads, financed by taxes that Americans are paying at the gas stations.
Americans don't buy so much gasoline as before.
Vehicles passing more miles on one gallon.
The Federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even a penny with the high prices for gasoline.
«Tax on gasoline is simply impossible to save,» said Lee Маннич, expert of transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state was recently installed on 500 cars tracking devices for system testing помильной payment.
«This will be the best alternative in the long term,» he said.
Nerds call it помильной user fees.
Not surprisingly, this idea attracts city liberals, because through taxes will change the nature of trips to alleviate congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are looking at this system in development strategies to achieve the targets set ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming.
But a member of the house of representatives bill Shuster (R-PA), Chairman of the transport Committee of the chamber, said that he also sees this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market advocates in the Fund «Reason» also delighted that force drivers to pay for each mile.
«This is not just a tax that will go into a black hole,» said Adrian Moore, Vice President for political Affairs Reason.
People pay for what they receive.
This movement is also supported by two former Ministers of transport of the USA in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction помильной payment.
The US Senate approved last year a pilot project worth $ 90 million, which was attended by about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the house of representatives rejected this proposal because of concerns rural legislators representing the voters who in everyday life often have to drive many miles to get to work or city.
Several States and cities, however, moving this way yourself.
The enthusiasm is manifested in the state of Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country involved 5000 drivers.
These drivers will soon pay staff for miles mileage instead of the gasoline tax.
In Nevada pilot project has already been completed.
In new York, he is considered.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
A coalition of I-95, which includes the transport departments of 17 States of the East coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), explores how they can carry out these changes.
This concept has gained General acceptance.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the government can track their every move.
«Concerns about "big brother" and similar things is a big problem,» said Aladdin Khan, head of the questions of strategy and performance management of the transport Department of the state of Nevada.
It was not what people wanted.
When trials were in full swing, the American civil liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: «It is easy to turn these devices in devices of the full-scale monitoring».
There is no need to create a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which will expand to store records about the routine movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several States where there are difficult search for a cheap technology, which would allow the state authorities to keep records of проезжаемых vehicle miles, but no information about the place and time.
If you can do it, said Khan, the society will feel more relaxed.
Search of this technology have led some state agencies to small, young company in California called the True Mileage.
Initially, this company is not concerned with assisting in the collection of taxes in the state.
She tried to leave on the emerging market of the types of auto insurance, where drivers pay based on mileage.
But the devices that it tests attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically loaded using a modem.
«People will be more inclined to do this if you are not tracking and speed not tracking their location,» said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of the True Mileage.
Had a couple of big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state.
There is much less expensive and less Intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, the designers are experimenting with the provision of drivers of various options.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they may give up the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that passing all state residents.
In other places they hope to sell the idea cautious public, forcing the device to do more, not less.
New York city transportation officials seek to develop налогооблагающее device that will also accept payment by Parking meters, provide a «pay as you go» insurance and collect data pool of speed in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
«Motorists will attract the benefits that would be offered»the document says urban design.
Some designers of transport systems, however, think about whether all the talk about помильной payment huge distraction factor.
In the city transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay area's officials say that Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust Fund for the construction of roads, raising taxes on gasoline.
Additional lump sum or annual tax could be charged with the drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline them to pay their fair share.
«No need for radical surgical intervention, when all you have to do is take a couple of aspirin,» said Randy Рентшлер, Director of the Commission on legislation and public relations.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life and many other things.

Pope Francis call first cardinals in February
Pope Francis erect in San new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time during his service on 22 February, as announced Thursday the Vatican.
The cardinals are the senior clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they elect dad, so Francis will appoint its first group of people, who would eventually participate in the selection of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinal.
However, after reaching the cardinal 80 years of age he may no longer take part in the election of the Pope is the prerogative of the group 120 «cardinals-electors».
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony erection in a dignity will be held a meeting of all the cardinals, known as the Consistory.
«Daddy Francis decided in advance to inform about your decision to convene Consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from around the world,» said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the organization «Catholic vote» said that by February the number of cardinals electors may decrease.
He said that usually the Pope calls so many cardinals, as necessary, to again increase the number of cardinals electors up to 120, and so many cardinals over the age of 80 years, as he wants to.
The Consistory of the next year will be of great importance, because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.
Currently, there is a bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy.
«Will be interesting to see appoint the new Pope and the cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance,» he said.
In South America live forty percent of the Catholics, but they represented a negligible number of cardinals.
This will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the St. Francis of the Council of cardinals group of eight cardinals from around the world, which is mandated to seek ways of reforming the Church.
Last dad would decide everything yourself.
«Now Francis chose eight cardinals to help him,» said Valero.
He said that «quite possible»that Francis would apply to the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - all this for us for the first time.
Valero said that the Pope usually constructed in the position of cardinal bishops of the large parish, but Francis «is full of surprises so we never know whom he would call».

Currently stamp duty on residential real estate in the districts of Kensington and Chelsea, Kensington and Chelsea, at $ 708 million pounds in fiscal year 2012/13, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West, Йоркширу and Хамберу combined.

A regular meeting of the Association of machine-builders of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsk automobile plant.
The event also included a presentation of the new line for production of electric-welded pipes of steel.
As said the commercial Director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov, in 2011, with the advent of the new proprietor of the marketing research was carried out to study the market of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tonnes of welded pipes per month.
After this decision was made to change the profile of the factory and the installation of equipment for their production.
This year already shipped more than 7 thousand tons of produced products.
Investments in the plant totaled more than 120 million roubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October launched a new mill, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces as a small profile of the pipe, which is used to heat the individual farm, small forms of the construction and furniture industry, large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which represents about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, number of employees at the enterprise not decreased - now it amounts to 157 people in the plans during the purchase of new equipment - increase staff by more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is involved in retraining of personnel, and necessary specialists are selected from already available.
In future it is planned to introduce a new unit longitudinal cutting of steel up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, and also another camp, with the rate of production of pipes up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014 the company is going to master production of pipes used in the housing and communal services.
Company management sets the task to close to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in the product.
Deputy Director of investment policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to modernization of the machine-building enterprises.
This is the aim and forms of state support of the industry, which include compensation for interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and expenses on his lease.
In the current year for these purposes will be allocated 150 million rubles, two thirds of this money has already been spent.
The last Commission which will consider contracts subsidies, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget costs of compensation for participation of local producers in international fairs.
Next year's budget envisages funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used for compensation of leasing payments and credits for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million on energy efficiency programs.
Reduced to 72 million rubles for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment that is produced in the South of the Tyumen region for oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the long run, this form of support will be stopped, as motive of the compensation of the tax on extraction of mineral resources, oil companies paid to the regional budget.
Currently they do not and subsidies become direct expenditure liabilities in the region.
With this in mind the government of the region priority considers the direct support of industrial enterprises, and not to Finance through them the oil industry.
Assistance budget will be linked to investment projects which will be implemented in production.
Many executives expressed concern about the current situation in the relations with the oil.
The subsidy on the purchased equipment is the competitive advantage of industry in the South of the Tyumen region, and its abolition it will be difficult to compete on price with the average strip of Russia, where more than cheap labor.
In addition, it is unclear from the continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP, Rosneft, which is not yet to place their orders at the Tyumen enterprises.
Agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and an application for its renewal have been received.
Currently, companies in southern areas that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, can not form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains, will the taxes from the oil produced in the Uvat district of oil in the budget of region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner fields.

Possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in a Chicago campaign headquarters and in the oval office.
Only six of the closest advisers to the President - including Daley, a former head of the election headquarters of Obama's Jim Messina and former senior White house advisers David Axelrod and David Плуффа knew that the replacement is considered.
The book "the Rates doubled" claims that Daley was the initiator attempts to replace Biden, despite their «close personal relationship», but eventually withdrew from this step, when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral list does not improve significantly the chances of Obama.»
In an interview with Martin Daly confirmed that the administration really considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.
«I actively advocated the consideration of many things, and this was one of them,» said the daily newspaper.

Legislation prohibiting forced Russians to drink less beer
The Russian brewers bad mood.
According to their estimates, consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is the best.
Although businessmen was initially expected to increase.
After all, this year is for them fail: sales fell 7 percent.
All this told the head of one of the largest Breweries in the country, the President of the Union of Russian brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of Adam Smith Institute "FMCG Goods in Russia", which has just concluded in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already dropped by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant strengthening of the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - the drink with a small percentage of alcohol, - informed the listeners Schoeps.
No country in the world has such a hard limit of the beer market, unpredictable introduction of new illogical ban, which is allegedly justified by the struggle with alcohol abuse.
Brewer complained that many of the legal prohibitions designed to reduce the abuse of alcohol, do not have any particular effect, however, there is increasing constantly initiatives.
It hurts all the producers of beer hit entered this year prohibition to sell alcohol in kiosks.
"We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers," said Dr. Isaac Sheps.
Next year brewers two forecasts.
Optimistic scenario - the one that was spoke Schoeps: sale of beer will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 per cent.
To preserve their profits, businesses are forced to move away from varieties intended for mass consumption, in the class "premium": beer will be less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of a decline in sales with a small amount of alcohol is not yet seen.
"According to my observations, the level of diseases of alcoholism remains approximately at the same level, - said the doctor-narcologist Alex Sotnikov.
However, increased the proportion of patients who use surrogates liquors, as well as those who got hooked on alcohol-containing soft drinks like "Jaguar", whereas ten years ago was dominated by precisely this "beer alcoholism.

What will be the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year the city authorities promise to arrange all the more transport hubs).
By 2020 it is planned to put into operation 255 TPU.
What really turns the project, understood our correspondent.
A couple of months ago at the metro station "Smolenskaya" of Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line appeared construction fence.
The inscription reads that goes developing transport interchange hub.
All this was very strange, because next to the "Smolenskaya" no land transport stops and therefore take on it.
To get to the nearest bus stop on the Garden ring, it is necessary to overcome some 130 metres, including land crossing Карманицкий lane.
Now the "Smolensk" almost all finished.
Disappeared flower stall, dismantled stand for Newspapers, and asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced by the building.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport hubs are flat and capital, - explained in the press-service of the Moscow Department of transport.
Capital TPU yet.
And planar involve the construction of Parking lots, conclusion of commercial objects, hinder passengers, creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, the plane TPU even engaged in the transport workers and professional благоустроители of the Department for capital repair of the city of Moscow.
Hub is not necessarily a complex structure, - explains the Director of the Institute of transport Economics and transport policy of the Higher school of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes quite a roof over their heads and scoreboard, which inform about the time of arrival of transport.
For example, at the metro station "Yasenevo" recently opened quite full-featured plane hub.
Let without awnings, but with перехватывающими Parking and placards indicating when the bus.
But in the pursuit of a number of officials are written in the TPU all that is handy.
In 2011 the municipality planned to build at all about all 151 node, 59 of the capital construction.
Now the plans up to 2020 there are even 255 TPU.
Of them a hundred and fifty promise to pass this year.
Although the city has a program of development of TPU has no qualitative criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and transport.
Report on a number of objects, but the quality of transplantation on each of them often worsens.
Criteria, according to the expert, shall be two: first - time decrease of transplantation, secondly convenience.
First of all, the opportunity to change the type of transport, comfort in the rain.
In Moscow in the regeneration of TPU sometimes comes out exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the metro station "VDNKH".
Earlier commuter buses from the Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now they stop was moved to the opposite side of Ярославки the street of Cosmonauts.
Further from the metro, much further from the monorail, but closer to the residential houses.
The gift that the residents did not want to under the Windows of the bus station and complained in all instances.
With capital TPU in Moscow didn't happen.
The first of them started building five years ago at the metro station "Planernaya".
The project was intended to be a model.
And really turned out to be the model for how hub and left at the mercy of the investors becomes banal shopping centre.
No, there are platforms for buses, shed, not to go from the underground in the rain, and three floors of Parking lots.
However, the Khimki trolley buses produced in Belarus №202 and №203 in Moscow TPU designated gave fundamentally.
Them as strangers pushed away from the metro.
But the place is under trade more left.
One only service 32 store, but there almost everything from pet supplies to the showroom.
Well, actually, if someone of bus passengers need to buy a new car on the road?
We, when building the capital TPU, somehow always manage to shopping centre.
Recently the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the Parking decided to give to the market.
Now on the third floor of TPU "Planernaya" among marked on the floor of Parking spaces is a brisk trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, нерусская speech and guards viciously поглядывающие on our photographer.
Hub morphed into a Bazaar.
The matter is that earlier at the metro station "Planernaya" the market was, but it was torn down.
And in the Prefecture of traders regret allowed to intercepting Parking hub.
Still due to high prices there is always empty.
The most funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build on its place... a new plane TPU.
Such is the reshuffle.
At the metro station "Kaluzhskaya" distance approach from the vestibule of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping centre, allegedly TPU, distance increased to 170 meters.
To take the bus, you must go through the Mall.
After 22 hours when it is closed, it is necessary to bypass it under the open sky.
However, construction on "Planernaya" and "Kaluga" soon would seem mild by comparison.
In mid-September, the urban land Commission of the city hall approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPU.
Four of them will be 25-storey, except for two-three underground levels.
The main monster will grow at the metro station "Tushino"418,7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of Directorate for railway stations, Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of TPU near a metro station, told reporters: in future high-rise buildings will accommodate shops, hotels and apartments.
The officials claim that multilevel Parking will occupy from one third to a half of the area.
Take for example the "people's garages.
Say, garage 258 Parking places, recently built on the International street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
Means for Parking by 2.6 thousand auto "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will be about 80 thousand "of squares".
This is less than a third of the colossus that there are going to build.
Let one or two floors will go on all sorts of platforms for buses.
Remains of at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
And this, for a moment, almost two Gum.
If the capital of TPU stations build the railroad, the other sites will learn метрополитеновцы.
They also promised that there will be many "object functional purpose, including hotels, offices and gyms.
By the way, in the Moscow city property Department recently told journalists that the draft decision by which investors will be able to apply for a land plot for the TPU to officials directly.
Without competition.
Therefore, they say that transport issues for the city - priority.
Perfect TPU is, for example, station "Harvard in Boston or "Спадайна" in Toronto, said Alexander Morozov.
There trolleybuses and trams go down under the ground level of the underground and distance approach from the train station to the tram is just 50 meters without going outside.
Round no unnecessary trade.
But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.
Either nothing will build any kind of отгрохаем 25 floors with offices and apartments.

Profit Bombardier is reduced with falling supply and quantity of orders for aircraft
Corporation Bombardier, the canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains, announced on Thursday on reduction of net profit by 15 percent under the influence of the decreased number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway division.
Located in Montreal, Bombardier also did not publish any data on flight testing of its latest CSeries aircraft and provided no new information about whether made ambitious plans for the introduction of aircraft in commercial operation by next September.
After the first flight of the prototype aircraft held about one and a half months ago, he had still only three times, raising questions about whether testing phase on track.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to the fall of shares of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock exchange.
Cameron Доерксен, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced on Thursday its assessment of «above average» to «industry average» from a conviction that the growth of the shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
«Although the reduction in the number of aircraft delivery was generally predictable, we, of course, disappointed with the performance gain of transport Department», - said Доерксен in the review of the stock market.
We believe that Bombardier receives new orders for the CSeries as the continuation of the flight-test program.
However, if in the coming months will not be announced on new orders, we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier is hoped that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to gain a place in the lower price segment of the market where now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was submitted in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, the firm orders for the CSeries yet not too much - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to verify the statements of company on fuel efficiency and the potential profitability of the airliner.
Just now there are 403 order and agreement with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive officer Pierre Beaudoin was sure that Bombardier achieve its target of 300 firm orders to the moment when the first plane will be put into commercial service.
On Thursday leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward according to plan.
«Test model of the aircraft remained on earth longer than expected,» - said he during a conference call, adding that at times when the aircraft were planned ground tests and software updates.
All manufacturers plan to test different.
We decided to hold the first flight and make a break for updates, so we did.
It will be the same throughout the flight-test program.
The second of the five test samples must take a flight in the coming weeks and all the others soon followed, as the company informs.
Yet analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first client will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft is 12 months after the first flight.
Bombardier said that it assesses the commissioning and provide new information in the next few months.
«The slow pace of flight tests - even though, apparently, and corresponds to an internal graphics Bombardier - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be moved to the first quarter of 2015», - said Доерксен.
In the third quarter, terminated September 30, net income Bombardier decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.
Gross profit decreased slightly, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4,56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth in the world largest aircraft manufacturer said that he put 45 aircraft for the quarter, less than the figure for the previous year - 57.
The total number of orders has fallen from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders for the aerospace division was $32,9 billion on September 30, unchanged since 31 December.
«In aerospace results correspond to our goals, however, a small number of incoming orders and General market conditions became an unpleasant factor», - said he.
Gross income for aerospace direction fell 13 percent to $2 billion
Bombardier, the world's largest manufacturer of trains, said that gross income in this sector grew by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly higher than the 31 of December.
The income of the transport division had a negative impact problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Management has declared, that in the fourth quarter will be presented to the new development plan.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that chief financial officer of the Corporation Google Patrick Пичетт will be on the Board, fell by 8.5 percent, up From$4,83 at auction in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor, Bombardier, said on Thursday about the reduction of the quarterly revenue 10 percent.

Two officers of the YMCA NSW were accused of sexual offences against children to lay charges in 2011 against an employee child care facilities in Карингбахе Jonathan Lord, told the Royal Commission on sexual abuse of children.
But in the opening statement, the Commission said that she has never had Affairs with the cases of sexual abuse of children within their organization.
Chief Executive officer of Philip Хэйра asked about one case, when the employee YMCA was charged with crimes related to child pornography, and on the other case, when an instructor at the YMCA gym Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children, were under his supervision, in 1991.
Mr hare said Gail Furness, the lawyer assisting the Commission that he knew about the first, but I didn't know about the second one.
He acknowledged that the YMCA in the opening speech for the Commission has also made a mistake, arguing that were external audit of the YMCA, have recognized that the YMCA is located in the first row to ensure the safety of children.»
The Commission evidence suggests that the YMCA had been notified that it has received the second since the end of the four possible estimate on the results of the audit of the quality performed by the Department of education and communities in August of this year.
Mr. hare, who joined the YMCA, when he was 21, admitted that he and subordinate guide committed a blunder, hiring Lord, and failed to provide a clear understanding of the personnel of their obligations related to the allegations of violations of security policy children.
Earlier this year the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys for two years, his work at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned at least six years.
But Mr. hare rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics YMCA prevented employees to report violations of the Lord in the sphere of safety of children.
Employees testified that they witnessed violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his knee he told me that he likes one of them, and allowed them to play with your mobile phone.
Daniel Оквелл, which was under the leadership of Lord and asked to teach her child protection, because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Барнат, Manager custody of the children branch of the YMCA in Карингбахе, who was the CEO of the Lord, «very frightening and often hard-to-reach».
The Executive Director stated that he does not accept the explanation of the employees that they were embarrassed to report on the situation of its senior management.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord withdrew them from the thought of having to report it.
Mr hare said that he presented to the Council of YMCAs of New South Wales its belief that the lesson for the organization of the incidents with Jonathan Lord,» not «regards the provision of information by all stakeholders-employees, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr hare said that the decision to force employees to sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the allegations were made by Director General of the YMCA childcare Лиамом Whitley.
He said that this was designed to prevent spoilage of evidence, but «overzealous» and this decision is poorly implemented.
YMCA of New South Wales was not safe for children organization while working in her Jonathan Lord in the period of 2009-2011, reported to the Commission an expert on the problems of abuse of children Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University.
He said that there were «serious problems» for the recruitment, selection, coaching, training of the personnel and control over them.
