Anger over the verdict to the organizers of the Bali bombing
The survivors and relatives of the 202 died as a result of the bombing in Bali in 2002, angrily reacted to the verdict of the last of the plotters, who appeared in court, and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in south-east Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for his role in creating explosive devices, used during the attack.
He could be freed within 15 years, if will receive parole.
45-year-old defendant was convicted in the mass killings as a result of the attack on two night club in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including in a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that the man nicknamed "Demoman" for his reputation of the Wizard for making explosives, should be sentenced to death.
The decision deepened the painful memories of the mother of Perth June of Cortina who lost their 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Barely restraining his tears, she said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
"I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before a firing squad, " said Ms. Cortina AAP.
"I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer be grandchildren and I don't see my daughters."
Club "sari" was destroyed when it was set into motion a massive explosive device, planted in a van parked outside, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the bar "Paddy," where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack bomb, only 20 seconds before.
After the attack he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times, being connected to the life-support system.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiah, responsible for the carnage-Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam of Samudra who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more.
To save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.
Get 20 years after killed 202 people and wounded hundreds-it is not so much.
Patek is the last of the participants of the terrorist attack in Bali, were tried before a court.
He was hiding for nearly 10 years, but in the end was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where American troops killed the former leader of al-Qaida Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial an FBI agent showed that data intelligence testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore the link between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortina.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he has caused to other people.
The sentence imposed in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"This year there will be a lot of tears," says Ms. Cortina.
Patek can still appeal against their sentence.

In the last two meetings, the Hawks Khabibulin initially missed six washers from Tampa Bay, " and then four-from "Ottawa," and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth retain washers.
We need to play well, and in the last two games I didn't make it, CSNChicago words Khabibulin.
"I need to find the confidence in training, perhaps, is to approach him to games, and to try to achieve the best results.
You need to examine your past games and to work on those weaknesses that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But somehow, after a few heads all turning into a snowball.
Perhaps, I need to relax a little.
Goalkeepers-I don't think I'm that one-always try to hold a perfect game.
If I pass four, five, six, I'm not in.
It doesn't matter what happens before my gate.
I'm still working on yourself, not to miss so much of the washers.
It's great that my mates support, but in principle it's very simple: I need to play better.
Two games-it is not the whole season, but I wanted to hold them much better.
But it happened, what has happened.
I have to put it to the side.

Restrict exports of energy began a unique program to rescue... of storks' nests
In the old times, to prevaricate yard storks, villagers at the high post established a wheel from wagons, and heavy nest was well on it.
Such special poles already do not, so the storks chosen posts transmission lines-intertwined branches on wires, allowing Istinye house is safe.
Grandmother Anne, near the house in the village of Ivanovka Petrikov district already twenty years living Istinye family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite the best efforts of its residents.
Birds put top new branches, while the lower layer has already declined between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, sorry for family storks, which every year was Gnostics at the Metochion, freaked and malediction during the summer, three or four chicks, but without light to stay.
As soon as birds flew in to the warm regions, grandmother Anne telephoned Zarychanski DEPN is that reliance.
And even did not expect that there will react so quickly.
When our experts came to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest in general still holds, "said technical director DTEK" Dneprooblenergo Sergey Berezovsky.
The wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150-200 kilograms, began the corrosion.
At any moment birds could die from the electrical discharge.
Yes, and local residents risked remain without light because of damage to wiring.
So a linear engineers began the rescue operation nests, and not for the first time in our practice.
Helped scientists-ornithologists from Dnepropetrovsk National University, which has developed a scheme of transferring the nest.
They held training for employees of the regional networks.
Dnepropetrovsk the famous finches Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineering specialists at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
For a start, has calculated that in the field in an emergency condition are more than 50 Istinye "flats."
For their reconstruction were special metal platform, like a funnel.
The foundation has Opletal Ivovine branches, and then moved into the old nest.
According to experts, it is enough to lay the old branch as the basis to birds learned the nest and returned to him.
Already then the storks themselves should be completed his house.
A month ago in the village of gerbil NAK district was reconstructed the first nest.
Alongside ElectrOpera set a concrete pole and placed it on a platform with the old, already livable nest.
The whole operation cost power in nine thousand UAH.
But on days such as housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikov district at the patriarchal grandmother Ani.
Here the platform was enshrined in the same place, only was hoisted above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that careful, conservative birds won't even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has been overhauled.
Until the end of the year the same reconstruction expects four more nests in old town and Zarychanski areas restrict exports.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others their ruthlessly killed.
The other day, the whole area was the news-in the village of Ust-the heater Apostolaki district, on the opening day of hunting pheasants, poachers for fun shot swan family, lived at the local pond.
Noble birds not feared people-locals they were fed and was not offended.
When the villagers, hearing the shots, resorted to a pond, four handsome-Swans was already lying dead on the water.
Now employees Apostolaki the police station the police find out who shot at birds, included into the red book.

A lawyer with cocaine addiction, which warned the ringleader of a criminal gang about police investigation, jailed
The 42-year-old Basharat DITT passed information to criminal authority Nile Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction will be revealed
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment Liverpool's Royal Court.
The lawyer, who told the drug about major police investigation because it was feared revelations about his secret drug dependence, was jailed for three years.
The 42-year-old's Basharat DITT passed criminal authority Nile Scarborough secret information about the investigation into his activities in illegal trafficking of drugs, after he had been threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed bash and nicknamed among criminals " steep lawyer," was arrested at home in 2011 after a police operation surveillance for Scarborough, whom he represented earlier on court, associated with drugs.
The officers noticed as 32-year-old Scarborough has left three of the bag with the cocaine, a lawyer in the town of Blackburn, Lancashire County until he was at a dinner of the association of lawyers with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that the ditch "regularly used" drug class A, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011 he tried illegally to obtain information about arrests two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were in this time under police surveillance in large-scale investigation into the activities of the criminal organization in the distribution of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and another 32 people were later jailed after police seized during a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million as well as more than £ 200,000 in cash.
The 42-year-old DITT passed information to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction will be revealed.
Today at Liverpool Crown Court of DITT, who works in the legal company Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was covered in shame after admitting his guilt in two cases of intentional of obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted possession of cocaine in one of the previous court sessions.
The revelation a lawyer happened after police investigating the activity of Scarborough, found out that he regularly spoke with diet by phone since February 2011.
Two of the detective followed suspects and found, as he went to the House of DITT in Blackburn and put drugs 60 percent purity in the Black Glove golf course under trash boxes lawyer.
Soon after the transfer of Scarborough has repeatedly called him from Dith, who was at the dinner in the football stadium Ewood Park team Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer has returned home for drugs; between them took nine conversations.
The court has heard that the dit "regularly used" cocaine, after tests found traces of the class A drug in his hair, a wallet and credit cards.
The ditch was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said that he spoke with the suspected dealer, because that was his client, and insisted that their communication is "secret law."
During his detention the diet took his wallet and tried to remove a few credit cards, but they all were confiscated, he was also taken from a sample of hair.
Interrogated by the police he said that along with the workplace, he had and the Home Office, and customers came to his home on legal affairs.
However, the court learned that an arrest after he called the largest participants in the drugs, some of which he had previously presented in court to tell that they know the detectives.
In his accusatory speech Ann White said: "If anyone and knows that it is not necessary to break the law, it is a lawyer in criminal cases."
Mr DITT accused of abusing his position to counsel in criminal matters, because he came in too close relations with certain clients.
The contact, we are talking about is not just a drug dealer and a drug dealer, drug-supplying his own lawyer.
Some of his talk, of course, will turn out to be legitimate, because it was their lawyer.
But it is largely shifted the boundaries of normal relations between lawyer and client.
He was hampered the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activity.
Mr ditch not possessed his profession, and it was a disgrace.
He too came with certain clients, in particular, Scarborough, and allowed to doubt in its interest.
The DITT has not admitted fault and stated: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and would like to transmit information Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting of the senior officer Lee Halstead, of Lancashire Police, said: "Mr DITT turned from counsel in criminal cases in criminal offender, as soon as he started to buy drugs from organised crime."
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the main participants of the criminal gangs who had instructed him to extract valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and to inspire the public trust and confidence.
Mr DITT betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind his profession.
The investigation into Mr DITT led a division of Lancashire on particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already secured for him the sentence on three cases of storage of cocaine, and now to obstructing justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case will serve as a warning to criminals that nobody is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and will attract to justice.
The Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years after admitting his guilt in a conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people who participated in the fraud, were in the sum Sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On its website the DITT organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him over dinner-Mohammed Ali, and motivation to work-it is inequality.

The manufacturers of jet aircraft feud about the width of the seats at stake in large orders
Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft was a bitter dispute about the width of a tourist class seats on long flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
Literary dispute around the width of the seats available to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class, whose interests are not always in the spotlight of the airlines, with the amount allocated to them space plays a key role in the claims about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft, Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of industry standard that would seat width of no less than 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class, but its main U.S. rival, Boeing says that it must solve the airline.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales all larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21 expected potentially record orders.
The design of the rear of the plane-especially, whether sitting 9 or 10 people in a row-occupies a central place in the statements about economic efficiency of new projects "mini-aircraft."
Boeing argues that its new 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says that its competing version of the A350 will be transported in the economy class, 350 people on the seat width of 18 inches, located on nine in a row.
Giants aircraft often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the show in Dubai, where the 777X, is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers a slide showing three people in the restaurant, pressed to each other, under the name "would you agree on this?."
"Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John dashing.
With the change of diet people gain weight, but aircraft seats cardinal has not changed.
Between the early 1970's, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards of modern travel, and the turn of the century the weight of the average American men between the ages of 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the Department of Health.
A waist circumference of middle-American men of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistical data, in the health service.
Airbus says that its competitor to the concept of the seat of the 1950s, when the average waist circumference, recently called "reactive audience," was already.
Airbus says that ordered the study attesting that extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputed Airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the convenience of salon depends not only on the width of the seats.
"It really boils down to providing airline of choice and the ability to do that in their opinion they should make for success," said specialist Boeing on the salons Kent Craver.
They don't want us to have decided for them, that will bring them profits.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it increasingly becomes a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is the race for orders for the planes, estimated at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades-enough to change the relationship between American and European exports.
As first reported in July, the Reuters news agency, the location of the seats is what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing say about 20-percent increase in profitability at one place in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The characteristics of the Boeing based in part on comparing 10-seat rows 777X with original 9-seater layout rows of constructive solutions 777.
The win in the unit cost of production is reduced when compared with 10-seat layout in use today.
"The reason that Boeing is doing, is to squeeze more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared with our development," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort of Airbus in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say salons with a full 10-seater series for existing 777-X indicate that many passengers prefer tight seating that can go hand-in-hand with lower rates.
"The seat width of 18 inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view offer Airbus due to a threat from 777-th model," said specialist interior Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl network.
Airbus and Boeing do not put chairs, but offer the catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select.
Traveling around the world, the sellers of jet aircraft even blocking a Roulette to check the competing design.
Commending the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense layout of the salon for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus A350 offers 10-seat rows, but says that she still did not sell.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for additional modifications salons, offering a wider seats near the aisle on some of their planes.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, as experts say, its call for a new industry standard is hardly " will soar, but could distract attention from the wave of sales models of 777X.

In the framework of the security budget from the regional budget is about 25 billion rubles, " said Oleynikov.
Also, the vice governor noted that only three of urban settlements-Mytisci, Odintsovo and distemper-the amount of revenue is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The incomes of rural settlements of many areas of less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough."
The costs of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of Moscow region is over 70%, "and there has been a reduction in the quality of services," said Oleynikov.

Concern about security in Mozambique is growing as a result of the conflict influential people
Under looking down upon them by the statue of Samora Machel, president-founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo, to chant slogans about the world on one of the rare here demonstrations.
"We want the return of the world; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousse, executive director of the investment.
Fearing for the future of their country, she swapped business attire on a T-shirt decorated with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese, and were joined on Thursday by the crowd on Independence Square.
Within two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and the Renamo is one of the most violent clashes since the conclusion of the truce more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo once was known rebel movement, which was at first by the white government of Rhodesia, and then by the government of South Africa of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the government of an independent country.
After the Armistice in 1992 it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again plunge into full-scale conflict, but recent events made me nervous foreign investors and local residents.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in north-west could raise more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling party's Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and the party of Renamo accuse each other in the tensions.
Party Renamo argues that the government was a ringleader of the latest clashes, attacking its members in the province of copal, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo, on October 17.
The attack on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked base Renamo and attempted to kill the Afonso Dhlakama-the leader of the group, told the newspaper the Financial Times Fernando Masing, Representative Renamo.
The government blames the Renamo in triggering clashes, accusing the party on the attack on the soldiers.
The President Armando Guebuza has tried to allay fears of instability.
The Gebuza told AFP, the French news agency Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt "a loser," THEhotel to use "all that is left of his power to try to prove that he can impose the government's own decisions."
As the Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown after reports that the Mazar said about the refusal of Renamo from the peace agreement of 1992.
He told the Financial Times that meant failure of the agreement by the party Frelimo.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but in all seriousness," said Mazar.
The previous negotiations between the parties has done little to defuse the crisis, which has a series of clashes this year.
"This is two influential person (Guebuza and Dhlakama), a freewheeling foreheads, " said Joseph Hanlon, Lecturer of the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to go on the necessary concessions.
Party Renamo, which tries to bring about electoral reform, has already said that it will boycott the municipal elections, scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted it as an attempt to pressure weakened the movement to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for the Renamo decreases since 1992, while the new party-the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former member of Renamo, is expected to improve their performance on these elections.
Mr Mazar says that Mr. Guebuza, who must step down next year, when ends his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he did not want a transparent election, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mazar.
It is unclear what capability the Renamo, but it has already made rapid and devastating attacks on police stations and cars on a key motorway leading from the north to the south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of sofa, which is located just a few hundred kilometers to the north of Maputo, but includes the Beira port, which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export the coal.
In June, Rio has suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo has threatened an attack on the railroad.
The Matang was evasive when he asked the question, I repeat Li Renamo this threat.
The party Renamo wanted "to warn the international community about what matters in Mozambique does not go very well," said Mazar.
The instability has intensified popular discontent with the government, and many people also care about corruption, the slow pace of development and recently increased kidnappings, " says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country are the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultan, demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about the Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want the resumption of the world, they want access to the roads," he said.

Scientists shed light on how the tail of dogs are associated with her mood.
Earlier research has shown that happy dogs by strings in the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while the alarmed dogs Palaguachi tail mainly in the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the family dog may notice these subtle differences in vilenie tail and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from Trotsky University, says: "It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain differently are involved in the formation of the stimulators that generate positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this and other species.
He added that, like humans, dogs have the right-hand side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs react to the versatile Povilionis tails of other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of heartbeat animals and analyzed their behavior.
Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes going in one direction and sometimes in another
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs video with dogs-or naturalistic version, or a silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we were able to manipulate the motion of the tail and send the tail more left or right."
When they saw that otherwise nothing expresses the dog had driven the tail right (from the point of view of wagging her tale dogs), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was left bent mainly (again from the point of view of wagging her tale dogs), their heart rate was more frequent and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said that he doesn't think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from her experience, what movements they should worry, and what is not.
He says: "If several meetings with other dogs and often Melanie their tail in one side is associated with more friendly behavior, while the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on that experience."
The researchers say that these results may give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of emotions his animal.
Expert in the field of behavior of Dogs by John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the veterinary school at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to test whether a value for dogs left and right side.
Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln have found that dogs turn your head to the left, if you look at an aggressive dog, and right, if you look at happy dog.
And in other scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: " Dogs often approached the dog-robot when Melanie her tail was left, not right, rather than to become alarmed, " opposite behavior towards Italian study."
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceived animals in films or dogs-robots as dogs.
Could be useful in the study of how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.
"While the various mammals there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which it can be registered their behavior, perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes going in one direction and sometimes in another.

Whether the elite of Europe to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the obligation to bring together representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in the relationship with the EU.
With this purpose we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK business and the EU.
The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a broad slice of the business in the UK, sectors and regions.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We found out that the vast majority of companies are now looking for opportunities for exports outside Europe, paying special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are in stagnation.
They want a government that gave priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reform of EU institutions.
When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to laws of products, most business leaders believed that control these key spheres of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives argued that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits from being in the trade zone of Europe, agreed with this even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European-minded of all the companies.
The last and most revealing-our poll of business leaders found that a clear majority wants the UK led to a change of the treaty and on relations with the EU, based on trade, not politics.
This result, which was observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on "meaningful change" that will return the powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high-achieving changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide 16-percent shift in voting to remain in the EU.
The prime minister should not be any doubt: This poll shows that the British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain's EU membership.
It also shows that the business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
The best conditions for British business and become more and more necessary as the eurozone is on a path toward closer economic and financial integration.
The priority should be jobs and growth in the UK, and shows the results of our survey, for business this means and focusing on trade and fundamental changes in regulatory activity of Brussels.

In Siberia should not be a vegan: Hothouse tomato will not replace Cupchik
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, was found by a RIA Novosti correspondent.
The people, products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
Here they don't move the winter without losses for health, and no greenhouse tomatoes not compensate, according on the eve of the day of vegans Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors.
To drink gallons oil
Strict vegetarianism, when refuse not only from meat and fish, but from milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable lifestyle.
However, doctors and nutritionists believe that in Novosibirsk in Siberia and other cities to follow such a strict standards in food, at a minimum, Nepalese for health.
Complete refusal from animal products harmful.
In animal proteins are indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for the plant.
Be sure to include in the diet at least milk or eggs, " says nutritionist Marina bogey.
She cites the example of fish, containing essential fatty acid omega-3.
Most rich them vegetable oil-linen.
"In order to consume it in the necessary for human beings, need gallons to drink Aneckstein or" says the nutritionist.
Doctors are confident that residents of Siberia special attention to diet, you need to spend the winter.
In this season of vegetarianism especially is in question.
In terms of our realities are imposed heavy demands on the food.
In order not to freeze, you need increased calorie.
"If people limit themselves on pet products, respectively, this calorie helps," says a specialist.
Agree with that doctor-nutritionist Olga OSCE.
She adds that imported fruits and vegetables-not a way.
Man better to eat mainly products, which are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is configured the best learning and digest these foods.
And in the winter people want not OK to Magritte and hot Cupchik or even something Unhasting, " explains his position as a doctor.
According to her, that can eat vegan, truly useful different grains, cereals, legumes, vegetables, apples, remaining in the winter, frozen berries.
But this, clearly, is not enough for nutrition.
According to the doctor's gastroenterologist Claudie Arifulina, Siberians in organisms level of sufficient vitamins only from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh environmental conditions, when temperatures may one day to change at 30 degrees and in May the snow, impractical.
The body for life will need energy, and this is, above all, the fat, " stated.
Doctors say that the veganista especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need a construction material, including in the form of amino acids.
But to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need increased protein, vitamins and microelements in the menu.
"Veanka them missing," the confident bogey.
Arifulina says that an adult are free to choose whatever they like, "to play in those toys, which wants."
He has already formed the organism, the skeleton, bodies.
But the children still have to eat a full.
If parents would deprive it of any kind of trace elements and amino acids, for him that he will be there, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, bones tomorrow will not recover," she said.
All surveyed specialists-physicians agree about low winter as grown in greenhouses and imported fruit and vegetables.
What to bring and grown in greenhouses, contains fewer essential we trace elements than (grown) in open ground.
"The quality of the products is not," says Bohay.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse fruits and vegetables are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of manufacturers to collect more detrimental to quality.
"The apples are brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and Lesnevich, tasteless tomatoes and neuropathy," cites examples of the medic, adding that they probably are excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And become the suppliers not vitamins, and fiber.
Don't agree with it, the Siberian Salaberria Physico-Technical Institute of Agrarian Issues, Candidate of Agricultural Sciences faith Petruk.
She says that with the right approach, and observance of all standards and requirements in greenhouses may be growing full of vegetables.
If you try to expel more square meter, then, of course, and water will be more likely to overfeed plants mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes are increasing rapidly, they are large, watery and unsweetened, " she explains, adding that the issue of quality, in the first instance, depend on conscience from the manufacturer.

Russia outside the urban pollution by car
Attempts to solve transport problems major cities were observed in most cities around the world since the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either about their rebuilding and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and the time of their use.
A widely-known example of Singapore, where imposed strict quotas to increase the number of private cars, and the right of their purchase bought at auction.
His price may be two to three times more than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced fee for entry into the centre of the city.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called Green Zone, where allowed entry only cars with a certain access using the fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The agency for the protection of the environment of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012, "five-year plan of clean air" worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Kommersant, director of the Department of Pollution Control transport Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection of Beijing whether Kunsheng, the main aim of the five-year plan-the reduction of air pollutants 20-35% by 2017, the increase of the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (5.2 million), as well as increase no more than 5% of the fuel in one vehicle.
According to the agency, now the vehicles in Beijing responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program-the restriction of the use of motor transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city's measure of "green five-year plan " include faster compared with the rest of the country in the transition to the euro standards fuel, the introduction of the local system of EastEnders and labelling of cars and fuel, restricting entry of cars in the central part of the city, the ban on the use of outdated vehicles (in addition, creating a financial incentive programs to replace the old cars to hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and official), development of public transport (including high-speed).
Among the automotive innovation of Beijing also applies to ban all private cars on movement within the fifth transport ring (just in the capital of China their six) one day a week (this information is contained in the trailing Mark vehicles), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only one-third the number in 2010).
According to Acting State Program "environmental protection for 2012-2020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced by up to 128 (in 2012, there were 138).
According to the ministry, in 2011 on the "mobile sources" accounted for 41% of all emissions of polluting substances into atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars in ten times larger than industrial, and in St. Petersburg-nine times.
In the Russian Federation until only begin to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on city streets.
The director of the Institute of Economics and Transport Policy HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car travel is obviously unpopular, they can be accepted by society only when their complete versatility.
In the case of Moscow there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts-official and personal automobiles, as well as the cars of privileged users, which total number is not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow).
A few days ago urbanists from Ecom in St. Petersburg has prepared the study, which analyzed the balance of urban areas between the residential development, with an area of the pavement and the number of vehicles.
The major findings of researchers: The centre of the city with roads in two times less required, and the majority of motorists who live in the center, do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time on parking or simply on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking and storage of cars, not to expand, and cut down on road a part (so that the streets were more friendly for pedestrians), as well as limit the use and placement of personal transport within the borders of the protective zone of the historical centre (with a total area about 3212 hectares covering a number of the central districts of the city).

And even if the Adamaoua could go to the doctor, many of them it would be unaffordable.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the cost of health care in it are private.
"Their only problem is poverty," said Belle.
And because of the poverty they can't enjoy their life."
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his countrymen, Bwelle became determined something to do.
Last year, Dr Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations.
He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization ascovime, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and another 30 people clod in vans, bind to the roof with medical supplies and travel over rough terrain to visit in need of the village.
Is not always accompanies them luck.
Once, they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they come, they come across as genuine heroes: This is a holiday with songs and dances and best room, which only can suggest local residents.
Free medical care in these villages, this really is a cause for celebration, and Bwelle with his wide smile and boundless energy more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team starts to take hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 people on each trip," said Belle.
They come from all over the area within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, and diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive the crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates-documents necessary for the school, which many poor families simply can't afford.
In the evenings the brigade performs simple operation under a local anesthesia.
The operation, as a rule, are held in the building of the school, municipality or in the house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to post, to make room for the next person.
Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitation of processing equipment, Belle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.
This unsustainable pace, but the determination of the brigade typically help to keep rural musicians.
"They all night beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work," said Belle.
On Sunday members of the brigade sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian foreign doctors and medical students, has spent 700 free operations last year, and they know that their help could have huge significance for those they help.
One man explained that he received a free operation to cure hernia will allow him to operate again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical techniques on weekends and work in a hospital surgeon Bwelle also works nights in a private medical clinics around Yaounde.
This is the second job, he said, provides 60 per cent of funding for his non-profit organizations; the rest are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Kathy O Melli, medical student, the second year Drexelbrook University in Philadelphia, the volunteer group Bwelle.
He has always either in hospital, or trying to earn money for the organization so that you can continue this campaign.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O Melli coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle in implementation of its tasks, it is-practice that they never would have received at home.
"We got the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped to remove the stain of blood or keep the tools for doctors bulle," said Mr. O Melli.
As a student, a sophomore, you would never have got such an opportunity in America.
The volunteers themselves usually pay for their own travel in Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But on arrival in Yaounde their meals, transport and training pays Bwelle.
"He is a hero, without a doubt," said Mr. O Melli.
He gives his life to this organisation, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon.
For Bwelle almost constant workload work is not a heavy challenge.
To help to live a happy life to others, to do this to his father promise is what brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when you do this job," said Belle.
"And I think about my father.
I hope he sees that I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
Go to the site ascovime and see what you can help.

For "Russian mafia" in the United States has finally established a new name - "The Circle"
This week, the black list " of the Russian mafia in America has been updated with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury has imposed in "brotherly circle" of three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis.
One of the Russians proved to be a well-known singer Grigory Leps, whom the US suspect in transportation money for members of the group.
In all, the black list of 22 people, implicated in "brotherly circle," and six affiliated with him.
Nevertheless, many experts express doubt that it really exists.
"The statement about' The past circle' looks more like an attempt to unite the fragmented criminal groups," the previously announced an expert on organized crime and professor at New York University Mark Galeotti.
In his opinion, "fraternal circle" reflects the popular perception of "Russian mafia ."
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else, who would have confirmed the existence of this criminal organization," quoted Mr Galeotti American Center for the Study of corruption and organized crime.
With Mr. Galeotti agree and professor at George Mason University Liz Shelley.
"If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but not the organization," it quoted the words of the Center for the Study of corruption and organized crime.
In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti suggested that "brotherly circle" unites in increasingly close Russian thieves in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hassan.
The crime boss was killed in January of this year.
So, the activities of the lash Shushanashvili and Zacharias Kalashov replenishment of the list in 2012, was closely connected with his Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, had the dad Hasano nephew.
Nevertheless Mr Galeotti notes that some of the personality and have no ties to Usoyan.
According to him, they were united rather common financial and criminal interests, for example the delivery of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal around the "fraternal circle" Olatz Arruti-beloved singer Russian President Vladimir Putin-has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we hope that we get from our American colleagues-partners more detailed information, the decision was made, why is it in such lists have contributed, " said press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case he (laps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.

Ex-US intelligence worker Edward Snowden, most likely, will not be able to travel outside of Russia for the the tapped telephone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As told to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer the questions of the representatives of the German prosecutor general's office in writing or in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia virtually excluded.
"In this case he will lose the refugee status and can be issued to Washington countries-American allies," said the interlocutor of agency.
"However, in principle, the general prosecutor's office and the Federal Republic of Germany could send in their representatives or to send written questions to Snowden," said the source, adding that the issue should be thrashed out at the international level.
Previously a member of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian in Strebel reported that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of tapped by the American secret services of the German chancellor.
Snowden ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow, or on the territory of Germany.
Ex-CIA officer, has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA, the US has blocked all his travel, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But to do this we need to clearly define the terms of his arrival, " said the Strebel TV channel Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how-will decide itself.
The US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked on the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which revealed the information about the secret operations of U.S. intelligence surveillance on the Internet.
Snowden flew in to Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport annulled the US authorities, in absentia to him serious charges, and to early August remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport.
On 1 August Snowden was given a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of a year and the same day he left Sheremetyevo."

Children must learn the myths and legends as "model of lifestyle," says the author.
Legends about the Torah would be to show that brute force can't win refined the trick," and the legends of King Arthur, show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will prove " too wild, too controversial and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools," Crossley-Holland stands for "careful selection" age appropriate texts.
"I think it is wonderful that in America the myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I stood for the introduction in the training program for twenty years.
He added that "excessive moralizing" authors and teachers "discouraging interest" in children, and the basic ideas of sublimated into a fascinating history.
The Crossley-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" with the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote " The Book of Norse myths " for publishers Penguin and British folk tales, " said: " You have, of course, can be, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between adult author, writer for adults, and adults by the author, writer for children, is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there was an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; solved through history, not clearly articulated.

Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia-consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and massive cuts in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.
The last time he entirely due to consumption, which almost does not ease the turnovers, " said chief economist for Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens box, representing yesterday quarterly report of Investbank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia-about 10%.
With inflation at 6 percent, he will be able to provide future consumer demand roughly at the current level, at Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so it is likely that they will optimize staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: If wages are rising by 10%, GDP is only 2%, " said Mr Field.
The company was faced with reduced profitability.
If it will not grow, it could lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.
Not to raise the salaries of Russian business can't, " said Barclays Capital chief economist for Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment is near historic lows, the competition for workers.
To lure employees from the side or to keep current, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is supported and very rapid growth of PatrickDelany.
According to Mr. Field, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country, this kind of lending is not.
"The benefit to the economy from growth of PatrickDelany we no saw money not diverge on the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem in the other-in Goldman Sachs expect growth of arrears on unsecured loans.
These are mainly poor people who have nothing to offer in.
The interest on such loans high.
As a result, they often do not return, " said Mr Field.
So the second threat to economic growth in Russia-a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.
The director of banking institute HSE Vasily Solodov already sees signs of a maturing of the banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, do not have access to cheap resources, has some of the state-owned banks, were forced to attract means from population at a high interest rate.
In response, the state-owned banks went on the warpath and began to reduce lending rates, says economist.
Small credit organization can not give loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margin.
If the state-owned banks will not abandon of dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solokov.
Deprivation of licenses of some banks in recent weeks, the economist believes the harbinger of mass crash.
"The state-owned banks with such a situation will not cope: The system of deposit insurance originally was not designed for a systemic crisis," warned the head of the Institute.
But consumption growth will slow and without crisis of non-payments, put in the investment bank, because of the refusal of indexing salaries of civil servants and the military, in the current version of the draft budget.
In part, the hit to consumption will be softened by the freeze tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, inflation).
But only partly: If the investments don't grow up (and preconditions to this no-see The Help), consumption growth will slow down, confidence in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital until sees no preconditions for implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the fall in oil prices," he says.
By his estimate, Russia's economy will begin to shrink with the cost of oil below $90 a barrel.
At Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is unable to lower interest rates in the economy.
There has been a paradoxical picture: Inflation has fallen, and banks began to raise rates.
It may mean that they did not believe the central bank, declaring the transition to the targeting inflation, " said Clemens column.
Interest rate policy of the central bank on market rates does not, only affects rates for interbank lending.
"For the central bank is the collapse of all hope," praised Clemens column.
Money received at auctions, the central bank, banks are not lending to the economy, and to manage their liquidity
As soon as the reduced rate, changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the rouble.
"Sooner or later, the central bank will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr Field and reminded that to let the ruble in "free swimming" the state plans by the end of 2015.
But will have to do this before, or to raise the key rate the central bank (5.5%), he says.
By his estimate, the ruble exchange rate now artificially inflated by 10%.
Ruble only one road-to weaken, " concludes the expert.
But if the central bank will Serenety in financiers even the shadow of a doubt that the elimination of currency corridor is not part of the policy by the weakening of the ruble, it can bring down the ruble is much stronger.

FAA: " Air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes (but not to call from your mobile phone)
The passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, to work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines, published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect that the changes will happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, " said FAA Administrator Michael worth at the press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA, as their planes meet new guidelines and that they update their textbook for the members of the flight crew and the rules on the installation of devices to conform to the new guidelines.
The FAA said that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already unveiled plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan we could approve the extension of the use of electronic devices very soon," said FAU.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain will not welcome.
Passengers must turn off their devices once again when a plane goes down for planting, and to not enable them, as long as the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes properly protected from electronic interference, can allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, said FAU.
The majority of new aircraft and other planes, modified in such a way that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.
The Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy will be safely implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier, to achieve this, it will be a safe choice, " said Glading.
We frankly are tired of feeling "duty at school," when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connection for web browsing, e-mails, text messages or downloading data will still be banned at the height of less than 10,000 feet, according to the agency.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in a mode of the aircraft.
Thus, there is still no "Words with Friends" - intellectual Internet games, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was the famous incident: The actor was removed from the aircraft the airline American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the plane was at the gate.
But heavier devices, such as laptops, still will need to be in the luggage department, because they can someone to injure, if will fly across the room.
Calls from the mobile phone in flight will also still prohibited.
Regulatory authority on telephone calls to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month Mark Rosenker from the National Council on transport security, national security expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered at risk.
"Cell phones-it really is a problem, not just because potentially it could create interference to navigational devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they can create interference for cell phone towers when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
Industry advisory committee created by the FAA to study this issue, recommended last month that the government has allowed a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, been growing pressure on the FAA with the aim of easing of restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as the Democrat senator from Missouri Claire the MacCaskill, argue that bans for no good reason related to security.
The observance of the restrictions also becomes more difficult to provide, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAA began to limit use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of fail for navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began to carry the FM-radio-high-tech gadgets at that time.
New airliners are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they also are being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
The airline to offer passengers using Wi-Fi at cruising altitude already for several years.
The planes, modified for Wi-Fi systems, also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, " said Worth.
Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals a much lower power than the previous generation devices.
Device for reading electronic books, for example, emit only a minimal signals when switching the pages.
But the signals are becoming more powerful when the device download or send data.
Among those who sought the easing of restrictions on the use by passengers of electronic devices was the company Amazon.com.
In 2011 the company representatives have downloaded a airliner with their devices for reading e-books on the Kindle and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices presents any risk.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers, said that he believes interference from devices real, even if the risk is minimal.
The other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages pilots, confirming that the devices might be creating interference for aviation systems, and most of these messages very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA allowed the pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during the landings on the devices in poor visibility.
A group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them sensible step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.

Vilnius suspects to Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to make informational provocations against high-ranking persons of Lithuania and countries of Eastern Partnership is such a statement to the agency BNS has made in the state security department of the Republic (DGB).
The information about this published on the portal Delfi.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "negotiate" with the president of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaite Dahl and publish falsified documents, allegedly found in Russian Gourgel that touch of facts from the biographies of Lithuanian leader.
According to the security services, the preparation of the information attack leads the Department analysis of public governance processes of the administration of the president of Russia for interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Merenkov, once visited Lithuania and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also a member of the operation allegedly is an employee of the department in Smirnov.
According to the Secret Service, Smirnov under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 were regularly arrived in Lithuania and in contact with local politicians, political scientists and representatives of the media.
Now Smirnova prohibited entry into the territory of the country.
On the eve of the president of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaite said that knows about her Informatica.
In her opinion, the main reason is a successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and "the aspiration of the country to energy independence."
The Lithuanian leader previously not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She stated that in the Kremlin to Lithuania are "insufficiently respectful."
In addition, Dalia Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin's nomination to Lithuania " alone requirements."

New antinational vaccine can deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed antinational vaccine, which could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life."
Further tests are needed before trials on humans, it will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the early results are encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a strategy of using vaccines can finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit, surrogate methods available in the market today, but they discovered that nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern tools," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was designed to carry genetic information for antinational of antibodies.
Selectively the virus infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies trail any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker nicotine hit.
In vaccinated mice, which subsequently gave the nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice that were not given the vaccine, " relaxed, " and this is an indication that the nicotine to the brain, " say the researchers.
These experiments described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccine failed, because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, the injections had to do so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it makes liver cells in the factories of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it would give the children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.

Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for what they sneaked hand baggage on board his flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday showed that the passengers will be able to keep the entire bank.
A new fee for baggage applies to bags in the overhead baggage compartments, so a small bags, placed under the seat remain free.
Frontier said it will charge $25, if the fee is payable in advance, and $100, if travelers will pay only once at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O Melli said that cost $100 to get the passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
Airlines have begun to charge for the first and second bag, checked in luggage, in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges, edge so much, how many will be able, in hand baggage in the overhead baggage compartments, resulting in these compartments are not enough.
Fees-one of the ways to get passengers to carry less on board.
O Melli said that this new collection, in fact, not for the sake of making money.
The fact is that the most loyal customers frontier say that to find a place in the overhead baggage compartments becomes increasingly difficult.
The passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, will have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier flight may get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the next in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
Mr. O Melli said that changes to procedures on the Web site and its frontier is meant to ensure that passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.
A new frontier for hand baggage will not be charged until the summer, though the date is not yet set.
The passengers often complain about fees for baggage and other fees, but airlines their love.
They argue that the processing of baggage costs money, and the passengers who need this service, need to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street believe adding a baggage fees a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of losses.
But most of them are not concerned the fees for carry-on luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. has introduced the first fee for carry-on luggage three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with this collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the additional fees.
By his estimate in the report from December 2011, the fee for carry-on baggage brings spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former senior manager at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Flight spirit, and he was wondering what he will find at the gate, where the passengers will face an unusual gathering spirit for hand luggage.
"The process of planting was the smooth of those that I have seen for his career in the airlines," he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing passed quickly."
Frontier also follows the spirit in the $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice, can leave all the bank and that Goliath coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will still be free to hand out water.
Us Airways short time was trying to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned that after seven months, after the passenger began to complain, and no other major airline not followed its example.
The initiative frontier on charging for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is it the latest measure to attract customers to its Web site.
Airlines pay online sellers of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
It gave to all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, not to turn in on-line travel agency.
All but frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began to give two times less frequent flyer miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday she cut the bonus number of miles up to 25 percent of the miles of travel.
So, the trip to 1,000 miles from the frontier, were purchased from online travel agencies, would get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the frontier.
The frontier has a base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but its business is declining and unprofitable.
Revenues decreased by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to improve finances frontier in the framework of the sale of the airline.

Putin has made of impunity for his friend Assad
And now the news because of the ocean-namely, from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel has dealt a blow to Russian missiles, which reportedly was meant "to Hezbollah."
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition is to destroy the November 1 its production of chemical weapons.
It was done in the framework of an agreement reached under the mediation of Russia and the United States not to carry out a military operation to which they closely came this summer.
Read more about weapons and about what all this means for the Syrian president, will tell our Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of U.S. bombing, and in the form of the transaction, which was a friend of Assad-Vladimir Putin.
Syria give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The group of international experts, reported that Syria has declared the factories for the production from 1999.
More long-term and difficult task-the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand, this is about a thousand tons.
Previously, Washington said that Assad's days are numbered.
I believe that Assad must go.
The question is not if this will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels more confident.
His forces are still using artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents divided and poorly armed.
His people forced to leave their homes, many go hungry.
Some people have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for a mass murder.
An agreement on chemical weapons are called success of diplomacy, the inspectors awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself was impressed with the man, ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador in Syria had to answer tough questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is hardly easier from the fact that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is held.
And changes the weapons on power.

Parents visibly intersex children can choose "uncertain" floor"
Germany became the first European country that has recognized the third floor of children born with external sex organs intermediate type.
Newborn will no longer be necessarily attributed to male or female gender.
The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify gender as uncertain or unknown in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about the newborn's gender, and to counter discrimination visibly intersex people.
One visibly intersex people, according to the BBC, said many years later: "I am not a man and a woman."
I will remain created by doctors patchwork product with bruises and scars.
About one in two thousand children, charities each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have the intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological states that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development " - the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, Honda (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed external sex organs.
Wallace Simpson, perhaps, was a intersexual.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the US say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information to assign it than to wait and monitor psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all, it will happen.
New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Visibly intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but most children don't have them," he said.
You can assign to the floor without surgery and then to see how developed a personality.
The science about how the child will develop any gender identity, not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are gay.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes visibly intersex people as different from transgender or transgender because the state has less to do with gender, and to their biological structure which is neither exclusively male nor female sex, and typical of both at once or not is for one of them.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gives a general idea of the discrimination that confronts visibly intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes of prejudice.
Boys with gender variations now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal has already allowed adults to be male, female or "third gender" in its official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia this year, Welby became the first man in the world, recognized asexual, upheld in court the right to maintain an indefinite sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in German passports will be the third rohace in addition to the M and F-X, is visibly intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still arouse controversy, according to a news release on the channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this strongly Catholic country, signed a petition on the "gender theory" from school textbooks.
American Web site Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation when the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity-no, we Pereverzeva two more pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Web site baby zone that she would have preferred that the children have sex at birth.
"Raising a child is difficult and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child," she said the Web site for parents.
The children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex organs, called androgyne-named handsome Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And yet just ten years ago the medical community perceive gender as a leaf on which all you can wipe, and then again to draw.
But now many disputed ethical reason for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes makes the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to the floor when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called " urgent psychiatric case, " said Drescher.
When these children were born, you called Not the psychiatrist-you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to treat children with genitalia intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Mani from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender easily amenable to change.
He introduced the term "gender identity" and argued that the signals of the environment, including the social-how parents raise a child, interact with genes and hormones child, determining whether a person is considered to be a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as the "John/Joan," his theories were called into question.
He told the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during a sloppy circumcision, fully to castrate child, removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Mani has presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but this was not the case," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he was a boy and married to a woman.
But in the 38 years he committed suicide.
The Drescher said that today, some doctors are still "apply this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who experienced these operations to change sex, declared himself, "dissatisfied with the result."
Such was the case and Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but with the genitals of intermediate type.
Doctors were unable to pinpoint whether there has been a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he will never be able to live "full life" men.
So soon after his birth in 1976 external sexual organ and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl.
He began to give women hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew that I'm not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
In the 18 years he was appointed the vaginoplasty.
But while in depression and understanding that something is wrong, he demanded a medical documentation.
What he learned, it was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development, which didn't give his body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of genitals.
After learning the truth, he again became the man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing their breasts.
The operation made him infertile.
Today he is in defense of others in the organization called Interface Project, trying to bring in the normal perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California Association of Legal Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "encourages to labels and the stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and to give the child " undetermined sex, " she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.
We believe that it is better to a male or female gender, then to wait.
But we have not yet seen, how will this law, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third floor."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexual identity," she says.
The German law implies its assigned at birth.
It is a battle, in which young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr son the Baratz, mammolist radiologist from Pittsburgh, which has a daughter with sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law "will support" as parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a disorder of sexual development under the name "syndrome of full P.O. to androgens."
Because its androgenic receptors incorrect work, Kathy developed female characteristics.
She has her vagina, but not of the uterus and ovaries.
Now, at 29, Katie is married and a residency in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent via adoption or gestational surrogacy motherhood.
"The law gives parents the time to not take any hasty decisions themselves," said Bartz.
He gives them time to do some tests and to understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they would be male or female.
In this case you in order-and raise the child, love child.
You have a lovely child, and you feel the joy.
We don't need to quickly do the operation, which is irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the emotion, which is driven by parents, because they don't feel that doing the right thing," she said.
In the end the child will decide how Paul him or her more comfortable, and it is wonderful.
This gives the children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.

Court has suspended the execution of decisions on the practice of "stop-and-search " in the New York Police Department
On Thursday the Court of Appeal Federal District has suspended enforcement of a court ruling requiring changes to stop-and-search " of the New York Police Department, and has suspended the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the US said that the execution of decisions judges Shira Sheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution in how he carried out a programme of detention and interrogation.
The city has appealed her decision and issued a corrective measures, including an order to appoint the controller to help police station to change practices and related training program.
On Thursday the Court of Appeal heard the debate of the parties on the request to suspend.
The appeals court stated the need to remove judges because she had breached the code of conduct of U.S. judges and 1863 with the need to avoid demonstrations of bias, in part because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing public response to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people unnecessarily referring to blacks and Latinos under the program "Stop-and-search."
She was appointed as the external supervisor to oversee large-scale changes that include the reforms in the field of policies, training and monitoring, and decided to run a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in police stations, where most of the arrests.
In August, New York-came to the decision to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people, which were discontinued after police checks.
Debate on the appeal of the city should be held after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of "stop and search " was criticised by many lawyers on civil rights.
"Stop-and-search" practiced for decades, in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased sharply under the administration of an independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching in 2011 of absolute record 684 330 people, most of them blacks and Latinos.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed in court a collective action.
Supporters of the changes in the program "Stop-and-search" in the New York Police Department said that these changes will end the unfair practice, will generate more reliable and efficient police service and could affect how other departments police implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will lower the morale of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police because of the reduction in the number of officers on several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that it does not stop the practice of "stop-and-search," which complies with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stops of people.

Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after the signing of the association with the EU
The prime minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will be considerably lower after the country will sign an association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this in the course of conversation with readers of their pages on Facebook."
I can definitely tell you that prices are determined by many factors, including, among others, and customs duties.
Now, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on free trade area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be considerably lower.
And it will mean that prices should fall further.
"It is with regard to goods that come from the EU," wrote Azarov.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there also should not be raising prices.
Therefore, messages on billboards, which in recent years many have appeared in our country that association with the EU is rising prices, it's not quite true, or more precisely to speak-not so, " - summed Mr. Azarov.

The rescue package of $325 million for Tasmania's Health
The federal government insists that the rescue package of $325 million for weakened health systems Tasmania will be complemented by severe conditions that guarantee that the state government would not spend money wasted.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.
The decision on funding for four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed a package of emergency relief measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems, standing in front of the state," said Ms. Plibersek.
The package of $325 million includes $31 million on a campaign blitz on routine operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and undergoing surgery to remove cataracts, will help to overcome a backlog.
There is also money for clinics, patients without prior records in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care at the hospital, training medical professionals, mental health services and implementation of systems of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals.
"These investments will be made by leading doctors to implement ideas about how best to help the health system Tasmania," said Ms. Plibersek.
The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania, will work in the strict accountability and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain the current levels of funding in order to get the money to the Commonwealth, and monthly report about where he spends such additional funds.
Will be created a commission of three people to make sure the state provides the services as efficient and effective.
Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million nothing will decide "if will not follow the real reform that would put the health system Tasmania on a more sustainable basis."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for a response to its request for urgent aid, with which he first turned to the prime minister in early May.
"I hope that the package of federal assistance will significantly contribute to the conclusion of the health care system of this state from critical states," said Mr. Wilke.
According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement represents a " solution, similar to face."
"The reason we are here is that the Labour government of the state pulled out $430 million from the health system, " he told the ABC TV.
When the government lifts the state of almost half a billion dollars, and the commonwealth is investing $300 million, you can't pretend that this is good news.
Mr Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no one dollar from the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The cry of despair of Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change
He says that Obama has allowed the obstructionism of Republicans to nullify laudable efforts.
The obstructionism can't serve as an excuse for problems with the Web site reformulate Obama health systems, Attack of the drones
Memoirs about the Obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been
The Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at the medical faculty of Harvard University.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought that this book will inspire me in a time of gloom on the second course of medical faculty and will revive in me a sense of hope.
It's called " The Audacity to Win, " and it is a memoir about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finished the evening to write the reports according to my patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when the policy inspired millions of people, and the performances could capture the spirit.
Victory in the elections was impressive, and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historical moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents I did all newspapers, which only they could find.
The White House was supposed to come to a young team of strategists, and the nation was ready to change.
At the time of Obama into office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
The return at present is a rude awakening, as Wudeluene from dreams.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism-they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years that have passed since I cast my first ballot, the changes really happened.
It was something that I even could not imagine.
I give Obama credit for its large and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on available medical care until the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, " killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked many attempts to move our country forward: Immigration reform, the choice of a public health care and closing bases in Guantanamo, among others.
But after countless number of times, when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I have ended the explanation that I can provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
The obstructionism of the Republicans can't explain permission to wiretap foreign leaders or strikes by drones on innocent children in other countries.
He can't explain the data collection about the private lives of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of whistleblower, revealing improper actions of the government.
He could not explain the killing of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaign.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which says that attach the White House efforts to silence the media, are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And the last time he can't justify that fails to create a simple Web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on available medical care.
I don't know, if I was to be expected.
Should I was at the age of 18 years to understand that the leadership may contradict to political campaigns, preconstruction?
It is obvious, that the work on elective office is not predictable programme of action, because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and such random events, like the massacre in Newtown.
Yet all my examples listed above, you can see that they were largely by his own choice of the administration.
And this is what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a strange and an alternative, it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on their own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term Obama, freed from the constraints of future elections, will justify the hopes, about which we have heard for so long.
However, when this week, Obama's approval rating has dipped below 45%, to return to 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.
It makes me homesick for many promises that was gone.
This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton has dealt Obama a resounding defeat in a primary election in Pennsylvania.

In Egypt takes the oath the first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath, but the day of its celebrations is unlikely to Znamenov an end of political struggle in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt," when he was sworn in, becoming the first freely elected president, Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in the court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life-absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization, which served as a target for tough actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers, when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered near the courthouse, to welcome a new president, and, unlike the presidential pumps in the time of Mubarak, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was derided as uncharismatic " spare wheel "brothers," his personal prestige has surged since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only Islamists, but also to all those who want to end the uprising of 2011 against Mubarak's authoritarian.
"Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges are encased in the panelled hall, where he has taken the oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with military orchestra, who performed the national anthem, during which he stood to attention.
Attended a military figure is Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was greeted with the slogan "the army and the people are one hand," chanted the hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, a Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising began, completed the authoritarian Mubarak's rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, which his office was deprived the military council who took the case from the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take the oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Speech Morsi in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.

Schools urged to pay more attention to the math, spelling and grammar
High school English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, Romantic poetry and modern British art literature since 1914.
The exam will also be presented "vneprogrammnymi texts" to encourage broader reading.
The combined English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, pupils will be obliged to take a final exam on the tongue, with persistent recommendations of English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education should tomorrow to release new training programs for English and maths-the subjects, subjected to radical revision.
He will have to make changes in other major items in the next year.
Separately, the regulatory body in the sphere of Ofqual exams will present a revised structure of final exams high school, with a new system of assessments and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that was "reached a broad consensus that we need to reform our system of examinations to restore public confidence," insisting that high school graduation exams would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Research shows that English schools devote less time mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours per week in the quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison-Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, pupils are engaged about 138 hours.
Although formal demands to spend more time in the schedule mathematics will not be, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics in combination with an increased coefficient table ratings, are likely to serve as an incentive for providing schools with extra training on this subject.
In educational plan more attention will be paid to the tasks of real life, " including financial mathematics.

Football-the cause strife?
In the State Duma in the "Open tribune" politicians and pundits have been talking about how to preserve peace in Russia.
Among the proposals sounded and this: To ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game-some scandals and discord.
The Speaker Sergei Naryshkin reminded about recent events in Biryulevo and said that to reduce the degree of tension in society," politicians and media should be valid in the statements.
Perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir, who in one of the television threatened to encircle the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they don't want to limit birth rates...
All the speakers talked about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations between peoples inhabiting Russia that gave the debate a sobornost.
Maxim Grigoryev said that events in Biryulevo - "the conflict that it was possible to predict" but "these questions we have answers too many people and the authorities," and many a child without eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time in relation to migrants practiced Europe, according to the itinerary, failed, and we need to find its way.
The historian Yuri Petrov has high hopes on a new unified history textbook.
"We have to create a textbook on the history and culture of the peoples of the country, schoolchildren in Tatarstan knew that for people living in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov offered to introduce criminal responsibility for " appeals to dismember Russia: " If the United States to say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you are arrested and will give 20 years of prison Aneckstein which"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky worked very hard "not to stoke."
As usual, he accused journalists who are sick and acute national problems at a public debate: "In the heat of the debate knows what to say Aneckstein which"
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised reporters to sign a "charter" and agree to talk on the subject carefully, and then the same obligations can take on and politics.
We have taken about 30 of the laws that regulate migration, and the order in general is installed, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that imposes on the regional and municipal authorities responsible for international peace on their territory.
But Ludmila Andrienko delight about this law has not divided: There are no " clear idea about what is the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
It means that actors will interpret differently the volume of these powers.
In addition, municipalities no personnel needed to address such complex issues, no money, and methodical recommendations, which they could use, they don't give...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities Gajimet Safaraliev offered to create a special office with formidable name " to the ministry of national security," which dealt with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s was led by a similar agency, abolished later, opposed it.
It is enough to have at the federal level, a special person, " minister without portfolio," to which one might ask, if that.
"We are on the edge, shells screaming, it is very important to the representatives of different ethnic groups and religions together to oppose provocations, and this work must get decent information support," said a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church on relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin.
No neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, religious, including, to be, in his opinion, should not.
Then Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, another to need, but their push on the road, not on the road," he said.
"The Road " is the development of football: " Football player beaten all crowd, the burning flags, comrades with stones throw each other...
Maybe don't need us such a football?
There is another kind of sport-rugby is called...
"Equally, they will not be in the world in this sport Aneckstein all" - hotly spoke prioress.
In rugby in the Caucasus, no one to play will not be Aneckstein which-immediately intervened, Mr Zhirinovsky.
You still curling them will offer Aneckstein Research
Need to know about identity, it's still that the Georgians "Zaporozhets" to offer ..."
In Yaroslavl wild behavior in the stands has different representatives of the Moscow club during the game with local club.

Recognition of the National Security Agency's increasing paranoia of corporations against government surveillance
Warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Service for the protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence, his assignment was to photograph the roof of the building of the United States, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV had hoped to discover antennas listening devices, and these actions had entailed negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of national intelligence in the US in September, again assured that the United States does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who resolutely-began to publish its treasure trove of intelligence secrets to the United States, European governments and leaders of companies no longer sure whether to trust the director on the word.
Reports that the National Security Agency in the United States watched the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored, providers of cloud services, including Google and Yahoo, has raised paranoia corporations, caused by the surveillance state, to new heights.
The last straw was the news that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel auditioned, probably about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, potential targets are and business leaders.
Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the United States and companies.
I think it is likely that these data are used by a mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver of Gruen, president of bitmi Association, which represents small and medium IT company in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the United States now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
All documents, pursued by Mr Snowden, however, so far there was no evidence that the United States has handed over to commercial secrets of foreign companies in their own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks specific opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that he should try to reduce their dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament, says that we must create German Google.
I can only close his eyes and slowly to open them again...
"This is not an option," says the Hasso Plattner, president of the German company-the software provider for Business SAP.
If there is a necessity for a powerful European IT industry, should not allow her to die more than 20 years ago.
All subsidized in Germany: From coal to cars and farmers.
All, except the IT industry.
And yet the scope and the technical and agencies on US spying, which became famous thanks to the Snowden revelations, was a shock for some of the companies that used to be thought that the biggest risk of surveillance is China.
A big shift is happening in the cloud technologies, where leaders of European companies better realized that data stored in the United States, are located in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to the study conducted by a trade association of Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-US members had abandoned plans to use the services of the US-based cloud provider after revelations of American data mining programme Prism.
Jim Snabe, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: "We are seeing that consumers are asking a question that was not there a year ago, namely: Where are my data and can you guarantee that they physically will remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that the last message-this is just confirmation of what they already knew: Powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and hence this data must be protected at all costs.
What is the economic espionage, " it is not surprising.
He always had a place.
"It was a subject of discussion for many years and not changed substantially in the current controversy," says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company BASF.
Americans spying for us on the commercial and industrial level, and we also spying for them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Leaders of corporations typically do not like to boast of those retaliatory measures that they have taken, as this may give an advantage to the enemy.
In large companies have long been internalized the idea that to take a free USB flash drive at the exhibition or leave a laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least imprudent.
Ulrich's Hackenberg, member of the Board of Directors of automotive company Audi, said that for many years it is standard practice to collect mobile phones before meetings of the board so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The Federal Service for the protection of the Constitution, Germany recommends that managers of companies to consider the possibility of using a pre-paid mobile phone during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
A prepaid mobile phones later perception.
Nevertheless, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the global market in their particular niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," warns the report BfV.
The United States warn their own company on economic espionage from other countries.
National intelligence summary USA in February put France, together with Russia and Israel in the second series of offenders who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, says the Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German companies confirmed that when talking about economic espionage, "the French are the worst of all."
Bernard of Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency the DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The service know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spying on their allies."

The Kenyan press indignant provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there are reasons for the question: What can prevent destruction of the parliament and the independence of the judiciary in the future?," said the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is a very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus, Kamau, managing director of Capital Group-the parent company capitalfm, which includes one of the most respected in Kenya of independent radio stations and news site.
He said that a new judicial authority on the media " will always be biased, since it is a continuation of the government, " and the limitations of content and advertising will hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the president will listen to us, and we turn to him with a request to withdraw the bill and return it to the deputies," he said.
According to the newspaper the Star, the new law would essentially allow the government "to take media stranglehold," and the Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "has received a serious blow," and criticized the bill as draconian.
The adoption of the bill is part of measures taken to enhance national security after the September attacks Muslim terrorists in the Westgate shopping centre.
Kenyan media have angered the authorities, transliterate records of surveillance cameras, where troops that were sent to the scene of the attack, allegedly rob expensive shopping centre.
The reaction of police chief David Kimaiyo became a call two journalists and officials of the media for questioning, although the call was canceled after protests broke out in the media.

After the accusations of Durnovaria Eugenia Vasilieva began
Eugenia Vasilieva, to the person that almost a year on media attention, has still never been commented on numerous publications in the press as a theft in the Defense Ministry, and about her personally-Relations with the ex-Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and passion about the valuable things.
But on 1 November the figurant case "Oboronservis" broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev said: "Originally, of course, the task was exactly one: To pull out of me any negative information about the former secretary of defense."
Was blackmail on the subject that I have to give evidence, otherwise they will put me in jail.
Today, these threats stopped.
Then we go to court, we are going to prove his innocence.
In the victory we are sure 100 percent.
At the same time from an interview I can make the conclusion that, perhaps, most Vasilieva hit that she has no matter with taste.
Probably, in a statement, the official representative of the RF Vladimir Markin, that the collection of paintings, which collected the figurant case "Oboronservis," was a forgery.
Among the arrested property there are a number of pictures that Hostess, being confident in their deep knowledge of art, had acquired as masterpieces of world art.
But art expert appointed by investigators after arrest of these pictures, and found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap counterfeits, " Markin said in early October.
Some paintings, stolen from the Ministry of Defence.
Then finally acknowledged that they were not stolen from the Defense Ministry, meanwhile, told me that bad with taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it's just an outrage, " says Vasiliev.
On the question of whether she admits their guilt although in one of 12 Benjamin her criminal episodes, Vasiliev said: " Of course not.
To nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no damage of the Russian Federation, we're talking about.
Simply enter the people, and that's all.
In addition, in response to today's announcement of the RF SC that Vasilieva shies away from the study of the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of Figurado said that he and his client " investigator does not meet with the materials of the case."
That has caused to the revelations under house arrest Vasilieva, still not communicating with the press?
Perhaps, as a woman, she has not been able to answer the charge in bad taste?
Or right journalists " Komsomolskaya Pravda, claimed a couple of days ago, that she " in even greater trans under house arrest " over News of the reconciliation Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and in his return to the bosom of the family?
Known military observer "KP" Victor Barnes in his article " Serdyukov returned to his wife? "Wrote:" Investigators do not rule out that after such turmoil it may become more talkative on the interrogation."
Earlier Vasiliev some accusations of illegal sale of real estate of defense took upon themselves.

The HS2 high-speed project involves opening the message with Scotland and the North of England, with the onset of the first stage in IFC's year
The transport minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project "will unite Britain."
Scotland's transport minister Keith Brown said he was "delighted" at the prospect of working on a plan with the government of the UK.
The first stage will be to build a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When completed the second phase of the line will be built in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government has revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed line between London and the North of England with £ inlaid to £ 42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is leading the talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to consider further improve throughput railways and reducing the length of trips to northern England and Scotland.

We are developing HS2 because the benefits that it will bring, huge.
Without him we will face with the crisis capacity in our rail network.
But the speech also comes to transport links cities with each other; across the UK 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best message with HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown, urged Mr. Carmack unequivocally support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "High-speed railways has all chances to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in general arguments for a high-speed railroad across the UK."
So we are pleased to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options for the construction of high-speed railways in Scotland, creating benefits for all and the continuation of railway line Glasgow-Edinburgh, which already plans to the Scottish government.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers in the next year and a decision on next steps.

In the case of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, unrest in Kopacki colony-it is through ONC receive the most resonant incidents behind bars.
For control of the ONC is the struggle between human rights activists and lobbyists of the security forces.
At the meeting of the working group, to create the ONC I offered to do the criterion of selection experience human rights work.
"He was not accepted, and lists, not ViraNative criteria," says Valery Borshev.
The Borshev-the current chairman of the Moscow Supervisory Commission and Association of independent observers-all structure of human rights defenders in prison problems.
When a deputy of the Duma from "apple" he has developed a law regulating the ONC.
The council chamber must vote for compositions ONC in 43 regions of the country.
At 1800 vacant places claim less than thousands of people, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria contests failed to organise because of a lack of candidates.
Bing promises to organize donor on vacant seats.
ONC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that the new structure instead of 20 will be 40 participants.
According to Barewa, the current composition of the commission's 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces and, in the case, which is on the ballot in PR, the ratio changes on 17 to 23.
While in the commission wanted to get 30 human rights defenders.
But the new structure may re-enter the representative of military Brotherhood Vyacheslav Kalinin.
For three years was a member of the ONC, but never visited prisoners.
The Borshev believes that the security forces, appointing its chairman ONC, will be able to do the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so defenders do not rule out a collective way out of commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of the siloviki coordinates member ONC Anton Flowers, who runs "the officers of Russia" - an organization defending the interests of the security forces.
"I don't eat babies for breakfast," said RBC Daily Anton flowers.
He denies that lobby the promotion of any lists and says that is not going to prevent human rights defenders to visit detained opposition activists.
According to 1972, he did not even interested in, for what the list now vote in Pr.
The disclosure Borsheim information he believes a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders-the change of leadership Chelyabinsk ONC.
Its former executives will be pushed aside because Kopacki last year's unrest.
The Public Chamber came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here's the ONC Rostov-on-Don can pass from human rights activists by the security forces.
From the new lists "disappeared," human rights activist-the chairman of the local committee, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 Federal Public Chamber ruled out him for unethical behavior.
The lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions the Borshev believes "revenge for Kopeisk."
Revelations of hope the Tolokonnikova did not affect ONC of Mordovia, which believe power: In a new staff wanted to get only one human rights activist, and she has not even made the documents for the competition.
A member of the board, Nikolai Svanidze, told RBC Daily that voted against the proposed list, as his resent the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
His position he sent to other members of the board.
His colleague on the op Pavel Gusev says that he voted for, because he likes offered Moscow list.
Coordinated draw up lists of ONC deputy secretary, Vladislav mushroom, who is also a researcher at the Research Institute of FSIN.
Mushroom told RBC Daily that he did not believe the right to divide candidates for human rights activists and security forces and do not agree that chairmen of commissions enough powers to prevent the work of its members.
The fungus is not to predict the outcome of the vote of the council.
If the proposed list today will be rejected in the coming days on the vote will make the changed version.

NSA blames " internal error' rather than hackers in the termination of the work site
Secret National Security Agency said Friday night that the termination of the work of their website for a few hours was caused by a technical failure, not hackers, as affirmed in the network.
"Nsa.gov was inaccessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," said an intelligence agency official in the e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS], is wrong.
Earlier tonight online monitoring system servers have registered that the NSA had not worked for at least six hours, and the website is still inaccessible for some users.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that inner secret network of the agency "by no means" was hacked.
No classified information is not in danger, the official said.
At least one online-a group of hackers and activists said that she is responsible for the failure of the NSA with DDoS attacks.
DDoS attacks designed to explode in the target website with traffic until the servers not be overloaded and website not go out of order.
Tactics hackers relatively simple, and the attacks are not intended for penetration into the internal network of the target system.
Earlier Super NSA, formerly nicknamed " No Such Agency," appeared in recent months in the centre of public attention and fierce criticism after revelations of its vast surveillance programs abroad and within the country-all this is a reaction to the secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by disenchanted former NSA employee Edward Snowden with.
The growing controversy around the agency has caused nothing that today's incident was the result of deliberate actions by hackers.

Head of Gazprom Alexei Miller said that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The beginning of construction of the gas pipeline "South Stream" in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
"Today is a landmark event: Began construction of the Bulgarian section of the gas pipeline" South Stream," the large-scale and important project in Europe, " said the chairman of Gazprom Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security of the European continent.
"South Stream is designed for diversification of export routes Russia through Europe.
A dispute over a contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which is most of the intended for European gas Russia, increases the level of risk for regular routes, say officials.
Miller said that direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries removed forever.
The Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price, once in 2015, the whole project will begin to work.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries, further along the route of the pipeline, by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

The agency Rosbalt was stripped of the status of media for abuse
On October 31, the Moscow City Court ruled to annul the license registration agency Rosbalt, "writes" the tape."
The prison agency status of media insisted Roskomnadzor, systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media.
In the course of the process was created a nasty precedent: The court decided to close the media, effectively denying the right to nominate counter-arguments.
What is the "Rosbalt"
CJSC "news agency Rosbalt" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency has opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
Also, the agency operates offices in countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001 the "Rosbalt" was developed and operated as a federal information-analytical news agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
While the "Rosbalt" always took very specific niche: The nucleus of exclusive publications of the agency were (and are still) notes with a reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talk about the proximity of the security forces continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that the "Rosbalt" had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions was saying and what the head of the project was Natalia Chaplin-the wife of Viktor Cherkesov's.
The role of Chaplin in leadership "Rosbalt" up to the end not clear: More often than not it is known as the "head of the project."
The director general of the agency is Larisa Afonin, editor-in-chief-Nikolay Ulyanov.
The last time the "Rosbalt" did not appear in the ratings federal media-neither the quote, nor the audience.
In October the agency ranked 25th in the rankings of attendance of Russian media on version of clicks.
According to the same clicks, the average daily audience of site Rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views) a month-about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials over the past five months-notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of lead singer of group King and jester," pogroms in metropolitan Biryulevo.
The conflict "Rosbalt" Roscomnadzor started in July 2013 when entered into force of the amendment to the media law, which banned journalists abuse.
The agency discovered the forbidden vocabulary in two published on the website of the videos (" got from Krasnodar "and" Pussy Riot has desecrated oil rigs ").
Further the parties describe differently.
Roskomnadzor based on found material has accused the "Rosbalt" gross and systematic violation of media law and went to court with a demand to deprive the agency's license.
In "Rosbalt" stated that claims of unlawful: First, the videos were not editorial content, secondly, Materne words in them were masked, and thirdly, immediately after the videos were removed from the site.
The agency appealed against claims of Roscomnadzor in World Court-and when 22 October 2013, the Moscow city court has accepted a lawsuit (Roskomnadzor), the examination of these complaints still continued.
However, the magistrate decided not in favor of "Rosbalt ": Editor-in-chief Nicholas Ulyanov was convicted in violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles-10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, it was foreordained and the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court-to abandon the idea that the outcome could be decided even earlier.
On 31 October, the court took the decision to annul a certificate of registration of the "Rosbalt," effectively depriving the agency of mass media.
That is not to say that the "Rosbalt" during this confrontation remained in solitude.
The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (the statement in the name of the head of Roscomnadzor Alexander Gerova October 10 signed 26 deputies; the document was filed on the initiative of the CPRF).
Consider closing the magazine claimed the head of the Russian Union of Journalists, Vsevolod Bogdanov, president of the Moscow journalists' union Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential human rights council, Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roscomnadzor even gave him some guarantee that to withdraw the license deal would not go.
The trial "Rosbalt" showed: Under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a mass of information in Russia today is the big question.

Gene speech turned out to be a stimulant of the synapses of
Scientists from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Mount Sinai has discovered a protein, which "gene for speech" FOXP2 carries out its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study published in Science, on the website of the magazine, you can read him a summary.
FOXP2 gene is the first known genome, the function of which is directly associated with speech.
To establish his role managed in 2001 thanks to the discovery of the family from several people who were unable to correctly pronounce words and sometimes even themselves did not understand each other.
Scientists have found that a family member was the FOXP2 gene, but how it performs its function, was not known.
In the new study, the biologists have shown that at least part of their functions FOXP2 performs as a stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with the formation of speech.
Is it thanks to another gene, srpx2.
Last was discovered as a result of the search for the factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
Srpx2 turned out to be one of 10 such genes, the authors found, with only its activity feet FOXP2.
What srpx2 really affects sound, scientists confirmed in experiment on the pups.
When animals, the gene activity was artificially lowered, they shouted when sharing with his mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, was recovering and the frequency of the sounds.
Previously the mice was also shown a link with the sound of the FOXP2.
The animals, which introduced a human gene, pishchal more and at a lower rate than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know is whether the FOXP2 work and, accordingly, they managed srpx2 purely mechanical properties of education sounds or more delicate processes.

Want luminous in the dark ice cream?
The British entrepreneur has created the world's first glowing in the dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of marine animal, to develop a food.
He came to this idea, having read scientific article about the jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China chemically to recreate glowing protein.
Ice cream comes in reaction with language that it eats, increasing the pH of the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that since ice cream begins to glow when reacts to the warmth of the mouth, this means that the more you licking, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the company producing ice cream "Lisot me, I'm good," says: "This is an incredible thing, but still at the initial stage, if you talk about production, so for £ 200, you get about 2 grams of substance."
Protein that we use in ice cream, enters the reaction with your language with a neutral pH.
So, when your mouth will warm the protein, this will raise the pH level and ice cream will start to glow.
We tested it over the past few months, and it seemed that ideally would represent him in Halloween, because it creates such a remarkable effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice creams from those that I did, because the jellyfish luminescence four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball cost me about £ 140.
But it's quite pleasant to the taste.
Pilot Charlie Company, based in Bristol, famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste the gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said: "I very much want to develop invisible ice-cream."
It is by definition impossible because of the refraction, caused by ice crystals, which is ice-cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice-cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized Chinese scientists

Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany in question relating to U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden the U.S. intelligence, said that he is ready to go to Berlin to give a statement to the German parliament, if the National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander will not be able to answer questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Strebel on Thursday met with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum to discuss his testify in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP has presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: "Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements criminal charges, not giving any protection."
But to tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Mr. Snowden has said that he believes that the support of the international community can convince the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges, brought by the Ministry of Justice in the United States, include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to talk with German officials, we will find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have become strained after claims that the NSA listened to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, MP, who chairs the parliamentary group of the intelligence service, said that if there is a possibility to listen to Mr. Snowden as witness, " not exposing its dangers and not breaking relations with the United States fully," it should be used.
Mr Strebel, a member of parliament from the Green Party in Germany, has published his picture with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter feed.
During a visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Strebel said that, according to the lawyer of former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden gave testimony in Germany, he would need a guarantee that he will be there "in security," said the MP.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced "tough and sustained" campaign of persecution that has forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global reaction to "his political statements."
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials-including in the United States-found the exposure of uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."

The Italian workers with experience give way to young
The Italian unemployment hits record.

So bad was not matter since the Second World War.
Among the young this figure is higher in several times.
40.4% of people aged 15 to 24 years of age do not have employment.
The opinion of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions of this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
So I already operates the largest energy company in the country, and adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide part of early retirement for workers with experience.
However, on the other hand Italy waiting for Europe the problem of an ageing population.

Syria has destroyed the equipment for from 1999
Syria has destroyed all the declared facilities for production of chemical weapons, has acknowledged the organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This is the first phase of disarmament Damascus finished for the day of the deadline.
Until 1 November, Syria was supposed to destroy industrial and other auxiliary objects designed for warfare agents to use, reports the BBC.
The destruction of stockpiles of toxic agents or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, currently toxic substances are in sealed repositories.
International inspectors went to Syria after on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August in the chemical attack were killed, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people.
The main task of the inspectors was not to lose time-to not allow Syrian authorities to produce more from 1999-and destroy infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipment ammunition.
These capacity will now be carefully watched to prevent their repairs.
The next milestone-the middle of November: This time the OPCW and Syria must agree a detailed plan for destroying existing stockpiles of toxic agents.
Questions here a lot.
Where they will be destroyed?
Who will provide for this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services.
They readily will advise inspectors new objects for testing, if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not the end of Frank.
The US believe that this attack was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the hands of the Syrian rebels.
The international community urged the Syrian leadership-in accordance with the agreement brokered by Russia-to destroy or result in inoperable all capacity for the production of shells, toxic gases and liquids and for filling munitions with these substances.
Now, when this phase passed, the next step should be to destroy existing Syrian army from 1999.
It is envisaged that Arsenal could be more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, skin-Neringa mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored at dozens of different places.
For its destruction requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to start agreed timetable of action-it is two weeks.
The head of field operations, the OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally oversaw the destruction of the equipment."
"They have now no opportunity to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.
In a statement the OPCW said that inspectors had visited 21 of 23 sites in Syria and has become convinced that the factories on manufacture of shells and toxic substances or destroyed, or are ruined.
The remaining two objects is too dangerous to carry out an inspection, according to the document, but the equipment was transported from there and inspected by specialists of the OPCW.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of the infrastructure for the production from 1999 was "particularly difficult" because we had to work in conditions of the continuing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the OPCW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, time to celebrate that inspectors have so far not found-they were too busy with work.

George Kerevan: Gap with Europe gives Scots the choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time we warn that an independent Scotland would have to join the European zone of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
Then comes the stories about the passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrionova shaft.
True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits of free movement across the rest of Europe, though-what's predictable-it has not appeared in the headlines.
One pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as it suits them.
Because Scotland now is not included in the Schengen area, the continuation of the compliance requirements will become cheap concession of Brussels in return for what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not deserving of attention the story.
And so old that she turned into a fossil: I first heard gossip about what "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the retelling of the old fairytale.
Why an independent Scotland should fulfill the orders of Europe?
Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
The real European news: The great post-war plan to unify Europe finally has stalled.
With eurocrisis project "Europe" is officially dead.
Across the European Union of parties opposed to the EU or the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the party of the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, founded this year alone-appeared out of nowhere and got almost five million votes at the September federal election, thus essentially replacing "the Free Democrats" (the equivalent of our " Liberal Democrats ") from the Bundestag.
There was always the internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis became a turning point.
Austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, has led many people to the idea that the project "Europe" has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments work with excessive budget deficits, this was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members on exchange rates, favourable for German exporters, " that German politicians and want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency southern Europe is already at a disadvantage in terms of production capacity in comparison with Germany.
The only thing saving tool-to cut wages and government spending that actively supported by Berlin.
For the current budget problems and currency lies a deeper problem of productive capacity of Europe.
As a result of green energy measures, implemented by Brussels, is a cipher, meaning the subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times more for gas than in the US.
This paralysis adverse price terms, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
No freezing of salaries in the world will not stop an overwhelming victory cheap shale gas from the United States over European petrochemical industry.
As a result, the brewing revolt, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and to put Paris on one level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a tool to gain political legitimacy, and have already imposed their own economic policies in Europe, leaving destroyed the French economy in a mess.
The result-right, anti-EU party Marine Le Pen of the National Front just won a decisive election, the new yardstick for the ruling Party of Socialists into third place.
"The Front" is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote-a timely warning to British Labour that cannot proceed from the assumption that the split among the right-wing will automatically impact in favor of the left.
What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among French white working class?
She wants to use the elections to the EU next year, to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If-and it is very likely that anti-EU party will receive support in this election, this block will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European Parliament.
Here's my opinion: Soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again be something vague " Europe (sovereign) of nations," which enjoyed General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of her dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency.
I assume that the UK distances himself from the project, hoping to move closer to the US.
Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific indicates the likelihood that the UK will be left without attention in the cold Atlantic.
In what position it leaves Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (essentially) Little England.
Or we can protect their own economic interests, what it means, among other things, to send the Berlin and Brussels to hell in a handbasket.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in the broader European agreements on condition that we will keep its currency.
Cooperation with other countries-like-minded people will be easier in nonfederal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence.
The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is-ironically-the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity, which received a majority of votes in 2011 due to the objections of spending cuts proposed by (Labour) and implemented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and later by the coalition with the Tories and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would be ludicrous now to vote for independence, only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.

According to reports in Australia, at this time she spends his vacation in the resort zone Krabi in southern Thailand.
In Thailand, legal sources said that Mr Bamford currently represents a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal may lead to the fact that the court would increase the sentence for up to two years and will force her to serve time in prison for adults.
But after the recent killing of an Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket Thailand may also seek to rebuild his shattered tourist image that will lead to the acquittal of the guilty verdict.

Early puberty: Aging earlier
African American and Hispanic girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white, research shows.
The physical changes do not mean that puberty close
There is no evidence that blame hormones or other chemicals
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the mechanisms of early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge-a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Whether the mother to be startled if her daughter start to form the beginnings of mammary gland and lobby hair grow at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the children's endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time, calming parents-usually it doesn't mean a rapid onset of puberty," said Koplowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, lobby arm and underarm hair and the smell of the body, appear before girls.
But it was only a small shift in age menarche (the first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12,75 in 1970.
"After the chest begins to develop, is at least two to three years before the menarche," said Kaplowitz, who is also author of "early puberty in girls: How to cope with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test how puberty will deepen.
The debate about what constitutes actual puberty, but is considered premature, and when a breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp rise in growth of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or suspended-that's what the pediatrician can monitor carefully.
More rapid progression can serve as the basis for analyses the endocrinologist to prevent serious problems, such as tumors or cyst.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: Premature aging bones, which ultimately could lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy based on the child's age, level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
The Kaplowitz cautious with drugs, but admits that "the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers."
Another big problem is clear: Parents simply don't want them very young daughters were pregnant.
"They worry about the risks of pregnancy, or even about how they will cope with the issues of hygiene," said Koplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman, daughter of menstruation started in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
When she came home from school fearful and upset that it first among their friends.
There are many theories about the causes of early puberty.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that blame hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual promises in the media.
Boys-and girls-puberty begins earlier.
The Kaplowitz argues that the premise, which has the largest weight is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white age.
There are various explanations for.
Around the world on early puberty, apparently, affects everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys hair on the face and on the pubis appear at younger ages, a trend towards full early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as the girls.
Other physicians participating in the conference AAP, confirmed the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of pimples and pubic hair found even in infants and children of nursery age.
"We need to be careful about how we define the true puberty, " said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk with your child.
"It may mean an earlier than expected, the conversation," explained the Kaplowitz.
If you keep calm, your child is, as a rule, will react well.
The girls who bloom early, need proof that even when it happens early, this process is a normal part of life.

The Royal Bank of Scotland was suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division operations, according to two people familiar with the situation, that is another proof that the global audit regulators of alleged manipulation in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in their investigations related to the world's largest financial market, daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two trader will be the first by RBS, suspended during the unfolding investigation, which echoes with the scandal related to manipulating the Libor interbank rate.
Refusing to comment on the removal, the bank confirmed that this month he had received requests for information from regulators.
"Our ongoing investigation of this matter continues, and we fully cooperated with the FCA and our other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the knowledgeable person said that RBS handed over e-mail and instant messages that are received and sent his former trader, the UK regulatory body-the office controlling financial activities (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, resigned from RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, he provided a holiday on its current head of the European spot foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
The Rohan Ramchandani, head of European trading spot at Citi, has gone on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior FX trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders was not accused of any violations.
The group instant messaging contact Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable people.
The bank UBS said this week that he had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said he is investigating alleged manipulation in the currency market in some Swiss banks.
At least six of regulatory bodies in the world-the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's antitrust authority Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the currency board of Hong Kong-consider the argument that bankers were in cahoots to impact on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started an internal checks or have received requests for information from regulators, said a person familiar with the situation.
Banks through instant messages and e-mails for several years in search of cases of offences.
News of the checks up for traders in the area, in recent years, one of the largest sources of income trading divisions of investment banks, which this year, however, has faced difficulties because of low volatility of currencies reduces opportunities for dealers.
Some bankers tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation, saying that extensive and highly liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but older traders say that this is not always true.
In the words of a senior trader, despite the huge amount of daily trades in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and a wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that "you can start to affect the market for a very small price."
The news came on the same day that the bank Credit Suisse announced that it had sacked one of its traders of stock trading at the London Stock Exchange this week, after he caused losses of almost 6 million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue has managed to localize," said Credit Suisse.

John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the US spying "went that far."
John Kerry demonstrated easing tactics of protecting the programs tracking us, making an unprecedented acknowledgment that, in some cases, US spying had gone that far."
The secretary also recognized that guilty, along with Barack Obama, that has been "on autopilot" during the appearance of loud revelations by Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities.
These leaks have put the U.S. government in the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video on open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the Government actually took some of the things on autopilot, because such a possibility existed-and during the second world war, and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, September 11."
Then he became the first senior member of the United States government to recognize that the US spying had gone too far, but stressed that tie the rights have not been violated.
He said: " In some cases it has gone that far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain to the people, and now conducts a thorough review to ensure that no one was feeling of abuse.
I assure you, the abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted out of good intentions and that its operations tracking has saved many lives.
He added: " We are in a new world, where people are prepared to blow himself up.
In the world there is a radical extremism, reckless and determined to kill people, to blow up people and attacking the government.
And if you were in a position to intercept it, to stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented the collapse of planes, the bombings of buildings and killing people, because we were able to find out about these plans in advance."
Meanwhile, American lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US spying abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint anti-terrorism measures with the United States, " said the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday.
The senator from Connecticut's Chris Murphy said that he talked with members of the European Parliament and other officials this week and concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency.
"For US national security interests really important that Europeans remained by our supporters in relation to our joint anti-terrorist efforts," said Democrat Murphy, working in his first term and is chairman of the international relations of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
"And I'm going to Europe, to let them know that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs."
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding metadata that collected the NATO allies and which they shared with the US.
In other revelations were made public by the Snowden documents that the NSA was monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as phones approximately 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying activities on its allies as necessary and said that it is usual on both sides.
Against the backdrop of this hype Murphy said his office organizes the trip to members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.
Although Murphy has said that the goal of the trip is to improve relations, he said that a certain degree of the rigidity of the best of intentions " will also be shown.
He said that European leaders must be honest with my people in what spy programs they used for many years.
"While we can change our programs tracking to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also must agree with the fact that we're not the only one who engaged in intelligence activities," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should be this weekend to the Middle East and in Poland for the solution of problems of hostility towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as intelligence activities of the United States.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
"When I was little, Halloween was magical.
Us with her sister was allowed to eat candy, not late to bed and to hold a masquerade for our area.
Now I am more PoGoLite on traditions.
I was not caused in the last two years to hand out candy in his apartment and, most likely, will not and this year.
However, statistics show that I am white crow in terms of Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Retail trade, most Americans-namely 158 million-will be to celebrate Halloween this year, and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting every Halloween, is the trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the suits will take $1.2 billion from spent $6.9 billion.
This year, at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer need to be an affect sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or Markova.
As for men, I think we will see a lot of zombie with "The Walking Dead," and I am sure that the astronauts in the style of the band Daft Punk will get in our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the suits, which are most often, is zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps, there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dress our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only one.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend this year, $330 million on costumes for pets.
This means many funny dogs-dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we not malachite.
Americans will spend on them $1.9 billion this year, according to the Nielsen Company.
This is about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate bars, Lebenzon, Candies Milk Duds, chewing sweets Twizzlers and bars Clark bar.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is excellent news for 41 million of sweets that children who got ready to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and-let's not deceive ourselves-eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to eat, is candy in the form of the corn kernels; and yet, according to the National Confectioners Association, nearly 35 million pounds sold under their Halloween.
This is about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It is a mystery, which I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween, at home with ghosts.
They have terrific names, such as "terror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in this prison), " howling and screaming "and" The House of Shock."
Moreover, according to the Society of America Haunts, " in America, there are 1,200 officially recognized houses with ghosts, generating about $500 million of income, as well as those stunning photos, where you almost have described that your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't hide, and then the guy that you like, sees this picture and leave a comment like " a facial expression."
And in conclusion, will talk about the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, when we were children, and the cutting of the lamp Jack-it's like decorating a Christmas tree, what we're doing with childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion on a child in the pumpkin began only in the past year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up, clipping these pumpkin, not sitting in them.
According to the Census Bureau, the US population, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on the pumpkin.
The lamp Jack, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from the state of Illinois, which raised this year, 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you want the job tricky, visit Tim and Susan Macedon in the city of Napa, California and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weighing in 2032.

The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died on the " ridiculous randomness," believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside the collapsed sports gym mat at his high school, believe that their son was killed, said a lawyer for the family on Thursday.
The Kendrick Johnson from the town of Valdosta of Georgia was found on January 11 in the upright mat, fountain rests back to tribunal gym in his high school.
Investigators management of the county sheriff Lowndes concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of 17-year-old boy, disputes this.
"They are absolutely sure that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed that he died, as the sheriff.
"They believe that this is contrary to logic, the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.
They think that it is a cover for the protection of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent his son to school with school bag, and it returned them in the bag for corpses," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into the death of Johnson, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
That was the cause of death?
Whether his death was the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will review all the facts, wherever they led.
My goal is to learn the truth.
"I take the view that there are sufficient grounds for an official investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy found that Johnson died as a result "of positional asphyxia."
But a second autopsy, according to Moore, showed a different cause of death.
"There are several issues that should be allowed or to clarify," he said.
Moore added that if he will find enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he asked the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Office of the county sheriff Lowndes was not available for comment when approached on Thursday.
Judge South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to publish all videotapes of surveillance cameras, which were reviewed investigators.
Parents of teens said that they hope that the recordings contain the clue to how he died.

Owners have pawnshops in Singapore is doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In Lombard in shopping centre Bendemeer in Singapore the Janani Amirthalingam lays the golden bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for school teaching his daughter.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested there," said Ms. Amirthalingam.
Although she and earn S $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of south-east Asia-where the amount of indebtedness of households is growing-is such that ValueMax, where she spends her deal, this week became the third Lombard, listed on the stock exchange of Singapore.
Credit under pledge of jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalingam), but almost as cheaply unsecured bank loans.
Usually the pawnshops in Singapore 3.99 effective annual interest rates at 17% - slightly above 15.4% offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require the credit check or evidence of a salary and can lend faster than banks.
So millions of people across the region are turning to the pawnshops as households feel the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap loans, palpitates loose monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low-and middle-income people in the pawnshops, to compensate for the reduced incomes as the slowing growth of their economies.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, said the increase in family of leverage, primarily due to growth in mortgage lending, as a risk factor for creditworthiness Asian banks.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely emerged from technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed the continuing decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with the rising price of people in the middle and the bottom [of the scale of revenues] will be looking for ways to supplement their income, where only able, " says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, the Malaysian bank.
Record-high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the haste with which people lay all their belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family.
In Singapore, about 70% of the things are 200 Lombard points of the city-state, are gold.
People say: "The price of gold looks good, let's Baladyat gold chain grandmothers and get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnshops EasyMoney saw a rise in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in the Lombard business is such that ValueMax, operator offices in Bandimere and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where he has four of the shop, but also outside of Asia, too, says Yeah Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, with 60 percent of S $66 million, attracted this week as a result of placement of shares on the stock exchange of Singapore.
While some lenders have caused fire critics because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeoh says that Lombard does not only offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase the debt directly.
"Customers lay items that they already own, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households," she says.
The monitoringg is gaining wider public recognition as a means to obtain short-term secured funding.
And while the pawnshops are not only those categories of people who are in dire financial straits.
Rich people in Singapore also use branch of ValueMax, laying gold ingots or Rolex watch, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short term for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses, which need to overcome temporary financial difficulties," said Ms. yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.

The Russian security forces know nothing about the group "fraternal circle" Novye Izvestia
About interfax.ru writes, citing an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation.
"After a media report that the amendments to the U.S. Treasury Olatz Arruti the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate' brotherly Circle', we looked at all of the databases, but such groups not found," said the interlocutor of agency.
In his opinion, the spread of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As I wrote earlier, yesterday, the US Treasury has published on its website a list of alleged members of a criminal gang "fraternal circle."
Among them was named and the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
It appears in the list as " Grisha, posted the day before.
With the popular Russian singer they coincide.
The exact name is Grigory Leselidze, creative name, place and date of birth.
In addition, there mentioned another five people.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former Soviet Union, whose nationality is not specified.
In the United States are confident that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket transported for gangsters money according to their order.
To this message attached to the photo of the singer and all his data, which correspond to reality.
Moreover, the lips really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The agency said that they intend to impose sanctions against Olatz Arruti.
The man in black lists of American finance entails blocking his assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with individuals living in the United States.
The assistant Olatz Arruti Maya Sarikova said that no notifications to the singer had not admitted: "It is difficult to answer the question, whether it is Gregory, about which everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All that knows the LEPs is the information media.
Officially to him personally, there was no notification, even though I don't know whether they are in such cases.
"And, of course, all this is, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, is surprising and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, in Phuket Grigory Leps no lives, but according to the U.S. Treasury, the house on the Thai island, he really is.
She said that now the LEPs is in a long tour to the Far East and Siberia, and that news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.

A black box in your car?
While the American designers roads trying to find money to repair crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, neatly prescreened on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, tracking a motorist progeny every mile and transmit that information to officials, are at the center of contentious attempt to upgrade the system of financing America's highways, planning authorities in Washington and the state.
Usually boring arena planning highways suddenly has generated intense debate and alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to provide the right use of small boxes to track the number of miles you progeny and even, perhaps, where you go-and then use this information when drawing up tax bills.
Of the Tea Party movement in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union also deeply troubled and raises a number of questions about private life.
And although Congress cannot agree, to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They ponder how over the next decade, you can move to a system in which drivers pay for each mile road, which they pass.
Thousands of motorists had already taken on testing these black boxes, some of which have a function of satellite tracking.
It is really necessary for our country.
"This is not an issue on which we can have the right to choose," said Hasan Arat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which trains plans to start tracking the state authorities miles, progeny every California motorist, by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technology for this already.
The need for this is aggravated by a lack of funds the government fund the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay at the stations.
Americans already do not buy so much gasoline as before.
The cars drive more miles on one gallon.
The federal tax of 18.4 cents a gallon, had not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax by even one penny at high petrol prices.
"A tax on gasoline is simply impossible to maintain," said Li Minnich, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, was recently installed on the cars 500 tracking devices for testing system family of payment.
"This would be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
The beggar call it family user fee.
Not surprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, as with tax revenue will be able to change the nature of travel for reducing road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The authorities in California are eyeing up this system during the development of strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state for combating global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the transportation committee of the House, said he also sees this system as the most viable long-term alternatives.
Supporters of the free market in Reason Foundation also delighted from what will force drivers to pay for each mile.
"This is not just a tax, which will go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of Political Affairs reason.
The people directly pay for what they get.
This movement also is supported by two former ministers of transport in the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of family of payment.
The US Senate approved last year, a pilot project costing 90 million dollars, which would have involved about 10,000 cars.
However, leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who in everyday life, often many miles to get to work or to the city.
A few states and cities, however, are on the way.
The greatest enthusiasm evident in Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country a 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon be paying staff for miles run instead of the tax on gasoline.
In Nevada a pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, he is.
Illinois probate it on a limited basis with participation of trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes transportation departments 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studying how they will be able to conduct these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the government can monitor every move they make.
"Concerns about the" Big Brother "and similar things is a big problem," said Allauddin Khan, head of the strategy and performance management in the Department of Transportation of the state of Nevada.
It was not what I wanted people.
When the tests were underway, a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its Web site: "Very easy to convert these devices into a full-blown tracking devices."
There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be extended for the storage of records about day-to-day movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where are the difficult search for low-cost technology that would have allowed the state to record progeny car miles, but no information about the place and time.
If you will be able to do it, " said Khan, the society will feel more relaxed.
The search for this technology has led some agencies of the state to a small, young company in California called true mileage.
Initially the company was not engaged in assistance in tax collection.
She sought to enter the booming market type of insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage.
But the device that they test, attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically loaded with modem.
"People will be more inclined to do it, if you don't track their speed and do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of the true mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot programs.
There is much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, the designers are experimenting with giving drivers of different options.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they can just to abandon devices, opting instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles, passing all the residents of the state.
In other places we hope to sell the idea of the public, forcing the device to do more, not less.
In New York City transportation officials are seeking to develop Kalgoorlie device, which will also receive a payment over the parking meters, to provide "pay as travel" insurance pool and to collect data about the speeds in real time from other drivers, motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be to involve the benefits that they offer," according to the document urban design.
Some designers transport systems, however, think about not whether all talk about family payment just huge distracting factor.
In urban transport commission in the Bay Area of San Francisco officials say that Congress would be very easy to overcome bankruptcy trust fund for the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional lump sum or annual tax it would be possible to charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery, when all you have to do is to take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on legislation and public relations.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will have to worry about his private life and many other things.

In the past, the pope was decided on their own.
"Now that Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it was "quite possible" that Francis will turn to the Cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before-all this for us, for the first time.
Valero said that the pope was usually elevated in the post of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis " full of surprises-so we don't know who he will call ."

Investment in the factory amounted to more than 120 million rubles-Lei, - said Denis Grubanov.
In October launched a new mill, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produced as fine profile pipes, which is used for TEP-personal, small forms of construction and furniture industry and large-for the construction industry.
We plan to achieve the level of production of 50 thousands tons of production per year, which would be about 10 percent of its consumption in Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another activity, the number of employees at the plant have not decreased-it now stands at 157 people, plans while buying new equipment-an increase of more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining, and the required specialists chosen from existing.
Next year it is planned to introduce the new unit slitting steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will help to reduce the cost of products, as well as another mill, with the speed of production of pipes to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company are going to master production of pipes, which are used in the housing-communal services sector.
The administration's task to close up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tyumen region in this production.
Deputy director of the Department for the investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing heads of production, was advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
It is directed and forms of state support to the industry, which include the interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and expenses on his lease.
In the current year on these goals are to devote 150 million rubles, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The latest commission, which will review the subsidy agreement, taking documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimbursed the cost of local manufacturers in international fairs.
Next year's budget provided $150 million rubles, which can be used to offset leasing payments and credits for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to participate in trade fairs, 3 million on programs of energy saving.
Drop to 72 million rubles on the compensation ordered and paid for the equipment, which is produced in the south of Tyumen region for oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, this form of support will continue, as the motive for its introduction was the payment of tax on minerals extraction, which oil companies paid to the oblast budget.
At the moment, they do not and subsidies become direct spending commitments in the region.
With this in mind, the government's immediate priority believes support of industrial enterprises, not funding through the oil industry.
The aid budget will be associated with investment projects that will be implemented in the production.
Many business leaders had expressed concern in connection with the emerging situation in relations with oil companies.
The subsidies on their purchased equipment is a competitive advantage in the south of Tyumen region, and its abolition will be difficult to compete on price with an average strip of Russia, where cheaper labor.
In addition, unclear the question with a succession of new owner TNK-BP-company "Rosneft," which while not place their orders for Tyumen enterprises.
The agreement on implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and applications for its extension have not reported.
At the moment the South region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, can't form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
There remains an open question whether taxes are extracted from the Uvat District of oil in the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner.

The message: The Obama campaign headquarters considered the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times that top advisers President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton in the election list of 2012.
This discovery is the most spectacular stunt of all books mark Galperin and John Heilemann about campaign 2012 "rates doubled: The game has changed in 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming books and reported on Thursday night that the next president's assistants had conducted " large-scale research in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011, " to assess whether the exclusion of Biden to help raise a hope for Obama's re-election.
According to political commentator of The Times's Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by senior officials of the campaign and the White House, namely, the former head of the administration in the White House Bill daily, to assess, what effect will have a vote on the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton vice president.
Possible replacement was a mystery, carefully protected in the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers-including daily, former head of the Obama campaign's Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David's and David Plouffe-knew that the replacement is considered.
The book " rates doubled " says that the Daily was the initiator attempts to replace Biden, despite their " close personal relationship," but ultimately rejected that step, when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral roll will not improve significantly the chances Obama."
In an interview with Martin daily confirmed that the administration really considered the possibility of replacing Biden to Clinton.
"I was actively advocated the consideration of many things, and this was one of them," said Daily newspaper.
You must remember that at that point the president was in awful shape, so we thought: "Oh my God, what do we do?."
Although the daily has described the study as " necessary checks, " Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper to representative that the pre-election headquarters has a lot invested in the study that will do this step the dividends on the vote.
"Campaign headquarters not spend these sums of money on surveys and focus groups, if they don't consider something seriously," said Martin in AK 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked daily, knew whether his then boss about the possible.
Although daily and said that he doesn't think that the president was " in the know " possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that perhaps Obama knew.
Martin added that "rates doubled" does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results were political sensing to the table Obama.
Cooper asked Martin, seriously whether he believes that Obama did not know about the Research to rule out Biden from the electoral list.
Perhaps, " replied Martin.

The legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer

According to their pricey, consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Although businessmen initially counted on growth.
For the current year is for them badly: Sales fell 7 percent.
All told, the head of one of the largest brewery companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at III Annual Conference of the Institute of Adam Smith's " Commodities daily demand in Russia, " which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already fallen by 18 per cent, because in recent years the country has a significant strengthening regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and sales of beer-drink with a low alcohol content, " told the audience the ships.
In no country is such a severe restrictions of the beer market, unpredictable introduction of more and more new illogical prohibitions that motivated alleged struggle with alcohol abuse.
The brewer has complained that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse, does not have special influence, yet constantly and there are new initiatives.

For the next year, the two forecast.
Optimistic-the one that spoke the ships: Sales of this foamy drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic-will fall by another 2-3 per cent.
In order to maintain their profit, businessmen forced to leave varieties, designed for mass-market consumer, the "premium" beers will be less, but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, radical consequences from falling sales with a small amount of alcohol is not in sight.

What will the construction of the TPU in Moscow
Each year, city authorities promise to develop more transport and transfer nodes (TPU).
Until 2020, it is planned to enter the 255 TPU.
What actually turns the project, understanding our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, the Metro station Arbat Smolensk-Pokrovskaya line came the construction fence.
The caption read, that the arrangement's funding.
It was all very strange, because from Smolensk no terrestrial transport does not stop and, therefore, to change for him.
To get to the nearest trolley bus stops on the Garden Ring, we have to overcome about 130 meters, including ground moving through the Carminucci Lane.
Now the Smolensk almost all over.
Faded flower stall, dismantled a booth for newspapers, and the asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced by paving.
And the whole transport hub.
Transport-transfer sites are planar and capital, " explains in the press service of the Moscow Department of Transport.
No capital TPU.
And planar suggest the construction of car parks, shopping facilities, hindering the movement of passengers, creating small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, Planar TPU not even engaged in the transportation, and professional blogostroika from Department of the major overhaul of the city of Moscow.
Transport is not necessarily a complicated design, " explains director of the Institute of Economics and transport policies of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes enough of the roof over his head and scoreboard ringing time of arrival of transport.
Here, for example, the Metro Moscow has recently opened fully fledged planar transfer site.
Even without awnings, but ride car parks and the scoreboard showing when the next bus.
But in pursuit of a number of officials write the whole thing.
Back in 2011, the city was planning to build all the 151 node, of whom 59 capital construction.
Now in plans up to 2020 are up to 255 TPU.
Of them 150 promise to pass more this year.
Although the town has the program of development of TPU, not any qualitative criteria, " stated Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization " the city and transport."
Report on the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: First-time transplantation, secondly-convenience.
First of all, the ability to change the type of transport, not going out into the rain.
In Moscow when the development of TPU sometimes goes the other way around.
Example "VDNH" Metro."
Earlier commuter buses with Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance MMS.
Now they stop suffered on the opposite side of the street Yaroslava astronauts.
Farther from the subway, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential home.
A gift that residents didn't want bus station and complained in every possible instance.
With capital TPU in Moscow is somehow not immediately asked.
The first of them began to build five years ago, the hotel Planernoe.
The project is called was to be a model.
And really it was an example of how the transfer site, given to investors, turns into a banal shopping centre.
No, here there are the tourists for buses, the Canopy not to come from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking.
True, the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and 203 in the Moscow TPU places have not fundamentally.
As others pushed away from the Metro.
But under the trade more left.
One of only 32 of the clothing store, and generally there are almost everything-from the stone to the dealership.
Well, in fact, suddenly of the bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road?
We have, when build capital TPU, somehow always turns out shopping centre.
Recently the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot has decided to give to the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU Planernoe among marked on the floor of parking spaces is brisk trade.
The vegetables, spices, jeans, non-speech and the guards, viciously Palaguachi on our photographer.
Transfer the site finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that before the Metro Planernoe. It was the market, but it demolished.
And in the prefecture traders took pity and allowed to intercept parking funding.
Still, because of high prices there are always empty.
The same ridiculous that the market demolished in order to build in its place... a new painting TPU.
This is the castle.
The Metro Kaluga distance approach from the lobby of the Metro bus was 50 meters, " said Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a shopping center, ostensibly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To sit in the bus, you need to go through the whole shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to work around it under the open sky.
However, construction on Planernoe and Kaluga region will soon appear in the neck.
In mid-September, the City Planning Commission and City Council approved planning decisions for the first eight Capital TPU.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground level.
The monster will grow from the underground "Ring," it will be 418,7 thousand square metres of space.
Representatives of Railway Stations Directorate RZD, responsible for the construction of the TPU from Metro, already told journalists: In future rise will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
While officials say that a lot of parking places will take from one third to one half of the square.
Take for example, the people's garages.
For example, the garage on 258 cars, which has recently built on the international street, is 8015 square meters.
So, for parking 2.6 thousand cars "- Razumovskaya" will need on the order of 80,000 "squares.."
This is less than a third of the machine that there are going to build.
Let one or two floors will go on all the tourists for buses.
Remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
This is, wait a minute, almost two of gum.
If capital TPU at stations and railway stations are building the railway, the rest of the field will be able to master the Metropolitanos.
They also promised that there will be a lot of "functional objects," including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, in the department of property of the city of Moscow recently told reporters that the draft resolution, under which investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Because, they say, that the transport issues for the city-a priority.
Ideal TPU is, for example, the "Harvard" in Boston, or "Spadina" in Toronto, " says Alexander Morozov.
The trolley buses and trams down under the earth on the subway and the distance of the approach from the subway to the tram is only 50 metres without going out on the street.
Around no trade.
But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.
Or nothing we will build, or I'll throat 25 storeys with offices and apartments.

Bombardier profit declines with falling supply and the number of orders for planes
The corporation Bombardier, a Canadian maker of aeroplanes and trains, was announced on Thursday about a reduction in net profit by 15 percent and reduced the number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.
Located in Montreal company Bombardier also has not published any data for flight testing of its new CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information about whether the ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation to the next September.
After the first flight of prototype aircraft, about one and a half months ago, he was flying only three times, that raises questions about whether stage of tests on schedule.
The results had not fallen short of forecasts and led to the shares falling more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron's Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its estimate of "above average " to average because of the belief that the shares of restricted growth in the next quarter or two.
"Although the decline in the number of supply aircraft was largely predictable, we, of course, disappointed by the revenue of the transport department," said Doerksen in stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders as the continuation of the flight test program.
Nevertheless, if in the coming months will not be announced about new orders, we expect that the market will become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype aircraft was presented in March and for the first time flown in September after several months of delay.
But firm CSeries orders so far, not too much-177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of tests to verify the claims of the company on fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner.
Only now there are 403 of order and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief executive officer, Pierre was confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time when the first plane will be put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and media that the program is progressing according to plan.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Boduan during a conference call, adding that the downtime of the aircraft were scheduled ground tests and software updates.
All the manufacturers are planning test in different ways.
We decided to carry out the first flight and to have a break for updates, so we did.
So will occur throughout the flight test program.
The second of five test samples should make a flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow, as reported by the company.
Still, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first customers will be able to start exploitation of the CSeries aircraft after 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said that it evaluates the term of commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight tests-though, apparently, and consistent with domestic schedule Bombardier-underpins our view that the commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, "."said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, ended September 30, net income Bombardier declined to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same-9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest producer of aircraft reported that he had put 45 aircraft for the quarter, which for the previous year-57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders in the aerospace unit was $32.9 billion as of September 30, December 31.
"In the aerospace field results were consistent with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become unpleasant factor," he said.
Gross profit at the aerospace division fell 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest maker of trains, reported that gross revenue in this sector grew by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
Order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, slightly higher rate from December 31.
On of the transport department has negatively impacted the problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Officials said that in the fourth quarter will be presented a new development plan.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that chief financial officer of Google's Patrick Pichette will join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to $4,83 on auction in mid-Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker Bombardier and the nearest competitor, reported on Thursday a quarterly profit decline of 10 percent.

When she starts to rebel, she is experiencing extreme cruelty at the hands of the sudiste-abbess of the and becomes an object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never falls to intolerance or sensational-and that's the problem.
Because of their serious solemnity of the narrative risks becoming a test like hair and for the audience.
