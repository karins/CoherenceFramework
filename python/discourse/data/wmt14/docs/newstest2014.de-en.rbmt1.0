Schools are stopped to larger focus on mathematics, orthography and grammar
In courses to English literature pupils must in the future at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel the 19. Century, treat romantic lyric poetry and contemporary British novels starting from 1914.
Into the examination also „unseen texts find to” entrance, in order to stimulate to broader reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
Starting from 2015 pupils their own GCSE examination for language placing must, whereby there are strong incentives for selecting English literature as separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will tomorrow publish the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects, which were radically transformed.
Other core subjects are changed next year.
In a separate initiative becomes Ofqual, which supervisory authority for examinations, a reorganisation of the GCSE structures to announce, including a new grading system and a less coursework.
In a speech in the summer said Secretary of Education Michael Gove that there are one „broad consent that we must reform our test system, around public trust to restore”, whereby he stressed, which would become GCSEs „more provocatively, more ambitious and stricter”.
Studies show that in English schools less time on mathematics one spends – 116 hours per year or three hour weekly per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast to this Australian schools inform on the average 143 hours annually and pupils in Singapore receive 138 hours.
It will not give a formal requirement to plan in the time table more time for mathematics but from coalition sources means it, which comprehensive math examination – combines with a stronger weighting of the subject in rank lists – will encourage schools probably to set more hours.
In the curriculum more attentions to „problems from the correct life” one puts, including mathematics of finance.

To the responsible persons
I was asked to write you concerning your investigation for mass monitoring.

In the course of my occupation in these facilities I became a witness of systematic violations of the law of my government, which caused me from moral obligation to acting.
As result of the publication of these doubts I saw my family and my homeland relying I to a serious and continuous agitation suspended, which forced me.
I live at present in the exile and enjoy limited asylum, which grants me the Russian federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged of the resonance on my political action, both in the USA and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high office-holders - including the United States - have the exposures to a system of the overarching monitoring, which is not guilty to anybody of account, when judges a service at the public.
These espionage exposures drew many proposals to new laws and guidelines, which aimed at the before times covered abuse of public trust.
The benefit for the society from these won realizations becomes increasingly clearer; at the same time the risks taken in purchase were obviously decreased.
Although the result of my efforts was as can be prove positive, my government disagreement still treats as loyalty break and strives to criminalize political expression of opinion and place under accusation.
Nevertheless: The truth to express is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States with support of the international community becomes this detrimental attitude placing.
I hope that I, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are settled will be able, me at the responsible clearing-up of the facts concerning the statements, in particular regarding truth and authenticity of the reports transacted in the media, to take part appropriately and law-appropriate.
I look forward to a discussion with you in your country, as soon as the situation is clarified and thanks you for their efforts to protect the international law us all protected.

On the way by mud, rivers and jungles for free medical supply
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance into remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and its team almost spend each weekend to treat hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many physicians, only one for 5.000 humans
Co-ordinate here or with your Mobil equipment
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the Top 10 „the CNN Heroes OF 2013”.
They can for it or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 co-ordinate, in order to select it to „the CNN Hero OF the Year”.
The winner receives 250,000 dollar for the continuation of his unusual work.
Long Georges Bwelle viewed 21 years, how his patient father again and again lost consciousness and to hospitals traveled, which did not have the means, in order to help him.
Jamef Bwelle became 1981 with a car accident in close proximity to Yaoundé, which injures capital of Cameroon.
First it had only a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation, which expanded on its brain and caused there a hematoma, which should impair it for the rest of his life.
„It gave no to neurosurgeons in Cameroon”, thus Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought it out from Cameroon, if we had had the money.
Instead spent Bwelle years to accompany its father in overcrowded hospitals and hospitals to offer in order to get there the treatment, which they had.
„It is not simple”, commentates Bwelle.
One can at five o'clock in the morning the house leave and to the hospital run, in order to be first, and is nevertheless not first.
There are a great many patients.
Some humans die even, because they must wait.
The situation hardly changed, since Bwelles father died 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one physician for 5,000 humans each, so the World Health Organization.
In contrast to this the relationship lies in the United States with a physician for 413 people.
But even if there were a physician for it, most Kameruner could not afford the visit.
Two of five humans in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarter of the expenditures for health in the country are private.
„The only problem, which they have, is the poverty”, says Bwelle.
And the poverty not possibly makes it to enjoy the life.
Its father and so many of its compatriots suffering to see let mature in Bwelle the resolution to undertake somewhat against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and its volunteer team accomplished 700 free operations in the last year.
He became even a physician and works as a container surgeon in the cent ral hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition it created a nonprofit organization named ASCOVIME, which travels to weekends to rural areas and offers there free medical supply.
Since 2008 it and its volunteer group helped scarcely 32,000 humans.
Almost each Friday obligations it and up to 30 people into minibuses and drive themselves with the tied medical equipment on the roof over fastened terrain into the villages, the assistance need.
Always everything does not run smoothly.
Already more than once they had to push the vehicles by rivers and mud.
But if they arrive, they are received like heroes: a feast, a singing and dance and the best accommodation, which the place has to offer.
In these villages free medical supply is real a reason to celebrating and Bwelle – with its broad smile and its boundless energy – participates gladly with the merry celebration.
On the next morning the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
„Pro trip we treat 500 people”, thus Bwelle.
They come from an area of 60 kilometers around the village – and to foot.
Each of these weekend hospitals offers medical supply in a set of ranges.
Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexual transferable diseases.
Others receive sprags, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document, which is necessary for the school, however many poor families simply not to afford know.
In the evening the team implements simple operations with local anaesthetization.
The operations normally take place in a school, the city hall or a apartment; after the interference the patients rise and go into the recovery range, around place making for the next one.
The lighting for the OI and the disinfection equipment fed of the generator of the group and in such a way to work Bwelle and its volunteers into the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a arduous workload, but the village musicians normally help to keep the team motivated.
„You drum the whole night, with it we to remain awake and our work to continue be able”, say Bwelle.
On Sunday the team drives then back into the city, tiredly, but proudly on the performed work.
The group – a mixture from Cameroonian physicians and foreign medical students – accomplished and knows 700 free operations in the last year that it causes an enormous difference for humans, who she helps with her work.
A man explained that the free operation of a ledge break, which it received makes possible for him now to work again.
„The future of my family changes”, meant the man.
Beside the weekend hospitals and its work as a surgeon in the hospital Bwelle works also at night in private hospitals in Yaoundé.
With this second job of financiers it 60% of its non-profit activity, so Bwelle; the rest originates from private donations.
„I do not know really, when he sleeps, says” Katie O'Malley, which studies in the second year to the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group cooperates.
It always either in the hospital or tried is to raise money for the organization so that it can go on these campaigns.
For medicine and nursing for the sick students such as O'Malley, which come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experiences which were never gotten it at home.
„We can be with operations thereby, where we help, blood to dab or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle hold”, explain O'Malley.
That would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.
The students normally pay their travel to Cameroon and bring along frequently donated medical material.
If they are however for a start in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and the instruction.
„He is completely certainly a hero”, says O'Malley.
He does not dedicate his life to this organization and its desire to help the Cameroonian people knows borders.
For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a load.
Other to a happier life to help and thus a promise fulfill, which it gave to its father, prepares large joy for it.
„I am so happy, if I make, mean this work” for Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope, he see, what I do.
I make it, in order to bring humans back the laughter and alleviate around the pain.

Pope Franziskus appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Franziskus will appoint new cardinals of the catholic church for the first time on 22 February, as Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the catholic church after the Pope and them are it also, which select a Pope, so that Franziskus thereby will appoint the first group of men, who will finally participate in the choice of its successor.
At present there are 201 cardinals.
However a cardinal, who reached an age of 80 years, can do no more at the Papal election participates – is assigned to a group of 120 „cardinals entitled to vote”.
In an explanation, in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of Vatican said, it a meeting of all cardinals will take place, before the ceremony is held for the appointment of the new cardinals, which admits also as consistory is.
„Pope Franziskus decided, his decision for the summoning of the consistory in February in advance admits to be given, thus different meetings, which require the participation of cardinals from all over the world, be planned can”, said Lombardi.
Jack Valero von Catholic Voices said that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote will have probably sunk until February.
He explained, a Pope normally appoints so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote amounted to again 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.
The consistory in the next year is important, because it is first since the choice of Franziskus in March this year, like that Valero.
At present give it a certain overhang to up sides of Europe and in particular Italy.
„It will see being interesting, whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world, around the balance to restore”, said it.
Forty percent of the catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will be also first, who will appoint since the education of the advice of the cardinals created by Franziskus, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, who have the order to find possibilities for the reformation of the church.
In the past the Pope decided everything alone.
„Now Franziskus selected these eight cardinals, who are to help him”, said Valero.
He explained, it was well possible „” that Franziskus asks the cardinals for advice.
But so far we were not in this situation – that is completely new everything.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would appoint as cardinals, but does not put Franziskus „full surprises – we know thus not, whom he appoints”.

Of Europe ready is elite to make with Great Britain business?
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention of bringing and of defining the economy to a table, what those, which provide in Great Britain for prosperity and work, would like to change in our relations with the European Union.
For this purpose we gave the largest and most comprehensive survey under British industrial leaders in order and asked them, what them over Great Britain, which think economy and the European Union.
YouGov asked over 1.000 executive personnel from the economy, who into for instance the British business sizes, - sectors and regions illustrate.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found out that the vast majority of the enterprises concentrates in the meantime outside of Europe exported and on countries, which modernize and grow, while the states in the European Union stagnate.
They desire that from government side new business connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored, to reform instead of be with the long and arduous process, the obscure European Union-institutions.
For their opinion to certain legally regulated topics – from the cartel law to the product legislation – the majority of the industrial leaders of the opinion, control of these key competencies is in demand should for Westminster be brought back.
It prevailed general discontent over the domestic market, since according to statement of the enterprises the costs of the Brussels regulations would outweigh in the meantime the advantages, to part from of Europe trade zone to be – even 40 percent of the large-scale enterprises agreed, which are traditionally Europeanfriendliest.
Finally, and our questioning probably says from industrial leaders at most, showed that a clear majority desires of Great Britain a course toward change of the agreement and a relationship with the European Union, which is based on trade not on politics.
This realization, which is at enterprises of all sizes and prominent companies, shows that the economy pushes meaningful change”, which brings the booklet of acting back to Great Britain on one „.
It concerns – a change of the agreement much and improves conditions for Great Britain with 16 percent to a shift of opinion in favor of the whereabouts in the European Union in a popular vote would lead.
The prime minister should not have doubts: This survey shows that the British economy behind its plan for the renegotiations of the British conditions stands for the EU membership.
It shows also that the enterprises of a renegotiation expect a clear shift of the balance of power back to Great Britain.
Better deals for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, after the euro zone moves now toward a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority jobs and growth must be in Great Britain, as the result of our survey shows, what for enterprise an intensified attention to trade and a fundamental change in Brussels approach for regulations means.

Property oh: Still more security for pedestrians
They do not stand 100 meters from each other remotely: On Tuesday into property oh new B 33-Fußgängerampel at the village parking lot in enterprise one took - in range of vision of the older city hall traffic light.
Two plants so near together: Intention or Gothamite caper?
This question answered of property ACH yesterday mayors clearly.
“The city hall traffic light was installed at that time, because this secures the way to school”, for described Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
Yesterday officially the plant taken in enterprise is important for the crossing range Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa gardens, the bus stop, a physician and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the populated area› dug ‹.
“With high traffic and pedestrian arising a further traffic light had”, ago so Eckert for their security.
This confirms also Peter Arnold of the district administration office open castle.
“Sound current measurements on the B of 33 daily about 12,000 vehicles the community property oh, of it about ten percent heavy transport” is driven through, stresses Arnold.
Therefore the building of a further traffic light is more than necessary: “Security goes here simply forwards”, thus to Arnold.
Altogether four traffic exhibitions, also a roundabout were accomplished were started thinking, however because of the tightness within the crossing range Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold with the choice of location the traffic light masts before all this was tested: “Means we have extra for us with particularly long wood trunks of loaded transporters edition-Estonian-constantly, whether these vehicles from the Sulzbachweg can drive out on B 33, without the traffic light masts to snap”.
Those approximately 15,000 euros expensive traffic light device is the “most modern, which gives it on the market” at present, to described Arnold.
The plant is equipped with colored LEDs, which shine so strongly that the lights of the drivers are to be recognized for example also with low-standing sun well.
And economically is it also: The older lighting systems use about 100 Watts, the new just eight Watts.
Per driving direction there are three lighting systems.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar detectors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar detector the traffic conditions test.
If the road is free, directly green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
A further radar detector checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
“A group should or go-obstructed humans over the road to go, the green phase is extended, it comes thus everyone reliably over the lane”, explained Arnold.
Naturally the driver must follow here as partners and observe the lane.
This was not yesterday the case: The traffic light for pedestrians hardly showed green, rushed an upper class vehicle through - with bright red.

The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag sample over a length of scarcely six football fields, connects storage halls in close proximity to Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, the USA.

The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures, which were started thinking once by the former immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, which stayed yesterday to discussions over human being smuggling in Sri Lanka, converted five of the recommended changes, which become others still considered.
If „the authenticity criterion is taken over”, then someone, which requests a visa, could be examined to that effect, whether „the request is genuine in the cases, in those the applicant to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting enterprise related or personally connected is.”
In addition companies could be obligated to put account down over the number of 457-Visumsinhaber after in the past enterprises, which wanted to support first only a small number of workers, stopped final hundreds.

“The signals serve security and are legally prescribed”, say Matthias Schrell, Geschäftsführer of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
With unfavorably standing wind is that to hear unfortunately far away - and so there were already some complaints of people from the city north.

Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was small, Halloween had somewhat magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and to disguise us for the neighbourhood.
Today I became rather the Halloween Muffel.
In the last two years I did not explain myself ready to distribute from my apartment from sweets and it this year will probably not do.
But according to statistics I am a black sheep, which concerns Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million, in order to be exact – celebrate this year Halloween and spend thereby altogether 6.9 billion US Dollar on sweets, costumes and decorations, so the US-American federation of the retailers (NRF).
A thing, to which I look forward each Halloween then nevertheless again, are the trend values.
The costumes will constitute about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion spent US Dollar, so the NRF.
In this year are tantalizing dead articles the last word.
Women do not have to wrap themselves no more in sexy clothes, them can now also seductive meal as for instance pizza, a Hamburger or carrots embody.
Which concerns men, I expect a lot of zombies owing to The Walking DEAD, and I bet, which becomes Daft punk Weltraummänner it this year into the Instagram feeds to create.
According to Google the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, Piraten and Hexen.
I assume, it am wrong nothing at tradition.
We disguised last year our dogs and were thereby to my astonishment not alone.
Americans actually spend 330 million dollar this year on costumes of their domestic animals, so the NRF.
Those are a quantity „Hot Dogs”.
Which concerns sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend this year 1.9 billion dollar on it, so The Nielsen Company.
Those are about 270 million kilogram at chocolate bars, Lutschern, drops and gummi bear.
Thus good news for according to US-Ministry of Trade 41 the millions of people, who pulls sweet or sour with the saying „” by the quarters.
We will actually buy over 40 million kilogram of chocolate for Halloween and – will make we nothing pre to eat itself.
The only one, which we would not like to consume, is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; 15 million kilogram of it around Halloween are sold nevertheless, so the national federation of the confectionery manufacturers.
Those are about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery, which I could not solve yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses, in which it haunts.
They have great names like „terror Behind of the embankment” (which is by the way located in a genuine prison), „Howl O Scream” and „The House OF shock”.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spook houses in the United States, which obtain 500 million dollar proceeds, thus America striking NT, and the marvelous photos include, on which one pees oneself straight into the trousers and which friends place then on Facebook, where one does not get rid of her again, and then the type, on which one stands, leaves a comment to one like „nice facial expression”.
But we come finally to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the large pumpkin, when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like a decorating of the Christmas tree – something, which from small we made on.
Fortunately began „the babies in the pumpkin” - trend only last year owing to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up thereby, the pumpkin to into shape-carve and not to sit in it.
This year Americans about 106 million dollar on pumpkins will spend, so US the Census office.
The pumpkin lantern, which rots slowly in the front garden, probably originates from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilogram of pumpkins were harvested.
If you liked to score correctly, then you called Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve you somewhat pretty from its 921 Kilo heavy pumpkin.

It tended to break resistance with force and threats.
It retained the incomes of the women, who purchased partially for many years for him.
By confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards he prevented contacts of the women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague, who placed the women, it brought it into different brothels in the southwest.
There it let it supervise partially, in order to control their incomes.
In court the accused stated first, he suffers under a heavy trauma, after colleagues had died into Afghanistan beside him with an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert put down large doubts about the psychological restriction and thus at reduced criminal liabilities suggest, the 33-year old comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear of the damaged women more.
How a criminal investigation department official reported, at least four further cases could be determined by exploitative slave trade after a first announcement by telephone monitoring measures.
The heard discussions were coined by high aggression.
In later hearings the damages would have confirmed their martyrdom.
A further witness, with whom one of the women at the whole body had discovered blue marks, made to today no statement.
It concerns “a completely broken personality”, that views force and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The accused regretted his behavior yesterday.
“It separated from these circles and wants to lead a completely normal life after the detention”, meant it.

Tripodi denies, by Obeid to have been affected
Against the former Minister of the laboratory party Joe Tripodi from new South Wales a determination is introduced by the national supervision of corruption.
The former NSW Minister denies the regulations for maritime farm lease on request of its political mentor Eddie Obeid to have changed who possessed covered participation in three properties on state-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC independent commission against corruption) expanded its investigations on Friday to the question, whether Obeid affected different Ministers of State to that effect, leases at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids two restaurants and operated a café, without announcement after their running out in August 2005 to extend.
Now because of the accusation one determines, Tripodi from Obeids covered interest in properties knew, after Tripodis had stated former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole accordingly on Thursday.
In discussions for many years, which began 2005, the government had pushed on public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were and wanted besides longer running times.
2009 was extended the leases for the enterprises at the Circular Quay, which brought in the Obeids annually 2.5 million dollar, without public tender.
Tripodi, which was of February 2006 until November a 2009 port Minister, had originally expressed itself for public tenders.
But it denied the changes on requests of Obeid to have made that, as Tripodi confirmed, on a transformation of the lease regulations of the government had pushed.
One the ICAC submitted telephone minute showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading official, who was changed in the port Ministry, after he had worked under Obeid in the fishery authority.
„The topic discussed in these telephone calls was the elaboration of the commercial farm lease regulations? ”, the deputy committee member asked Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
„No”, Tripodi answered.
I cannot remember, what was discussed, but that was it definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.

NSA exposures strengthen firm paranoia because of national monitoring
On a mild day at the end of August flew a German law enforcement helicopter deeply over the US-consulate to Frankfurt/Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On instruction of the federal office for protection of the constitution and counterterrorism (BVT), the German interior secret service, he should photograph the roof of the US-outguard, who less than 5 km of the European central bank and the Federal Bank is.
According to German media the BVT wanted to prove the presence of monitoring antennas and the action led to a dispute between the USA and the German State Department in Berlin.
James Clapper, US-American Director OF national Intelligence, consisted to develop these again in September on it that the USA did not use possibilities of the foreign espionage to steal „around the trade secrets of foreign enterprises on behalf US-American companies thereby their international competitive ability or their profit could.”
But since Edward Snowden, who is not to the Whistleblower former employees become, with whom publication of its Füllhorn at US-American monitoring secrets began, European governments and head of a company any more surely whether they can take the director with the word.
Reports, according to which the American national Security Agency the Brazilian oil company Petrobas spied and data of American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo procured itself, brought firm paranoia because of national monitoring on a new highest level.
The barrel for overflowing possibly already brought the exposure that chancellor Angela Merkels telephone was verwanzt, for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can turn out in its sights, then also managements are potential targets with security.
Snowden made intensive co-operation between U.S. secret services and enterprise transparency.
I believe, it am conceivable that these data are used for the mutual benefit.
„Germany must wake up”, explains Oliver Grün, Präsident of the BITMi, which represents small and middle IT-companies in Germany.
German enterprises believe, the USA represented now almost just as large risk as China, if it concerns industrial espionage and data larceny, so a survey, which was published in July by the advisor company EY.
In the documents oozed by Snowden there was however so far no proof that the USA passed the trade secrets on of foreign enterprises to own companies.
Politicians expressed their concern over the fact that certain IT and Internet possibilities were missing to the European Union and their dependence on the USA it should reduce.
The enterprises are in this connection sceptical.
In the Bundestag was suggested, we should construct a German Google.
I can close only my eyes and open her slowly again…
„So functioned that”, does not say Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software vendor SAP.
If one had wanted a strong European IT industry, then one had been supposed to let her become extinct not before 20 years.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, by the coal over cars up to the agriculture.
Everything, up to the IT-industry.
Nevertheless range and technical refinement of the US-Spionagebehörden uncovered by the Snowden exposures shocked companies, which had before seen the largest espionage risk in China.
At the Cloud Computing takes place a large change, because European enterprise leaders are conscious now that in the USA stored data are subject to the local jurisdiction and therefore potential are endangered.
According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, accomplished survey rejected about ten percent not in the USA of the residents of members of plans after the exposures over the US-American DATA Mining activities with Prism to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: „We see a new question of customer, who gave it one year ago not yet – she reads: Where my data become and can stored you guarantee that these remain physical in this right area?”
Many German enterprise leaders hold the opinion, which confirms recent report simply only, what they anyway already knew, i.e. that powerful States of their most valuable secrets to steal want and these therefore at any price to be guarded to have.
That industrial espionage takes place, is no surprise.
That was always like that.
„It was many years long a topic and by the current discussion fundamentally changed”, does not say Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemistry company BASF.
The Americans spy us on commercial and industrial level, as we also make, because it is in the national interest to defend our enterprises.
The management does not boast normally over the counter measures, which one seized, because provides for aggressors advantages.
In large enterprises for a long time hammered into that carrying of a free USB stick forward on a fair or unguarded leaving of a laptop is not advisable in the hotel room, gentle is said to employees.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Vorstandsmitglied with automaker Audi, says that it belongs for years to standard practice to collect before an executive committee meeting the mobile phones so that her not when listening units can be used.
The German BVT guesses/advises executive personnel to use simple Prepaid mobile phones if they go on foreign travel, because smartphones can possibly be compromised.
The Prepaid mobile phones are afterwards thrown away.
There is however the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain open to attack in relation to Hacking and monitoring.
In Germany many of these enterprises are world-wide market leaders in the respective niche.
„Small and medium-sized enterprises are missing often the experience, staff and financial resources, around trade secrets effectively approximately did not authorize access to protect”, do not warn the BVT in a report.
The USA warn own companies before industrial espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post in US were arranged national the Intelligence Estimate in February France, Russia and Israel behind China on rank two of the countries, which availed themselves for the procurement of economic parameters of the Hackings.
A member of the board of a German Blue chip enterprise agreed, if it concerns industrial espionage, then „is the Frenchmen the worst ones”.
Bernard Squarcini, former director/conductor of the French interior secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: „Secret services know very much exactly that all countries, even if they co-operate in the fight against the terror spy their allied ones.”

But none was preparatory for three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The tot, who are not even in the kindergarten and made only before a few months its first steps, and his Shetland Pony Toffee trotted loosely by the three rounds and got the first price – whereby they let 30 adults opponents behind itself.
The inseparable pair, both equally large, because of its occurrence, behavior and style with the annual competition were praised, which is organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry close Cardiff.
With its appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons he had put and led his plate hat on in an impudent angle the two years old Toffee by the ring.
Fenton was praised by the Juroren for its natural abilities while handling the pony, which would lie far over its age.
And Toffee received full marks for its occurrence and its personality.
Fenton had gotten Toffee last March as gift to its third birthday and had practiced since then each day with the Shetland pony.
Its mother, Donna, 30, said: „Fenton and Toffee are a great bottom plate.”
They had to begin against the entire participant field and with gold cup and rosette from the place went.
It was only the second time that it had participated with Toffee in a competition, and we were enthusiastic all, when he won.
It held foreigner in the arena perfectly it for so phenomenally that they wanted to be photographed with it.
The small boy from the village Nantyglo in close proximity to Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footstep of his aunt Sharon Howells, who demonstrates horses for over ten years.
Howells told: „The whole audience was as electrified and everything it encouraged and applauded.”
It ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he carried fantastic work out.
Fenton is moved after animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, about which he worries.
As it is started, it will not for a long time last, until he on „the horses of the year” - exhibition actual and I am sure me that it will fare well.
A spokesman of the annual horse exhibition said: „Fenton is only three, but he white, as he with his pony to deal must.”
Together they are a great team.
The Juroren evaluated Fenton and Toffee thereafter how well they would have struck themselves and would have presented in the demonstrating ring.
They pay attention to good co-operation between pony and leader – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best ones in the ring.
I am me reliably that Fentons contributed sweet clothes their part to it, fit really perfectly the cause.

The tourist goal of farsightedness covers itself according to Tribukait with the goal, in the meantime the old common land feasting field with its specific protected habitat types, closed up strongly, too received by opening and connection to the still existing pastures.
Certain kinds as for instance rare butterflies and grass hops cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free connections to the species conservation.
Tribukait said, she did not want to miss it here to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
Into this planning do not only insert yourself the current measure smoothly.
A biosphere area offers also the opportunity to lasting more economically like ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition with the Life project as well as the past care days reached for the future.
According to these different versions district leaders Christoph Wehle and Life Projektmanagerin Cornelia Bischoff divided the aides in groups.
The larger trees had been struck before already, the forest tractor stand if necessary on call.
A group of aides should worry about the exemption of juniper shrubs and about the care of a drying stone bolt.
A goal was the free view at the lookout point.

Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollar for Tasmanian health service
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions, which are linked with the rescue package over 325 million Australian dollar for the Tasmanian health service, in order to guarantee that the government of the Federal State cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced, Commonwealth to that „immediate measures” will seize, in order to turn a crisis away, which was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher ratio at chronic illnesses and system restrictions.
The financing for one period of four years was decided after government consultation with the independent Tasmanian delegate Andrew Wilkie.
„The government tied an emergency rescue package, which turns on in our opinion the singular challenges, to which opposite the Federal State sees itself”, explained Plibersek today.
The 325-Millionen-Dollar-Paket covers 31 million dollar emergency aid for choice elections.
By further 2600 operations, including orthopedic interferences and treatments because of grey star, residuals are to be eliminated.
Beyond that there is money for day hospitals in kind of main header and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, the specialist training, services in the range mental health and the introduction of a system as the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
„These investments correspond to the ideas, of which hospital employees concerned told me, it are the best possibility, the Tasmanian health system to improve”, said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict report and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The Federal State must the current financing level maintained, in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly where the extra money was spent.
A three-person commission is furnished and is to guarantee that the Federal State makes health services available as effectively and efficiently as possible.
How Wilkie explained today, the 325 million dollar would only little use, if „they are not accompanied by genuine reforms, those the public Tasmanian health system on a lasting course bring.”
Regardless of its it praised the government for the fact that she had reacted to its request for urgent assistance, whom he expressed first opposite the prime minister at the beginning of May.
„I am that federal aid will make a large contribution in addition, the public health system of the Federal State from the concern list to take confidently”, said Wilkie.
According to the government of the Federal State these choice elections will make up for the recent cuts to a large extent.
But the health-political spokesman of the opposition on federal level, Peter Dutton, is the opinion, the today's announcement is only one „plaster solution”.
„We are in the today's situation, because the laboratory state government took off, said 430 million dollar from the health system” it opposite ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government tears almost a half billion dollar from the system and that puts in and then does Commonwealth 300 million in such a way, as if is good realigning.
Dutton demanded Plibersek on to guarantee that only one dollar of the rescue package is not spent on additional bureaucracy.

Well 40 women visited the last woman breakfast of this year in the protestant parish Bisingen.
Topic of the day in the community center were “proverbs from the Bible” and “idioms from the Middle Ages”.

One could call it the Dostojewski of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a Metaphysiker, its novels and narrations has also something serial.
Astonishing the relationship in the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And in such a way, as Fjodor M. Dostojewski with its substantial Oeuvre is to be understood as Ergründer and Apologet of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as American prophet, which is valid in the own country quite somewhat.
Some titles appeared to publishing house in the Heyne, the Haffmans cartridge with the 118 narrations sell two thousand-unity.
Thickly America explains - the realm of the technical progress breath-taking, paired with paranoia, safety illusion and the faith to be chosen.
Thickly had God experiences, his late books read themselves like a mixture from the relevation of the Johannes and a computer manual.
Perhaps it was moved, drugs to its brain had added.
He understood, early already that the computers are Divinitäten.
It wrote a theology of the computer and asked, what differentiates humans from a machine, the creator of its creature.
That is “Blade Runner” - problem.
Killing.
A master of the Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
Its stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This history is now particularly significant.
The “minority report” originates from the year 1956, it radiates the smell of the cold war and the McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of the “Prä crime” is developed here, “Pre Crime”, thus what in the meantime more or less official doctrines of the white house are.
In Dicks world, which resembles our terrifying, mutants look into the future - and the police accesses.
“We seize individuals, who offended, say against no law” the boss of the authority.
“We snatch it us, before they can commit a violent crime”.
And: “In our society there are no big criminals, but we have a prison camp of full Pesudoverbrecher”. They read time stream.
They accept that bad happens, and prevent that the criminal thought is put into practice.
Dicks narration works like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the hearing intoxication of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Thus also Obama's drone philosophy functions and - to practice.
But Dicks story is not yet in the end.
The police head deplores the fact that it gives no more division of power, which controls military the everyday life - and which from the state is remaining.
Then the supervisor is supervised and transferred of a future crime.
The system revs up.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own conditions.
Mistakes and victim takes not only in purchase, but develops themselves on it.
The system creates the danger, which fights it.
Philip K. Dick read is called, again and again, to come the truth more near.

Court blocks decision on the stop and Frisk guideline of the NYPD
A Federal Court of Appeal in the USA blocked the arrangement of a judge, who had demanded changes at the stop and Frisk program („and scan a stopping”) New Yorker police departments, on Thursday and relieved the judge of the case.
The 2nd US-court of appeal explained, the decisions of judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended, until on an appointment of the city was decided.
The judge had judged in August, the city offence against the condition with the way, as the program for stopping and questioning of people are converted.
The city inserted appointment against its estimate and the arranged remedies to furnish including the decision, one supervisory body which was to support the police with the change of its guideline and the appropriate training program.
The court of appeal heard the arguments on Tuesday for demanded suspension.
The appointment report explained, the judge had to be relieved by the case, since she injured the code of conduct for US-American judge, as it is certain that a judge is to avoid the appearance of the partyness; this was partly justified with a set of medium interviews and public statements, in which she had reacted publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged, police officers injured the civil rights of tens of thousands of humans, because they would take black and Latin American men with the stop and Frisk program in inadequate way aimed in its sights.
She appointed an external place the monitoring of the conversion of substantial changes, including reforms with guidelines, training and supervision of service, and arranged a pilot program also at the body carried cameras in quarters, in which most controls were accomplished.
In August the city explained itself New York ready to terminate the practice of the storage of names and addresses from people to who became to dismiss after control by the police again.
A verbal negotiation for the appointment of the city is after that 14. March 2014 planned.
Stop and Frisk tactics was criticized by a set of civil right advocates.
There are but rose controls of this kind for decades in different forms, the number of noted controls during the term of office of the non-party mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all time high of 684.330 in the year 2011, most of it black and Latin American men.
2004 were submitted by four men, who belonged all minorities, complaint, which developed to a class action suit.
Proponents of changes at the stop and Frisk program of the NYPD say, which becomes changes unfair practices to terminate and a more trustworthy and more effective police to create as well as the way affect, as other police headquarters use the regulation.
Opponents are the opinion, which changes would absorb the moral of the police, but not the crime; also money was wasted and the broader problem of a police was not solved, which is after omission thousands of places in the last decade at pressure.
The judge pointed out that she does not terminate the stop and Frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only the kind of the conversion of controls reforms by the NYPD.

Anger over judgement for bomb casual from Bali
Survivor and used 202 humans, who had died 2002 with the bomb attack into Bali, reacted annoyed about the judgement for the latter the instigator, who was in court placed, since Umar Patek of her opinion should be shot after under martial law.
Patek, which was scarcely ten years as one of most wanted people of Southeast Asia on the escape, was condemned yesterday for its role with the building by explosives for the bomb attack to a detention by 20 years.
With suspension of sentence it could after 15 years will dismiss.
The 45-year old was injured the mass murder for guiltily found because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist quarter of Kuta, with which 202 humans died, among them 88 Australians, and many further.
In addition a verdict of guilty took place in a number of terrorism-referred charges, to which in the year 2000 counted a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia at Christmas eve.
The public prosecutor's office had demanded a lifelong detention, even if it had been able to request the death penalty for the man, who is called because of its call masterly bomb farmer also as „Demolition one”.
The decision woke painful memories with June Corteen, a mother from Perth, which lost their 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in devastation arranged by Patek and its co-conspirators before nearly ten years.
With tears fighting she, Patek said to death should have been condemned.
I really mean, he should in the footstep of the other chaps follow.
„One should place it before a shooting command”, said Corteen opposite AAP.
I must live each day with the fact that I will not get further grandchildren and I mean daughters will never more see.
Sari Club was made equal to the ground, when on 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 o'clock an enormous bomb in a small truck exploded, which was parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds in former times a suicide bomber a backpack filled with explosive let explode.
It fell after the attack one month long in coma and „died” three times, while he hung on a life support system.
Hughes said, Patek had earned the same fate like the three of other members of the terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and imam Samudra –, that were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed before four years.
Really, this type should get the death penalty before all different.
It alive to leave – no, gives no reason to leave it alive.
20 years to get, after it killed 202 humans and injured many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber, which in court.
It withdrawed itself almost one decade from the arrest, in January 2011 in the city of Pakistan Abbottabad was however finally taken up, where US-armed forces killed scarcely four months later the former Al Qaida boss of Osama bin Laden.
While the negotiation stated a FBI agent that intelligence reports would have furnished the reference that Patek was in Pakistan, in order bin Laden to meet with the goal of developing the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaida again.
„It did not place itself”, said Corteen.
Until recently it did not show regret for it how much suffering he added other humans.
The judgement was issued the ten-year anniversary ago of the attack in this year, which is committed with commemoration ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
„It will give this year many tears”, said Corteen.
Patek can insert appointment against its judgement still.

Traffic light on continuousred: To latency pay attention
Sometimes a traffic light does not become simply green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light signal is defective.
What is one to then do - at the red light to drive?
If a concerning waited for a long time enough at a red traffic light and is free the crossing, he can drive on, explains the Stuttgart attorney Ralf Becker in the magazine “motorcycle”.
The latency must be “appropriate” however, which can be for each individual case differently laid out.
Becker guesses to endure at least five minutes before from a malfunction of the traffic light is to be proceeded.
Who continues driving despite red light, it must realize itself however that he carries the full debt for an accident caused thereby.
Who waits less than five minutes, perhaps not for a long time, warns Becker waits enough and refers to a resolution of the higher regional court Hamm.
In the case negotiated a driver had ignored and had the traffic light after approximately three minutes continuousred for a negligent red light offence to answer for itself.
The traffic light was not defective, but wrapped around a little later on green.
A driving ban remained for it because of the special situation saved - the fine however not.

Losses of profit with bombard after decrease in the case of delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian airplane and railway manufacturer bombard Inc. announced on Thursday a 15-percent decrease of the net profit, after it by declining orders and distribution were guessed/advised with airplanes in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway section under pressure.
Bombard with seat in Montreal published also no flight test datas for his brand-new airplane of the CSeries and gave no new information over it whether in accordance with the airplane the ambitious schedule in next September into the commercial use can go.
After the maiden flight of test flight things one and a half months ago followed so far only three further starts, which lets it appear questionable whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results stayed behind the prognoses and led to a sharp fall in prices from over eight percent at the stock exchange of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday his evaluation of „outperform” on „sector by form” with this in view that the share possesses into the next course potential limited to two quarter.
„Weaker delivery numbers were expected as far as possible with airplanes, but of the margin development within the transport range we are completely clearly disappointed”, said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We are the opinion that bombard new orders for the CSeries will receive, if the test routine for the airplane progresses.
If however in the coming months no new orders are announced, then we expect that the market the program becomes more sceptical opposite.
Bombard hopes that the airplane row of the CSeries can catapult the enterprise into the lower market segment, which is dominated at present by Boeing and Airbus.
First test flight things were introduced in the March of the public and flew to months-long delays for the first time in September.
But so far obligatory orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, since potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and would like to see whether the statements of the enterprise are applicable regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet passenger plane.
At present there are altogether to 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and societies.
Chairman of the board Pierre Beaudoin gives itself confidently that bombard his goal from 300 obligatory orders to beginning of the commercial use of the jet will reach.
The management insured the program on Thursday in relation to analysts and media in addition, lies in the schedule.
„Test flight things remained not longer at the ground than expected”, said Beaudoin at a telephone conference call and added, during the service life of the airplane ground tests and software updates were set.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to undertake a first flight and attach then one revision period, which we also did.
That happens during the entire flight program.
Second of five test flight witnesses will presumably start in the next weeks, the remaining briefly thereafter, was called it from enterprise side.
Analysts remain nevertheless sceptically whether after the maiden flight the first customer an airplane of the CSeries can take twelve months in enterprise.
Bombard explained, it examine planning for start-up (ICE) and these in the next months will update.
„Slow progressing the flight test – even if they correspond obviously to Bombardiers of internal planning – our opinion encourages that start-up shifts, said on the first quarter 2015” Doerksen.
In the third quarter with end on 30 September Bombardiers net profit fell on 147 million dollar and/or 8 cent per share of 172 million dollar and/or 9 cent per share in the year before.
The adapted earnings per share amount to invariably 9 cent.
The revenue gave way slightly and sank from 4,2 to 4.1 billion dollar.
Analysts had expected, so a profit of 10 cent per share and a revenue of 4.56 billion dollar Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
That world-wide fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates, he delivered 45 airplanes in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fell from 83 airplanes to 26.
The order books in air and space section amounted to on 30 September 32.9 billion dollar and were unchanged thereby in relation to 31 December.
„Within the range the results were appropriate for air and space travel in the context of our defaults, but the low incoming orders and market conditions altogether were disappointing”, said Beaudoin.
The revenue in air and space section fell by 13 percent on two billion dollar.
Bombard, the world-wide largest railway manufacturer, it announced that the revenue in this section rose around scarcely eleven percent to 2.1 billion dollar.
The order books in the transport section amounted to on 30 September 32.6 billion dollar and were easily increased thereby in relation to 31 December.
The profit margin within the range transport was impaired by completion problems with some large contracts.
According to management it will give new defaults for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday the bombarding share gave way by 8,5 percent and was about 4,83 Canadian dollar, after it was also announced that the Google finance executive committee Patrick Pichette will change into the executive committee.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world-wide third biggest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardiers closest rival, announced a ten percent decrease of the quarter profits on Thursday.

Regulations to electronic devices in airplanes remain provisional in Australia
Australian flight passengers must switch also further Tablets and smartphones off with takeoff and landing to loosen despite efforts in the USA, the regulations for such devices.
The US-American federal aviation administration (FAA) makes US airlines possible to change their defaults so that passengers on their devices read during critical flight phases E-Books, videos to see or to play be able, if these are in „the flight mode”.
During the majority of the flight this is already permitted to passengers, but finds it annoying many people that they may not read their E-Books when starting and the landing.
Australian societies observe the decision, to whose conversion the US-American airlines must settle enormous amounts at work, pursue however no direct plans for the change of their regulations.
The air traffic control authority CASA explained likewise, one the announcement will view themselves, stressed however that the restrictions are still valid with the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia.
„the CASA has at present no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on the plane”, was announced.
The topic is subject to regulations, according to which airlines security to maintain at any time and the safety instructions given by cab staff passengers must obey.
Virgin already led and explained its Wi-Fi-Unterhaltungssystems on flights with the CASA of discussions across an expansion of use, one is open for changes, these would have however by the legislator to be initiated.
„We would welcome an examination of the permission of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, after we offer, said now (wireless entertainment) during the flight” a spokesman.
Qantas explained, one with the current regulations will remain until further notice.
„Our present guidelines plan that electronic devices may not be used when starting and the landing, and we to have at present no plans, to change”, explained the enterprise.
The FAA regulations are valid for US-American airlines.
We are interested in developments when regulations, from which passengers can profit, and the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it surely exactly will however always view ourselves.
The decision affects itself at US-American societies depending upon age of the fleet differently.
They must prove that their airplanes can to tolerate and manuals, materials required for training purposes, hand baggage programs as well as customer instruction change the interferences by Mobil devices.
„After an airline confirmed, knows the tolerance of its fleet it to passengers using portable, more easily electronic devices such as Tablets, E-Book-readers and smartphones in each height permit”, announced the FAA.
In rare cases with poor visibility the crew will instruct the passengers to switch during the landing the devices off.
In addition the group recommended to stow heavier devices away surely with takeoff and landing under the seat or in the subjects over the seats.

Scientists could throw more lights on it in which connection stands for the tail whisks of a dog with his tendency.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs wagged the tail more to the right (from view of the dog), while it was with nervous dogs the left side.
But scientists say now that other dogs can these subtle differences notice and to it react.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuro scientist of the University of Trento, said: „With humans is well well-known that the left and right brain half differently to stimuli reacts, the positive or negative emotions cause.”
Here we tried to view to us this with other species.
In addition he noticed that with dogs exactly as with humans the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side and turned around, and that different roles played the two hemispheres with the feelings.
In order to experience more over it, how dogs react to the lateral tail whisks of their animals of the same species, the researchers supervised the animals, while these films of other dogs viewed themselves.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand, why the tail moves times into the one, times in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: „We showed the dogs of films with dogs – either a version true to nature or a silhouette, in order to eliminate diverting other aspects, and we could steer thereby the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
If the animals saw, like an otherwise inexpressive dog (seen by the perspective of the wagging dog out), remained it moved the tail to the right completely eased.
However if the tail inclination was primarily to the left (perspective of the dog, which wags), then its heart rate and it rose looked jerky.
In opinion of professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate intentionally with one another by these movements.
It is rather convinced that the dogs from experience would have learned, with which movements it itself worrying should and when not.
He said: „If one different meetings with other dogs has and a wagging the tail in a direction rather linked with friendly behavior is rather a less friendly behavior produced and the right side, then one reacts to basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the realizations could help owners of dog, veterinary surgeons and coaches to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, Experte for dog behavior and guest scholarship holder at the faculty for veterinary science of the university of Bristol explained, this had not been the first study, with which it was examined whether on the left and on the right was important for dogs.
Last year found a team out of the university from Lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left, if they view an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it concerns a content dog.
In another research work at the university of Victoria in Canada the following stood: „Dogs go rather toward a robot dog, if its, tail wags ` left and not right, instead of becoming jerkily – exactly differently than in the Italian study.”
According to its statement the differences could agitate from there that the dogs in the different studies the animals in the films and/or the robot dogs not when dogs interpreted.
A study, how dogs react to genuine dogs, could help, explained it.
„There are considerable proofs for many different mammals that the two brain halves for different purposes are used, but must many of the details be still determined – and dogs form there no exception”, thus for Bradshaw.
Since its behavior can be noted however simply, it will probably not for a long time last, until we understand, why sometimes the tail moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.

Pledge houses boom in Singapore, since the crisis arrived in the middle class
In a pledge house in the shopping centre Bendemeer in Singapore exchanges Janani Amirthalinga a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings, in order to be able to pay the school fees of their daughters.
„My husband and I have a straight house bought, there put my whole money in it”, say Amirthalinga.
Although she earns each month 3,000 Singapore dollar (approx. 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and its man also works, be sufficient the monthly family income not, describe it.
Actual is demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the indebtedness of the households increases – so largely that VALUE Max, where she made her exchange became this week the third pledge house, which is listed at the Singaporean stock exchange.
Pawning of jewelry is too gotten – 1,300 Singapore dollar in the case of Janani Amirthalinga –, but also nearly as favorable not only a fast way, in order money as an unsecured bankers' loan.
Typically pledge houses in Singapore an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, which lies only scarcely over the 15.4 percent, which requires United Overseas bank, require, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
Pledge houses offer however the advantage that no examination of the credit-worthiness or the income proof is necessary here, why loans are faster than possible with banks.
For this reason millions of humans in the region turn to pledge houses, after families feel the pressure by rising cost of living as well as an increasing household and consumer indebtedness.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credits due to a loose financial policy in the developed marketing areas families with smaller and middle incomes visit pledge houses to adjust with stuttering economy the difference.
This week called the rating agency standard & Poor's increasing household indebtedness, mainly by rising mortgages, a factor of risk for the credit-worthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household indebtedness in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product according to estimate of the agency.
Malaysia still stands with 80 percent of the Gross Domestic Product at the point of the list, a rise of 60 percent in the year 2008.
Political economists worry themselves also because of the high consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which came out this week scarcely from a technical recession.
On Thursday the data showed further existing export weakness and a leaving of the consumer demand.
„Eventually that means that in view of rising costs humans in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income where that is possible always”, says for song Seng Wun, Ökonom with CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highest levels with the gold prices in the last two years still strengthened the trend for the pledging of personal articles, since humans use the opportunity to transform the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore about 70 percent of the pawned articles in the 200 pledge houses of the city state is gold.
The people say themselves: „The gold price looks good, lets us Großmutters gold chain pawn and next month back bring.”
The largest Thai pledge house operator, EasyMoney, experienced a 20-percent customer increase in his branches in the last months.
Growth in the pledge business is so strong that VALUE Max, would like to expand Betreiber of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 further in Singapore not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the enterprise operates four houses –, but also outside of Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of VALUE Max.
The enterprise finances with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollar, which took it this week with the initial public offering in Singapore.
During some creditors because of high interest rates in the crossfire are guessed/advised, explain Yeah that pledge houses would not only offer more favorable interest than other lenders, but also not directly the debts increased.
„Customers beleihen articles, which already possess them, and which liquefaction of personal objects of value does not describe increased the Haushaltsverschulung”, it.
The pledge borrowing business is accepted socially increasingly as short term, secured financing.
Also not all humans are, the pawn shop use, in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore come also into the branches of VALUE Max, in order to pawn gold bar and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
To us customers come from each social layer.
„To it belong wealthy ones, which borrow something at short notice for a business or an investment, or small enterprises, which must bridge bottlenecks in the cash-flow”, say Yeah.
Sometimes they need also simply only very fast money.

Rank-pitchscold for refs: Mane no swallow king
Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of federal league table leader Red Bull Salzburg is also so content, then disappointed the director of sport of the “bulls” appeared from the arbitrators.
“There is at present a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of swallow kings”, took it the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
Recent cause for Rangnicks criticism was yellow for Mane with the 3:0 against Grödig on the past Sunday, at which the Senegalesen an alleged acting became the calamity - which was certainly none, as the TV-pictures showed.
“A crass wrong decision”, meant rank-nods, the arbitrator Harkam as “completely overtaxed” designated.
Harkam besides “to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig Coach Adi Hütter after the portion would have contributed its part”.
It defended its German compatriot decidedly: “There I would have behaved in each individual situation equal as Roger Schmidt”.
Schmidt does not want to have had a contact with its colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I would not know, why.
“I am that, which was insulted”, stressed the 46-year old.
In view of the success run rank-nods however a praise hymn was correct on.
“For it there are only two words: Correctly well”, he stated.
There is not much to suspend.
Above all the way, how the crew plays, is impressing.
That is to continue calmly in such a way.
It will hardly give changes of cadre in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change something.

Transport minister Baroness Kramer said, the project „Great Britain together will more near bring”.
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown explained, it was very much pleased to work with the British government about this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and West Midlands.
After conclusion of phase 2 it will give to connections after Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government corrected the estimated costs of the building of the high-speed route between London and North England of 32,7 billion pound on 42,6 billion pound.
The British government, that stands in discussions with transport Scotland, assigned HS2 Ltd. to look for further distance capacities and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
In addition the possibility belongs less travel time from finally three hours or from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: „Our goal for HS2 is a really national route network, the Great Britain and its cities more near brings together.”
We precede with HS2, because it brings enormous advantages with itself.
Without it we stand before a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it concerns also the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which are improved owing to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commentated: „The today's announcement is a good message for Scotland.”
In the name of the Scottish government Keith Brown Carmichael requested to use itself „unmistakably” for the Scottish integration into the HS2-Netzwerk.
Brown said: „In addition, the high-speed railway connection saves the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, at the same time supplies the resource of Scotland an argument for fast railway connections to all of Great Britain.”
Therefore we are pleased to work and the options for a high-speed railway connection in Scotland examine as partners of the British government, the advantages for all create and the connection Glasgow Edinburgh supplemental, which already plans the Scottish government.
I look forward to check the investigation report together with the British Ministers in the next year and to decide the next steps.

Live with future prospect
Actually Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Their house lies in a calm residential area of Stuttgart with much green, an old tree existence, nice neighbour and also not all too much traffic.
Into the city there is only few minutes with public means of transport.
“You have hopefully no fear of spiders? ”, Waltraud Ries asks and points to a fat spider at the door frame.
I look for already for some time a new apartment for my man and me.
But you know, how is difficult in Stuttgart.
The reason is however no spider phobia, but the concern not to be able to master at the age the many stairway steps to the house and in the apartment no more explains it.
Besides: Since a meniscus operation the woman in her fitties at the own body had to experience, what means it to induce itself with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently only a book of it is published to the topic 'happy lives in the age - which apartment form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of it, what does not go at all, begins in the age' it to tell.
When it pulled more than 20 years ago with its man into the May sonnet apartment, it was simply only a beautiful apartment in the middle in the country.
Today with center fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently of it.
In addition, she knows that she belongs to few humans, who argue at all with the topic 'living in the age'.
Most displace it, as long as it goes.
In each case anderen' one, say they become old grinning quietly.
Only if the psychological strain is really large, one thinks.
'Then it can be in addition, to late', already so Ries.
In her book the interior decorator presents 17 patterns of dwelling for self-determined living in the age.
'Which apartment form one selects however, is always an individual decision', explains it.
D i.e. solution does not give it for the age.
Even who can afford the age resting seat in Tuscany or Brittany, it should itself always considers that he also suffer become can.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language,' the specialist book authoress Aussiedlungswilligen gives to consider vereinsame one also in the Dolce résumé.
Under their models are classical support models, alternative apartment forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At the age everyone has so its spleens and defects
'For me so a group house would be however nothing', means it with a winking.
Already not at all as in a student WG with a common bath and a kitchen.
'At the age one needs simply also its retreat areas', thus Ries.
The fact that a senior group house can function nevertheless does not want to exclude the book authoress nevertheless.
That must run then however differently than in the classical student WG.
And sometimes one wants simply only its Ruhe', believes her.
With this opinion it does not stand at least in the state capital alone there.
'Most old humans in Stuttgart want so for a long time it go in their own apartment remaining', are also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the chief the civil services the lives in the age of the state capital.
Their agency advises humans around the topic 'old becomes round'.
Therefore straight older humans would accept frequently also to inconveniences and restrictions to be able to remain only in order in their used to environment that are also the experience of the foundation goods test.
There are today many possibilities of arranging the house or the apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all, which concern themselves with the agefair change of their house or their apartment, to inform for a start thoroughly and not to assign the firstbest craftsman.
Today there are specialists also for the agefair change.
Even in the rented flat let yourself or others realize, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior decorator clears up.
But always the existing apartment cannot be transformed agefairly and thus barrier-free, even if it lies still so beautifully.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
One could install a stair lift within the apartment, the way to on the housing door, likewise paved with stairs, would be however the by far larger obstacle.
It will continue searching, until she found the ideal object for itself and her man.
Of the move it has a horror it more than of the spider at their housing door.

Cocaine-dependent lawyer, the drug boss before police determination warned, must in the prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information on at underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer had fear, its secret drug addiction could to the light come
He was condemned by the Liverpooler Crown Court to three years prison
A well-known defence counsel, who warned a drug lord before a large police determination, because he had fear, its secret drug addiction could is uncovered, became to three years detention condemned.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations to its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine craze.
Lawyer with the nickname, praised of criminologists as „first-class a”, „the Bash” was arrested 2011 in its house, after the police had supervised Scarborough, which it had represented in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed, like Scarborough (32) three bags cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, delivered, while this was with colleagues with a meal of the bar association.
The investigations brought to light that Ditta consumed regularly drugs of the class A, after with tests traces had been found by cocaine in its hair, on its wallet and at credit cards.
During one period of eight months between January and August 2011 he tried to procure without permission information about the arrest of two men on behalf from Scarborough and one its partner.
All four suspects were supervised at that time by the police in the context of a large preliminary investigation to heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and west Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people were later arrested it, after the police guaranteed with a set of house searches heroin and cocaine in the value of 1.5 million pound as well as 200,000 pound at cash.
Ditta, 42, continued to give to the criminal ones, because he was afraid, its drug addiction to information can become public.
Today Ditta, which works for the chancellery Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at the Liverpooler Crown Court was found and condemned in a three-week procedure in two charges because of handicap of the law for guilty.
It admitted the cocaine possession with an earlier questioning.
The lawyer was transferred, after the police found out with its investigations against Scarborough that this had confessed in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta.
Two investigators followed suspecting and saw, how he went to Dittas house and put the drugs with a purity there of 60 percent in a black gulf glove under the garbage can of the lawyer.
Briefly after it had delivered the drugs, Scarborough telephoned regularly with Ditta, which was during dinner in the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood park.
The lawyer returned home, got themselves the drugs and then nine reports between the two was exchanged.
In court it became admits that Ditta was „a regular consumer” from cocaine, after with tests drugs of the class A in its hair, its wallet and on its credit cards had been discovered.
Ditta was arrested later, denied however to take cocaine and said, he had spoken its discussion with the presumed dealer, because this is its mandator, and maintained, is subject „to the attorney-client privilege”.
While Ditta took its wallet to its arrest and tried to remove a set from credit cards to but they were guaranteed and a hair sample was taken from it.
For the police questioning it indicated, it operates both by its private address and on the job an office and a mandator it at home because of legal affairs would call.
In court admits that he it had called and about it had informed important participants of the drug trade, from whom he had represented before some after important arrests, what the investigators knew about her.
Public prosecutor Anne Whyte said: „A criminal law lawyer should know better than all different that one does not break the law.”
Ditta is accused the abuse of its position as a defence counsel, since he admitted himself too much with certain mandators.
The questionable relationship is not simple a drug dealer, but a drug dealer, who supplies its lawyer with drugs.
A part of its reports was certainly legitimate, because he was a lawyer of these people.
But went the far beyond borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and mandator.
It worked against the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could follow further to their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta brought with it his profession in disrepute.
It was close to certain mandator too, in particular Scarborough, and he permitted it that its independence was compromised.
Ditta pointed each failure from itself and stated: „If I a corrupt lawyer would be, which I am not, and information at Scarborough to pass on wanted, then I would not wait 15 hours, but that immediately do.”
But after the hearing superintendent said Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire: „Mr. Ditta has to acquire the step from a defence counsel to a criminal one in the moment done, when he began, drugs from organized criminal ones to.”
Its cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromising and made it sensitive to the motives of prominent members of the organized crime, which it assigned to catch up valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards at integrity and provide in the public for confidence and confidence.
Ditta was issued this confidence and tried to entrench itself behind the front of its profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which led also to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and law handicap, which underlines our determination to bring criminal ones in court.
This case should be criminal ones a warning and shows that no can withdraw itself from the arm of the law.
We find you and bring you in court.
Scarborough was condemned to 14 years prison, after he had explained himself the conspiracy as heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade for guilty.
Thirty-five further at the drug trade beteiligte'Personen to total penalties by 153 years because of drug offenses were condemned.
On its website published Ditta a range with questions and answers over itself, in which he indicated, its dream job is too represented it, as a lawyer mandator in the death cell in America, its ultimative guest during dinner is Mohammed Ali and Chancenungleichheit is the motivation for its work.

Advice takes railway tracks in its sights
Is the railroad overpass to be converted “at deer” the complex, in order to increase the road safety?
Yes, the local councils decided.
Scold oh for it 220,000 euros must take into the hand.
The German Railways wants to improve the Kinzigtal railroad line in the coming year.
Particularly thereby security at railroad overpasses is to be increased - regularly it comes country widely to collisions of courses with other vehicles.
If the communities the structural alteration measures agree, they must take part with a third in the costs, the rest divide course and federation.
Of scolding ACH architect-general Roland Grießhaber described the characteristics of the Bahübergangs to the local council “to deer”.
There the city plans to build at height of the local tunnel mouth west the railway lines a projection.
There also larger vehicles, for example such, could the long trunks transport, with oncoming traffic stand, without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber suggested from there designing a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the following road at given time, in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This discussed in the local council controversially, there some advice the necessity for a road spreading impugned: Thomas Kipp brought the tendency of the critics with his expression on the point: “Having we because of so few vehicles so much money into the hand to take?”
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railroad overpass “deer” is used regularly for long trunks transportation.
Even wood from the range “cow brook” is partly transported over this distance, because up to 20 meters could not use long vehicles the distance to the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main street.
Beyond that serve the distance as bypass for those vehicles, which may not use the tunnel, if the main street is closed, argued Haas.
Since it is to be foreseen that Kirchberg and lock mountain tunnels would have to be converted and reorganized, how this is in wolf oh the case at present, can come to the railroad overpass “to “deer” also for a longer period an important traffic meaning.
The advice agreed, examine to leave, the widening envisaged of the road would cause which costs.
Regardless of its change of the railroad overpass by the majority affirmatively under the condition that the necessary retaining wall is built in such a way that the city can remove the following road direction “Bahnhofstraße” if necessary for meeting traffic on approximately 5.5 meters.
The change of the railroad overpass with the tannery cozy wine could lead to against it completely different problem, which concerns the approach road in the strongly rising “Geroltzhäuser way”.
The administration had let examine the change plans of the course of the engineer's office Breinlinger, since it had doubts about it whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser of way was still easily possible then.
The investigation came to the result that it was not to be excluded that inclination conditions of the road could lead to the fact that longer vehicles mount.
The responsibility for this carries again the city as road construction load carrier.
The change can therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and bending in the current development condition functioned, one was not to agree the change of the railroad overpass, argued Haas.
Also here the risk of a collision of the course with a vehicle standing on the transition is clearly smaller than at the other railroad overpasses, because beside it the critical point center is directly, to which a good line of sight connection exists.
Even courses from the main station would have to be already so far braked here that no collision threatens.
By the majority the change of this railroad overpass the agreement refused, there the city scold oh the problem with mounting vehicles “to pay for would have”, so the advice, since the course can withdraw itself after conclusion of the construction work from the responsibility.
As unproblematic the committee regards the changes at the railroad overpasses “before hay brook” and “before cow brook”, for which crossing agreements were already met with the course.

The conclusion of this procedure, which represents strictly speaking the first stage of the destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule, which aims at the destruction of all chemistry weapons of Syria to in the middle of 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria cannot produce new chemistry weapons more.
Damascus must begin however still to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions there are about 1,000 tons at chemicals and weapons in the country, to which also mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin count.
The announcement came at a time, when on Thursday fights in the city Safira took place, from which experts says that it gives a production facility for chemistry weapons as well as stores here, how communicated the monitoring centre for human rights, Syrian in Great Britain resident.

The conflict forced about two millions of people to the escape from the country.
Assad's troops fight for weeks in Safira against the rebels, from whom many connections to Al Qaida groups have.
The monitoring centre said, on Thursday however no details had given, called losses on both sides.
The fights underline the danger, the chemistry weapon inspectors are exposed to which, because their mission for the liberation of Syria from its poisonous weapon arsenal is running against the time in the midst of a raving civil war.
According to statement of the OPCW, which co-operates closely with the United Nations, the team is now convinced „that it saw all important production and mixture/filling facilities specified by Syria and saw their destruction.”
Therefore „at present no further inspection activities are planned.”
The inspectors had explained beginning of the week, they would have concluded the first round of the examinations and would have visited 21 of 23 from of Damascus indicated places.
Because of security doubts the visit of two facilities not possible was, said the inspectors.
On Thursday the OPWC, the two locations explained according to Syrian statement „… and the objects of the chemistry weapon program had been given up to other facilities mentioned had been shifted, were examined.”
It was not immediately clear whether the place was in Safira one of the two facilities, which could not visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemistry weapons, to which next month by the executive committee of the OPWC must be approved.
„I pull the hat before the bravery and the courage, you all with fulfilling the most provoking mission, which was implemented ever by this organization, to have shown”, explained Ahmed Uzumcu, the general manager of the control organization in one of OPCW to published comment.

RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
Two resellers from their foreign exchange department suspended Royal Bank OF Scotland, so two people, who are familiar with the situation; this is a further indication for the fact that the world-wide official determination takes up to the presumed manipulations at the currency market rapidly at trip.
Some the largest banks of the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they co-operate with the authorities with the investigations in the world-wide largest financial market, on which daily 5.3 Billiarden US Dollar the owner change.
The two resellers would be the first RBS employees, who were suspended in the expanding investigation, which the scandal draws around the Libor Interbankengeschäft.
The bank, which did not deliver a comment to the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
„Our investigations to this topic continue and we to cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities”, said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month indicated to the situation intimate people that the RBS the recordings of emails and Instant Messages, which were sent by and to a former reseller to the British supervisory authority, which passed Financial on Conduct Authority.
This reseller, Richard Usher, had left and is the RBS 2010 in the meantime of his present position as European directors/conductors of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan to have been given time off.
Rohan Ramchandani, Leiter European spots of the Trading with Citi, was given time off this week and Matt Gardiner, early leading currency reseller with Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
This reseller any failure was accused none.
To the Instant to message group of Usher banker belonged with Barclays and the Citigroup, said to the situation intimate people.
UBS announced this week that it had undertaken steps against some their employees, after regulatory authority Finma had explained Swiss that it examines a presumed manipulation of the foreign exchange market with a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities world-wide – the European commission, Finma, Swiss competition regulator Weko, the FCA, the US-American Ministry of Justice and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – concern themselves at present with reproaches, according to which bankers are to have denied themselves with transactions at the currency market.
In addition HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse introduced internal investigations or to information requests received from authorities, said with the situation people trusted.
Banks comb Instant Messages and emails from several years in the search for cases of failure.
The resellers shifted the news over these investigations in a range in riot, which heard in the last years to one of the most profitable Trading units of investment banks, but this year under pressure, because low volatility limits the opportunities for speculators with currencies.
Some bankers tried to play the affair down and said that it is almost impossible, the expanded and high-grade liquid foreign exchange market to manipulate, but prominent resellers are the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
A prominent reseller noticed that despite the enormous daily volume in the foreign-exchange trading the fragmentation of the liquidity between the different commercial platforms and the increasing employment of own internal platforms lead by banks to the fact that „one can affect the market with very small ticket prices”.
The message came out on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced, it this week to a reseller of its London Exchange Traded lost property office quit, after it had caused end of last year a loss of scarcely six million dollar.
The bank informed promptly the responsible authorities and co-operates with them.
„We are sure that the reseller acted alone and that the affair is dammed”, explained Credit Suisse.

Coulson used telephone Hacking for examining a hint
The earlier news OF the Word publishers Andy Coulson used allegedly „telephone Hacking, monitoring and confrontation” with the attempt to confirm a wrong hint over an affair of the Minister of the Interior at that time Charles Clarke.
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained the World to the court in the old Bailey, news OF in May 2005 a wrong rumor to that effect heard that Clarke would have a relationship with its „attractive special advisor” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper assigned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mails and pursued it, but Coulson also called it and left news, as the court experienced.
„In the opinion the public prosecutor's office Coulson, which is now publisher of the NotW, is not anybody, which stands and hopes before the apartment of people to surprise her in the act but one, the people gladly with a history confronts, around their reaction to see”, explained Edis.
He said, to NotW uses three procedures, in order to investigate to stories investigatively: Telephone Hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously white it of second, the monitoring, differently can be it.
How does it look with first?
Knowing it over the telephone Hacking?
It denies, but say we: „And whether he knew of it.”
Rumors over an affair Clarkes were taken up first by the feature editorship by NotW, when one said to a source, which was interested in Pawlby sexual: „Wasting you its time, it is together not with Charles.”
A volume with voice mails of their telephone of at least three causes was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
In addition the investigators found entries on the computer of the detective, on whom Pawlby and their sister were stored as „projects”.
In the time, when the searches ran, grandparents received anonymous calls, in which they were asked for information about them, from Pawlby explained Edis.
Meanwhile the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby.
On 18 June 2005 Coulson left a voice mail with the following contents to it: „I have a story, which we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I gladly with Charles to speak would like.”
Edis explained, Coulsons activities with this story followed to the same sample as for instance with other important personalities, the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted because of an affair with a married woman, when he was associated with the codefendants Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny with others to have conspired to chop between 3 October 2000 and 9 August of 2006 telephones.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the telephone Hacking.

Early puberty: Faster to be arisen
Afro-American and Hispanic girls reach tendentious rather puberty as their white contemporaries, how investigations show.
Physical changes do not mean yet directly puberty
There is no proof for the fact that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe, epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less pronounced with boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist, which specialized in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be anxious, if already at the age of seven or eight years breasts and shame hair grow their daughter?
At the annual conference of the pediatrician federation American Academy OF Pediatrics Florida, the pediatric Endokrinologe Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained this week in Orlando, that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
„I spend much time to calm parents down – normally that is not a sign for the fact that now fast puberty enters”, described Kaplowitz.
Obvious announcements of the development, like for example increasing breasts, shame and axilarry hairs as well as body odor, show up with girls in former times.
Nevertheless there was only an easy shift with the age of the Menarche (arise to the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States the average age is appropriate for less than 12.75 at 12.5 years, somewhat in the year 1970.
„If the development of the breasts begins, lasts it still at least two to three years up to the Menarche”, said Kaplowitz, also author of the book „early puberty with girls: The essential guide to handling this frequently arising problem”.
Time is the most exact test, as puberty progresses.
It is disputed, which actually represents the beginning of puberty, but is valid it „for premature”, if the chest enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before an age of eight years.
The process in most cases slows down or stagnates – to something, which a pediatrician can supervise exactly.
With faster progressing tests could be shown by a Endikronologen, so that serious problems can be excluded such as tumors or cysts.
There are working methods for delaying an early menstruation and the protection against of another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can lead ultimatively to growth inhibition and thus small body stature with adults.
The recommendations for a medicamentous or hormoneal therapy orient themselves at the age of the child, the development speed, which growth rate and the emotional ripe one.
Psychosocial aspects are likewise important.
Kaplowitz is reserved, which concerns medicines, but he grants: „Suppressing puberty can moderate behavior problems and the feelings of girls to be different than their contemporaries.”
The other large problem is understandable: Parents would not like simply that their very young daughters have the period.
„You worry yourselves because of the pregnancy risk or over it, like them the hygenic side handle”, said Kaplowitz.
„It was a shock”, remembers a woman, whose daughter with ten got her days.
Even if there were first signs and we had spoken about menstruation, them were emotional preparatory.
She came scared and excited from the school home, because it was first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But no conclusive proofs are present for the fact that hormones would be causal in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Young ones come similarly as girls in former times into puberty.
Kaplowitz is the opinion, the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
It supported the execution of a study in the year 2001 over girls at the age of six to nine years, which manufactures a connection between adipose and the entering puberty.
Other investigations support this conclusion, but it gives many other factors, which played a role.
In this country Afro-American and Hispanic girls reach tendentious rather puberty as their white contemporaries.
There are for it different explanations.
Early puberty seems global to be affected by all possible things, from economic conditions over the climate up to the genes.
A further mystery: Although the face and shame hair coat grow boys already in former times, the trend is not as pronounced to full-extent earlier puberty as with girls.
Other physicians to the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
Emerging of acne and shame hair is even common with babies and infants.
„We must be careful, like we the true beginning of puberty identify”, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe at the Goryeb Children's hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to leave itself advised by their pediatrician as they should speak with their child.
„That can mean that one expects in former times than a discussion lead must”, guessed/advised Kaplowitz.
If one remains calm, the child reacts normally well.
Girls, who bloom early, need the insurance, who are the process a normal part of the life, even if it in former times than meant enter.

Before the district derby against Schalke traveled BVB supporters with flares had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund quit thereupon hard consequences on.
Before the Fridays play the Ultras reacted to the soccer federal league against the VfB Stuttgart with a silence - first.
It was unusual, nearly already eerie acoustics, which were offered to the viewer to shortly before the kickoff of the Bundesliga play between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
To hear the guest fans with their singing were predominant.
The south grandstand against it, where the most faithful faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented itself first unusually quietly: No singing, no whoops.
The landing of the Capo, which coordinates otherwise the common first fire mixture, remained vacant.
And on the grandstand lonely a large flag with label “section stadium prohibition” blew completely in front.
Only as goal keepers Roman Weidenfeller like always as first BVB players the place entered, broke brief jubilation up.
When its crew colleagues followed, there were loud singing and blowing scarves - however do not lengthen everywhere.
In the central blocks nothing moved 12 and 13 of the south grandstand.
Also that Stadionsprecher Norbert Dickel enumerated again the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over arsenal, prolongation of a contract of coach Jürgen Klopp -, did not provide for celebration mood.
Only five minutes before the kickoff the Capo its landing ascended - and by then almost the strain seizable with hands unloaded itself in a loud cry, when Dickel queried like used to the tendency on ranks in the stadium.
As the latter always was like the south grandstand at the row - and finally was here again like used to the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest as with kickoff of the south grandstand the loud request “derby winner rises” came, was again everything like always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Directly before district derby with the FC Schalke 04 some traveled the BVB supporter flares had met into spectator ranks and on the place fired - and nearly goal keeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The play was late whistled for the start because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had the points of the Dortmunder Ultras thereupon in its office received - and one believes Watzkes words, was this for the fan representatives a rather uncomfortable date.
“It will give, announced solid cuts for the entire ultra movement” the BVB boss on Thursday evening on a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As immediate measure Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
“I forbade, explained that” he.
We cannot give the zero-tolerance politics up in things pyrotechnics.
Besides the Ultras different possibilities of a punishment were pointed out - up to Tuesday to have these now to time of deciding for one.
Otherwise, thus Watzke, will specify the BVB to end the coming week a sanction.
“That becomes drastic”, insured Watzke.
One may be curious, as the reactions on the south grandstand fail then.

What happens on the way with my email?
Email is called actually electronic letter.
With the draft of the Internet service was email converted similarly as technically at the conventional post office the secrecy of letters?
With the conception of the early Internet services was the center of attention to make possible communication.
Therefore one did not pay attention with basic technical minutes to create a stable foundation for a listen to-safe exchange of letters.
Therefore a conventional email corresponds rather to an open postcard as a sealed letter.
If user “Anna” sends a mail to “Benni”, are the computers of the two then directly connected?
The email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail in the first step to the mail server of her service provider.
If it has for example an GMail account, would be Google.
This mail server sends contents to the provider, which Benni uses.
On the distance the mail can run over some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can call contents then with its provider.
Are conventional emails on their way read too by the net?
Most mails are read on the way several times from software robots.
With the provider of the sender it is usually examined whether the mail leads a harming program as appendix with itself.
On the receiver systems a virus check is likewise made.
In addition the providers examine whether it concerns an annoying and unwanted Spam mail, which is directly deleted or away-sorted at least into a Spam folder.
Do the robots have still another further task?
In systems like GMail the robot determines also the information, which Google needs for placing context advertisement.
If Anna and Benni communicate by GMail over her coming holiday trip, Google can fade in appropriate left to holiday offers.
Do also unknown humans read too the emails?
The probability that unauthorized people read too a mail, is extremely small.
Theoretically is however possible.
In companies frequently administrators have the possibility of reading too electronic post office.
Also the law enforcement agencies and secret service have legal possibilities of intercepting or of taking to the knowledge emails.
In addition possible illegal espionage actions come.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading too?
With an encoding after the OpenPGP standard an email can be coded effectively against reading too.
At high technical expenditure it is also possible to mask the meta data of email communication so that easily it cannot even be recognized who with whom communicated.
Are Yahoo and Google on the email market how important in Germany?
With the mainly privately used p.o. boxes Yahoo and Google play a subordinated role according to an investigation of Convios consulting from August 2013 only.
While the portions of Yahoo mail were last fallen, could add GMail of Google clearly.

Of Germany largest regional church one offensive-started, in order to promote for the profession of the minister.
Background is a possible lack of minister: The Evangelical-Lutheran regional church Hanover counts on the fact that the number of their will halve itself at present approximately 1,800 ministers and ministers according to current situation to 2030.
For young people today the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said minister Mathis Burfien (43) in the discussion with the protestant news service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and routine of the day.
Burfien the regional church for the first time assigned a minister on a full place to inspire young people for the theology study.
At present less and less young people decide after the Abitur to study theology.
Burfien attributes this to the process of the Entkirchlichung: “God voice is quiet, the world is loud”.
The profession of large freedom and variety is coined.
I am master of my calendar and can my emphasis set, where it is important to me.
Ministers could be completely close as pastors with humans.
They earned so much like teachers and could well on it live.
Surely in the free economy more one pay, but theologians would have a safe employer.
That comes to meet the young people today, those it not only around career, but go around a sense-fulfilled work.
To information at present approximately 60 ministers go to the regional church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, into the retirement per year.
At the same time about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their Vikariat.
In thinly populated peripheral areas like the resin, which can become Emsland or the turning country in the future it difficult to occupy places.
Burfien wants to organize and to it also well-known people invite among other things study days for young people, which studied theology.
The theology study offers broad training.
One can become thereby even Federal President.

Hearing before the royal commission: Two YMCA employees before accusations against Jonathan Lord accused of sexual crimes
Two YMCA employees from new South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual crimes in connection with children, before 2011 reproaches were raised against the child male nurse Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the royal commission for sexual abuse of children experienced.
But during the opening explanation before the commission the YMCA had explained, one had never had to do „in the organization with an incident from sexual child abuse to”.
Managing director Phillip Hare was asked over a case, with which an YMCA employee had been accused of offences with child pornography, and another, with which a PE teacher of the YMCA Caringbah resound 1991 children entrusted because of the abuse to it one had condemned.
Shed said Gail Furness, one the commission assisting attorney the fact that he knew from the first case which however did not know second.
It granted, the opening explanation of the YMCA in relation to the commission likewise inaccurately in the statement was, „it external examinations of the YMCA gave, in which the YMCA was recognized as foremost front with child safety”.
Proofs before the commission show rather that the YMCA was informed about the fact that it received the secondarylowest evaluation from four possible in a quality audit the department of the OF Education and Communities (ministry of education) in the August of the year.
Shed, which began with 21 with the YMCA, granted, the management „from me to downward” during the attitude of lord failed and did not guarantee that employees realized themselves their obligations to announce offences against the guidelines to child safety.
Lord had been condemned at the beginning of the year because of sexual offences at twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was condemned to at least six years prison.
It sheds denied however that the YMCA would have a cultural problem, which had held employees to announce lords of offences regarding the security from children to.
The employees stated, they would have offences observed, among other things that lord was alone with children, her privately as baby sitters cared for, them on its lap to sit let, to one said the fact that he had it dear and to play let children with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was lord and who had asked for a training to the child protection, because she was anxious because of its behavior, stated that the child service chief Jacqui Barnat, which was in the YMCA Caringbah the superior lord was very more unapproachable „much intimidating and most time”.
The managing director explained, he statements of employees would not accept, according to which these would not have dared to refund its superior message.
Instead, then he said, rather its friendship with lord its faculty of judgement impaired, why they would not have announced him.
It sheds explained, it communicated its opinion to the executive committee of the YMCA NSW that the lesson, which has to draw the organization from „the Jonathan lord incident” „an announcing” by employees of references, and the executive committee does not have it agreed.
Shed said, the decision, the employees for the signing of secrecy obligations shortly after occurrence of the accusations to urge, by the managing director of the child services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley was met.
He said, thus should a contaminating of the proofs be prevented, what had been badly converted however „overeagerly” and.
The YMCA NSW was in the time, when Jonathan Lord was busy between 2009 and 2011 there, none for children safe organization, explained professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, Experte for sexual child abuse, the commission.
It described that it had given „serious problems” with the attitude, examination, training, training and supervision of the employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.

Tourism: Descent to the Romans
On approximately 120 m is received to Cologne a sewer from the Roman time below.
Who visits Cologne, does not go past at the cathedral.
Approximately 157 meters rise up the two towers into the sky and make it the second highest church building of Europe.
But only few visitors, who admire the two delicate steeples, suspect that there is a quantity to discover also under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is expert in things Cologne underworld.
Meeting place for its guidance is direct the service center of Cologne tourism at the cathedral.
The tour begins completely more unspectacular: “We catch in the underground parking on”, say Schulze.
In the seventies the city fathers wanted a auto+fair city, and therefore only that stopped from the remains of the old city wall, which was not too large.
Most users of the multi-storey car park rush therefore today also at the Roman remnants and turn off only their car.
But who looks more exactly, in the parking deck an archaeological place of discovery separated by metal lattice bars discovers D2.
To see about five meters are high ruins from handplate-large stones.
“There is remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ”, tells Schulze.
Before it goes again back to the daylight, Schulze the participants on the upper park level still another view lets deep pit throw into a dark, 15 meter.
That is the well of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately also hardly noticed.
Next station of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants rise again down into the depth.
We experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north the alps, the Prätors of the CCAA.

“The abbreviation stands for “Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium”, which” means” so much on well German like “city of Roman right and city of the Agrippinenser, based among emperors Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult.

“We are now in the Mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath”, explain it.
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground, in order to come to the groundwater, which was indispensable for ritual ablutions.
Until today different water levels are readable by changing levels of the Rhine in the lower end the Mikvah, whose origins decrease in the respected century.
The Mikvah becomes part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which the construction work is to begin shortly.
Up to the completion however still some years will offense.

George Kerevan: European decartelization gives the choice to the Scots
A new day, a new fright history to independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary, in order to step the Schengen area as condition for the EU membership.
That supplies the keyword for stories over passport checks to Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed in the Strathclyde template to the possible economic advantages, which would bring more freedom to travel in remaining Europe with itself, but played this – as expected – was referred in the headlines no role.
Also nobody mentioned that the EU member states bend into shape frequently their strict rules, if it is more favorable for them.
Since Scotland does not belong at present to the Schengen area, the continued neglect for Brussels would be only a small concession in response for what one wants really from the Scots.
Thus actually no story.
And one, which came already in such a way into the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time has I „independence means passport checks” - duck before at least 40 years belongs.
An interesting point is lost with constant repeating of this age-old history.
Why should one expect from an independent Scotland that it dances after the European whistle?
Why the London yoke against of Brussels exchanges, particularly now?
Those are the real European news: The large plan for the combination of Europe, seized after the war, is guessed/advised in the stagnation.
With the euro crisis the project Europe died officially.
Everywhere in the European Union win parties at ground, which are European Union-hostile or which euros would like to throw as common currency over board.
Even in Germany the euro-sceptical party alternative for Germany – only this year based – could get hold of scarcely five million voices with the election to the Bundestag in September for itself and drive out thus effectively the free democrats (the equivalent to the British liberally Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There was always domestic resistance against the plan to create federalistic Europe.
The current economic crisis turns out however as turning point.
Because of Berlin and the European central bank strict austerity policy in connection with the straitjacket, into which the respective national economy is forced by adherence to the common currency, are many humans of the opinion, the project Europe imposed went too far.
The crisis of the euro has to do a little with the fact that national governments cause excessive budgetary deficits – that was only in Greece the case.
Instead the euro system its members festgenagelt on rates of exchange, which are favorable for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that gladly in such a way.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency south Europe with an inserted productivity disadvantage appears opposite Germany.
The only possibility consists of shortening wages and public expenditures – spurred from Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems a more deeply going European productivity problem lies.
As consequence of Brussels „become green” energy guidelines – a code for the subsidization of French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumers – ordered pay the European industry compared to the United States the double for electricity and the quadruple for gas.
That is an immobilizing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All wage fixing of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry by cheap American slate gas into the corner to be pushed.
As consequence a revolt pulls, up particularly in France, to the former Cheerleader of the European Union.
After the war the political elite of France saw the European Union as a vehicle, with which one could hold Germany in chess and lift Paris eye level with Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris any longer than gate for political authentication and Europe its own economic policy pushed open, with which the fastened French economy has to fight.
The result: Of Marine Le Pen's Front National oriented towards the right and European Union-hostile a straight crucial by-election won and thus the governing socialists to place three referred.
Front National is now the popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes – a time-fair warning for the British labour party that it cannot assume that, a splitting in the right spectrum would mean advantages automatically for the left one.
What makes again popularity among the white Frenchmen of the working class won for Le Pen with their?
She would like to use the European Union-elections next year in addition, an anti-European Union, to forge anti-common currency block in the European parliament.
If the anti EUROPEAN Union parties fare with these elections well – and that is very well possible –, then such a block could dominate the European parliament for the first time.
This is the point, on which I want outside: In too furthermore future will not come together the increasing resentment against the European Union and the common currency for the abolishment of the euro.
The European Union will not disappear, but it will become rather something like „Europe (sovereigns) of the nations”, which favored general de Gaulle.
Perhaps Germany and a few its satellite managing hold to the euro, but France and south Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain dissociates itself from this project in hope to curry favor itself with the USA.
However Washington's increasing interest in the Pacific area puts close that Great Britain will be located alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland remain with all that?
We can decide to be a region from (in last consequence) small England to.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – to which also belongs to say Berlin and Brussels what it where put itself can.
I assume, Scotland could drive in a looser European group completely well, if we keep our own currency.
Co-operation with other, similarly thinking countries is simpler in föderierten Europe of the nations.
Otherwise we should consider to follow suit it to Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland actual remarkably – most successful political movement against the austerity policy in Europe and has 2011 a spectacular majority due to the refusal of the suggested (and made) shortening won which, which the labour Minister of Finance Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib the coalition had to answer for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for an independence to only get in order then forced upon of Berlin and Brussels an austerity policy.

FAA: Aircraft passengers can use however electronic devices in airplanes now (no mobile phone discussions to lead)
Airline passengers can hear now from the takeoff to the landing their electronic devices for reading, work, plays, music and viewing films use, however with the mobile phone not telephone, so the new guidelines, which were published on Thursday by the federal aviation administration (FAA) in the USA.
But the passengers should not expect that these changes are converted immediately.
How quickly they were implemented, at a press conference on the respective airline, Michael Huerta would depend explained FAA employees.
The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that the training manuals of the flight crew as well as the regulations for stowing the devices away updated it according to the new regulations.
The FAA explained, her from some airlines plans had already received, which would like to develop the employment of portable electronic devices in airplanes.
Under these airlines were also delta and JetBlue.
„Depending upon condition of the plan we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon”, announced the FAA in an announcement.
At present passengers smartphones, Tablets and other devices must switch off, if the airplane doors are closed.
They may start it only then again if the airplane reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
With the entering the approach flight the aircraft passengers must switch and not be allowed to do it off again them not again start, before the airplane landed.
After the new guidelines airlines, whose airplanes were secured against electronic disturbances, could permit, the devices to their passengers also with start to use landing and on the runway explained the FAA.
Most new airliners and other fliers, which were reequipped for the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights, should correspond to the criteria.
Laura Glading, Präsidentin of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
„If the new regulation surely converted actual and we co-operate in this connection closely with the airline –, both side will profit from it”, to commentated Glading.
We are honestly said it suffering to have to feel us with this topic such as Aufpasser.
Internet connections to surfing, exchange of emails, text news or downloading data under three kilometers nevertheless remained further forbidden, described the authority.
Passengers are requested, smartphones, to shift Tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
Thus still none „Words With Friends”, the Scrabble resembling online game, which the actor Alec Baldwin played 2011 on its smartphones, when he had to leave public-effectively a jet of American Airlines, because he refused itself switching the equipment off while the airplane at the gate was parked.
And heavier devices such as laptops must be also further stowed away, since a danger of injury exists here, if it by the cab fly.
Mobile phone discussions during the flight remain likewise further forbidden.
The adjustment competence for telephone calls is with the federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA possibly waives prohibition for certain electronic devices with takeoff and landing
Mark Rosenker said last month of the road safety authority national Transportation Safety board, security expert for national traffic questions on of CBS news, mobile phone as risk was still regarded.
„Mobile phone are real a problem, only because they could not cause potential disturbances with navigation equipment, but because we know of the FCC that the transmission from air can disturb also transmitting poles”, so Rosenker.
A consulting committee of the industry, which was brought of the FAA for the investigation of this topic into being, recommended last month that the government permits a broader employment of personal electronic devices.
In the last years the pressure increased to the FAA to loosen restrictions for the use.
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri do not hold the opinion, it give valid safety reasons for the prohibition.
The restrictions are also increasingly more difficult to implement, because the use of the devices became pervasive.
In some studies of it the speech which up to a third of the passengers switching the equipment off forgets or ignores, is.
The FAA began 1966 to limit the use of electronic devices by airline passengers after reports over disturbances of navigation and communications equipments through from passengers carried UKW radios admits had become, which represented the newest technology trend at that time.
New airplanes depend by far on electrical systems than earlier generations of aircraft, but they are also in such a way designed and authorized of the FAA that them electronic interference do not constitute anything.
Airlines offer for some years Wi-Fi already to passengers, if the flight altitude is reached.
The fliers adapted to Wi-Fi-systems are also more insensitive in relation to interference.
The vast majority of the passenger airlines should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices after the new guidelines, said Huerta.
The today's electronic devices deliver generally substantially less radio radiation than earlier generations.
He vein for example deliver only minimum radiation, if one turns over.
But with downloading or sending data the transmission values are stronger.
Among the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions for the equipment use by passengers Amazon.com ranks.
2011 loaded company employees a passenger airline of full Kindle he vein and made a test flight, in order to determine problems, could however none determine.
Members of the FAA Beratungskomitees expressed mixed feelings, what concerns the risk with the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger federation national Association OF airline Passengers said, it was the opinion, the disturbance by the devices was genuine, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said, it give only isolated reports of pilots, who would speak for a disturbance of equipment services by the devices, and which were most of it very old.
The committee recommended the FAA however to permit it to pilots to arrange during instrument landing under bad visibility a switching of the devices off by the passengers.
A grouping from the travel branch welcomed the changes and called it reasonable adjustment for travelers, who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
„We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience contradicts to Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association not security”, said.

Jumbo jet visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo jet in the search for the “best ham of the world”: For the TV-transmission “Galileo” visited the Pro7-Star Bonn village.
The spokesman gets straight equal too beginning: The most important for the ham are the pig clubs, turbo-mast is thereby no good condition.
Can ham, which one gets in each supermarket, be thus a quality product?
Uli as a boss of the large ham factory in the Black Forest explains the function of the company “eagle” to jumbo jet in Bonn village.
Of “Germany of dearest ham”, as jumbo jet announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and smock he comes the inside the factory.
Also jumbo jet must disinfect itself for a start the hands, before it may seize to the micro.
Jumbo jet for stabilization with high-speed lunch in forest hat sighted
“Here one works me rießigen quantities”, are astonished the television doers, Black Forest hams as mass product.
16.000 clubs per week speak for itself.
Weight, fat portion, color: Uli explained on which it with the quality arrives.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
Watch television with level?
Also details like the pH value of the meat play a role.
The more darkly the meat, the more highly the pH value.
“There I curious, if its Roberto Blanco measure, what then passed”, so jumbo jet cynical.
Here the level of the private television in pure culture is presented.
But watching is worthwhile itself nevertheless.
The spectator sees that dividing the clubs is further manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is to be found traditional without bones on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing remind jumbo jet optically of a “submarine”.
The trick: Branches of fir provide here in the smoke for the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham finally nearly black.
“Now the disk in the jumbo jet” disappears, announces it the test Verspeisung.
“That is correctly more delicious”, so the result of the TV-star.
Thus all involved ones will be able to live.

With a narrow cadre the Mr. I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to begin in the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.

Soon it showed up however that it, also age-related, with which fast actions of the joy townspeople could keep up not completely.
With the hard and impacts placed the Gönninger had trouble extremely.
Repetitive missed them the passports and attacks passed on by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were with the block defense not to the place.
Two high first sentence gains expressed clearly the superiority of the joy townspeople in all interests.
In view of this crushing and play-determining achievement the third sentence was then won somewhat lackadaisically and desireless to the 3:0-Endstand (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There on 2 November with the TV Baiersbronn, which in gnawing old clearly become generally accepted could, a substantially higher performance opponent on the field will stand.

In UC-let faced each other into the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn the second crews from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt.
They delivered a hard disputed two-hourly match.
Nervousness on both sides caused particularly with the taking of the ball errors and point gifts; also with the passports the precision was occasionally goods in short supply and in some critical play scenes prevented the overeagerness the view for possible point gains.
In this performance-related very balanced meeting the large physical employment and a pleasing commitment of both teams were correct however throughout in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto.

GEC-hung: No absolute protection possible
“We want the inhabitants promptly into planning to merge”, open mayors Jens Häußler the citizen information event to the flood protection concept in GEC-hang.
Approximately 80 participants had come into the community hall to express in order to let the planned measures be explained to place questions doubts and bring in ideas.
Häußler got straight: “The last-finite decisions fell the members of the local council”.
The flood, the GEC-hung to 15. May 2009, unprepared met, a drastic event was, which raised the question about preventive measures for the future, so Häußler.
A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbour community Aidlingen in order, which is now basis for the flood protection concept in GEC-hung.
“The protection as much as possible cultivated properties is the goal”, like that Häußler.
At the basis put planning the protection from a loud German weather service is statistically every 100 years floods which can be expected.
By a 15-percent addition is considered to the climate change.
Among experts this is marked with “HQ 100aKlima”.
The masses of water, which had led 2009 in GEC-hung to considerable damage, corresponded to a 1000-year old flood.
“There is not an absolute protection, but we can obtain a relative improvement”, so Häußler.
In order to obtain the protection HQ 100aKlima, must in GEC-hung approximately four million euros be invested, whereby the community can count on national subsidies at a value of approximately 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out however that it gives the promotion only if a total concept is converted.
In addition the community is dependent on the co-operation of the citizens.
A complex planning and licensing procedure must be completed.
In the best case 2016 can be begun with the conversion.
Among other things sees the protection concept, that in the past week in the local council was already presented (we reported) local measures in the supply of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley forwards.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept the participants used the opportunity to bring in their requests.
Among other things it was questioned why no more dams and retention basins were planned for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kühn, Fachplaner of the assigned engineer's office forest and Corbe from hill home, which presented the concept, that it needs the interaction of all presented measures stressed, in order in the sum the desired goal to reach.
Beyond that one is to be found held the most economical solution, so to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Displeasure prevailed with adjoining owners of the old place, who have suffering even with normal thunderstorm rains again and again under an overloading of the duct system.
The problem is with the administration and first measures was already seized.
Häußler pointed out however that the guidelines for duct systems were others, than for the flood protection and this may not be mixed.
The community is obligated to lay the duct system out in such a way that two to three-year rain events could be borne.
The sewers more largely to dimension, millions would devour.

The again arranged Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One, for staying and coming back in-load.
One, which would like to make the name the program.
Déjà Vu one calls a psychological phenomenon, which expresses itself in the feeling, a new situation to have already experienced or see according to lexicon.
In case of the visit of the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town Kleve in range of vision to the university Rhine irrigation channel it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu-feeling.
Finally the café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: an actual stay not only mental to make strongly always recurring experiencable but.
Because it just joke makes and is simply beautiful.
A view in the inner feelings at the Opschlag 8 gives immediately a good feeling to the viewer.
The ultramodern, but does not cool café ambience looks like a place for well-being feeling.
Here the team spoils the guest with most diverse coffee or cocktail variants with the founders Mirjam van the Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the point.
In addition there are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh Baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, already made themselves before the opening the decorations of the café at the Opschlag as gastronomers a name: In crane castle they led “kind lounge”.
From the move to Kleve at the Opschlag the pleasant café lovers more audiences expect.
Not least also by the university.
“Whereby we do not have a certain target audience”, stress Daniel Büttner.
Rather the two here young students would like to respond exactly the same like seniors and all age groups between them.
Apropos café lover.
The sympathetic pair of owners stands behind the coffee benefit.
The smelling hot brew in the most diverse variations themselves enjoys.
Expresso fan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van the Stelt the cappuccino drunkard.
“To it a baguette - that is my thing”, betrays it the NRZ.
There were two of event already in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the port celebration took place rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not profit from it.
But there were also the Ringelnatzabend.
“Beautiful, successfully and funny”, found the two 33-year old.
But especially not everyone thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not also therefore an expressed fan of event evenings: “One can make it just for not all right”.
And with an event I respond in each case, which are interested also in special event.
Therefore event rather the exception with us will be.
“We would like to disturb the completely normal enterprise as little as possible”.
Is to be called: Déjà Vu stands also for reliability.
Regarding the quality of the products, which are ordered here, likewise, as on the team and the beautiful environment at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which develops more and more to a gastronomy mile.
To the joy of many Klever, the guests out near and far and the students, who discover the guest Rome hurry and concomitantly the café Déjà Vu for itself.

Jumbo jet manufacturers argue in the face of large orders about seat width
Between prominent aircraft manufacturers it came to an argument over the width of seats in the tourist class with long-haul flights, which indicates the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai air show this month.
The controversy turns around the seat width, which is offered to passengers during long flights in the tourist class – not always those, for which airlines at most strive, but this proven area places the key for the efficiency statements with the newest airplanes of airbus SAS and Boeing Co. .
Airbus demanded this week a branch standard, which a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 duty) in the tourist class prescribes, but the US-American archrival Boeing says, which the airlines should decide.
The argument comes to one time, since the aircraft manufacturers compete to sell still larger versions of their twin-engine long haul fliers and with the event of 17. until 21 November orders for record expect.
Like the rear part of the airplane decorated actual in particular whether it rows with nine or ten seats gives –, is crucial for the indicated economic results, which new „mini jumbo jet” - design to supply is.
Boeing stated, its modernized „777X” seizes 406 people with seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inch wide and permit in such a way ten per row.
Airbus explained, the competitive version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, whereby there are nine per row.
Airplane giants distribute frequently blows over technical details by means of advertisement in the technical literature.
Now airbus appeals before the Dubai air show, where the 777X will also make a running over 100 orders presumably, directly to the public.
Recently the enterprise presented an announcement, which is the beginning of a new indicator war could and backers a picture showed, in which three people together-squeezed in a restaurant sits, and in addition the title: „You would accept that?”
„Boeing suggests long-haul flights in seats, which are closer than regional turbo Props”, says airbus distribution boss of John Leahy.
In view of changed nutrition habits the people change more thickly, but airplane seats to have not radically.
Between the early 1970ern, when the modern long haul travel defined Boeing 747, and the end of the century the weight of the male average American increased so the data of the US-Ministry of Health between 40 and 49 years by ten percent.
The waist extent of the male average American in 21. Century amounts to according to US-American health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says, its rival adhere to a seat concept from the 1950ern, when the average body extent freshly baptized „jet set” was narrower.
One accomplished, thus airbus, investigations, which proved that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the numbers from airbus to the seat-measured and says, it does not stand not in the discretion of the manufacturers to decide, how the balance between flight tariffs and facility arranges airlines.
The enterprise explains also, according to investigations the experience depends on the plane on more than the seat width.
„It runs out really to give airlines flexibility so that they can do that, what it in her opinion must, to be over successful”, the flight cab expert describes Kent Craver von Boeing.
They would not like that we dictate to them, which makes them for profitable.
They know their business better than every different one.
For aircraft passengers it concerns more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a topic, which can affect the sales.
Behind the argument running stands around airplane orders with an estimated volume from at least 700 billion US Dollar after list prices in the coming decades, which could affect effectively the export balance of the USA or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving strength behind the argument around the new jets.
Both airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat with their newest twin-engine long haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeing to the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design by nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still smaller than with machines with ten seats per row, used at present.
„Boeing squeezes therefore more seat into its airplane, around it our products to make more competitive”, says Kevin Keniston, Leiter for passenger comfort with the European airbus.
On the other hand say analysts, full cabs with ten seats per row with existing 777s pointed on it that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, what with cheaper flight tariffs accompany could.
„Eighteen duty seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic criterion the airbus offer of the threat steered by the 777”, says Mary Kirby, Expertin for cab facility, foundress and publisher of Runway Girl network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers, from which the airlines can select.
The world travelers jet salespersen carry even tape with itself, in order to check the facility with the competition.
Even if they advertize the comfort, then nevertheless all manufacturers offer also to jets with highly compressed arrangement for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen rows, however according to own statement still none sold.
Until recently airbus stressed, like importantly more adaptability of the cabs is and offered for some jets broad seats at the courses.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets experts say the fact that the call will probably deflagrate after a new branch standard but from the wave from 777X-Verkäufen to divert could.

The veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism according to lexicons, differs from this however nevertheless in completely substantial way.
Because during vegetarians this Schlemmereien takes the liberty, does not stand the consumption of layer cake, ice or a strong Edamer not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, beside that renouncement of meat and fish leaves the vegan of the all consumption of animal products off also honey is answered in the negative.
Which remains, one may ask oneself, but on closer inspection the vegane nutrition world is characterised by a considerable imaginativeness.
“Spreads are much like”, explain Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, who holds a variety ready of special products for vegans.
Also Reuben Proctor visits the shop in the cathedral lane gladly.
Since 13 years lives the native New Zealander vegan, in Lampertheim finds he (nearly) everything, which he needs to the life. “placed 1997 I mean nutrition over and became vegetarian”.
Over the turn of the century took place then the next step and I became vegan.
“The conviction did not however only come because of the nutrition, but due to the shoe choice”, says Proctor, which prefers imitation leather normal leather.
It recognized that it goes also in other everyday interests without animal products.
Primarily is vegan its an ethics.
“I do not want that animals for me must die”, express Proctor the maxim of the vegans, who extend to the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of Burgern to afterwards-mourn scrambled eggs or rubber bears the vegan discovered fast completely new products, rose the enthusiasm.
“It is not a double bonus”, says Proctor today, “actually represents vegan its renouncement, no asceticism, but it is an enrichment”. The acceptance that one reduces the selection of food options with the nutrition conversion, attributes Proctor rather to the power of the habit.
And exactly these conditioning let some still so well meant attempt fail also.
“The craze factor is a completely crucial factor, which lets many give up fast, similarly as when smoking”, sets up to Proctor a comparison.
And objects: “Certain tastes are not at the animal to fasten”.
Often there is the spices or the kind of the preparation, which constitute the taste.
“One can produce in addition, in other way the same effect”, clarifies the vegan.
To a barbecue Proctor bring along for example eggplants, mushrooms and also a few Veganwürste.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied nutrition, with which it is to taste quite also once hearty.
Naturally one would like to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
“It is to taste, but that is not only to animal food to reduce”, like that Proctor.
, He did not suffer health damage up to eating disorders, a further widespread acceptance.
For me the conversion had a positive aspect.
I do not take up strange cholesterol and have a increased vitamin portion.
There are high speed athletes, which exclusively nourish themselves vegan.
“My blood values are in the best way, I can often be checked”, betray Proctor.
In particular before the lack of vitamin many Vegansimus critics warn B12.
“There animals with animal feeds to be fed, instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat, which one buys in the cooling chest, which is high Vitamin-B12-Anteil”, finds Proctor.
For vegans give it besides the possibility of taking the Coenzym in the form of tablets to itself.
“My B12-Werte is correct”, explains it.
Far ways does not have Proctor for the food procurement to go.
Staple food gives it finally everywhere and to each supermarket has meanwhile soy milk and other products.
I find everything that I need, locally.
Only now and then I buy something special.
“Many people surveyed that just only the finished products are expensive, but it in such a way behaves “usual” finished products well-known-measured also”.
Anyway the preparation of veganer courts is by far more favorably and less time-consuming, than generally accepted.
“In the house kitchen it gives to discover much, a few small tricks can one good, if not partly better results obtain”, say Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, somewhat more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its veganen cheesecakes could bring also its parents-in-law to Proctor to being astonished.
The vegan lends a new spice to family celebrations.
That has dynamics, if one cooks together, has that a new value.
“The situations, which can develop thereby, are as differently as humans themselves”, say Proctor.
Naturally was already brought to it in addition, skepticism.
Doesn't my meal taste to you any longer?
“Target I now badly feel, because I drink milk?” - with such questions one must act as vegans with intuitive feeling.
“I do not reject humans, I am part of this society”, would like Proctor no enclave existence to eke out.
And the everyday life world appears more exactly regarded then not at all in such a way veganfremd as assumed - and the vegans not as in the everyday life reduced as generally accepted.
Also nearly Food is permitted.
There are French fries everywhere!
“Many kebab shops offer falafel, or just, Proctor says a vegetarian Yufka”.
In a pizzeria it changes over to pasta courts, or orders just a pizza without cheese, everything a question of the habit.
The restaurants adjust themselves so slowly to it.
“As I began before 13 years to nourish me vegan was still many more difficult all”, can the New Zealander a development make: “One must talk with the people, her on it draws attention”.
“If sufficient demands come, are perhaps bent them to supplement the menu”, hope it.
Vegane restaurants develop, like for example the galley in Mannheim or the café bird-freely.
Proctor preserves the desire that also different restaurants stand at least a veganes court on the menu have.
Strictly speaking are vegane courts for all there.
Everyone can eat it, it is thus exactly the opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes are exclusive against it, in the true sense of the word, because they close others out”, determine Proctor.
“If one food scandals to avoid wants, then veganism is a safe way to make the all-largest part from the beginning impossible”, says Proctor.
The purchase of veganer products can be somewhat difficult however at the beginning.
In particular if one learns to understand, which also into peanuts animal additives contain as color givers its can, one seems with the observance of the ethics with so many hurdles to leave and traps fast the courage.
Therefore Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen did not only write a book: “Veganissimo - the many ingredients, which are buried food in addition, detergents, explain animal ingredients and their alternatives”.
“Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows, to which indications and logos one has to pay attention “it is sometimes better small steps to do than stop or to trip”, white Proctor.
The veganism, it is an important moral pointer, which strikes on consciousness.
Perhaps it creates it not completely that one puts its habits down, but at least can it the consumer teach to analyze its habits critically.

Of Bavaria basketballer despite first defeat optimistically
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism with the basketballers of the FC Bavaria Munich.
“Nobody can forbid us believe also against the best team of Europe of the past two years to win”, balanced Bavaria coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening with titleholder Olympiakos Piräus.

New anti-nicotine vaccine could make for the pleasure when smoking from
Scientists developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which joke at smoking spoil could.
Only one dose of the vaccine could protect mice a life long against nicotine addiction.
Before tests at humans still further attempts are needed, which can take still some years, but professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical college in New York said, the first results were good.
„We are very hopeful the fact that this kind of inoculation strategy can help once millions of smokers, who tried to stop and, had to have tried but experience all methods out available on the market that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches”, so Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was changed in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus infects selectively the liver cells, which produce then a constant river of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them, before they reach the brain, whereby a smoker nicotine High does not experience.
In attempts inoculated mice, to which nicotine was given, maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination against it would have taken, explained one „to time-out” the researchers, an indication for the fact that nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are descriptive in the trade paper Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed, because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be so frequently given for the maintenance of the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractical.
But the costs of the new vaccine are probably clearly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As professor Crystal said, in such a way a future vaccine for humans, if it were completely safe, could be given to children, before they came into temptation to try a cigarette and nicotine addiction to prevent.
More probably however it is that smokers would use it, in order to stop.
„You know then: If they begin again to smoke, feel them because of the nicotine vaccine no more pleasure thereby, and helps them, the habit to put down”, describes it.
British scientists said, the results were interesting, warned however at the same time, is necessary still further research.

Mohammed Mursi puts the oath of office down, but its day of Triumph might not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised „a new Egypt”, when he was sworn in as a first freely selected president of the country and so that the follow-up of Husni Mubarak began, who had been sold 16 months before from the office.
With its inauguration before the highest constitutional court Mursi became also the first freely selected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt a fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy before approximately 60 years.
He put the oath down before the 18 judges of the court dressed into black robes, which has its seat at the Nile and an ancient Egyptian temple is shared.
„We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic”, said Mursi with the solemn ceremony, which became to transfer live in the national television.
„Today the Egyptian people put the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability”, said the 60-year old Mursi, an engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, to a fundamentalist group, trained in the USA, which had been taken since its establishment before 84 years usually as forbidden organization of the respective government sharply in its sights.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Mursi arrived shortly after eleven o'clock local time in a small autoconvoy.
Only a few hundred supporters before the court had met, in order to cheer the new president, and contrary to the presidential splendor from the Mubarak time traffic was only briefly stopped, so that the autoconvoy could cross the usually encouraged road, which connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
When uncharismatisches „spare wheel” the brother shank lampooned its personal prestige since its victory and a Fridays speech increasingly, with which it presented itself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those, who wanted to bring the efforts of the rebellion from the year 2011 against authoritarian Mubarak to the goal.
„Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state”, explained the Mursi the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, dressed into a blue suit with red tie, in which it put the oath of office down.
Later Mursi drove to the university from Cairo, where he should give its inaugural speech.
He was welcomed officially by an army chapel, which played the national anthem, to which he listened in having eight-position.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
With its arrival it of hundreds of present ones in the largest lecture-room of the university with choruses of „the army and the people are welcomed a hand”.
In the year 1908 as bastion of secular education established university of Cairo in the 1970's to a center of Islamist student groups developed.
Mursi put a symbolic oath down at the Tahir place on Friday, the birth place of the rebellion, which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and it praised to back-demand presidential powers which the military advice of out the office hunted the head of state had taken over.
But with the placing of the official oath before the court and before the parliament he bends himself not as usual the will of the military, which points out that the struggle for power will continue.

With 60 years as singers Hubert Wermters's is history with the male choral society Cäcilia nearly twice as for a long time like those of the harsh celebration, within whose framework he was solemnly honoured.
Hubert Wermter stood as used to in the colors of his male choral society on the stage.
Also after 60 years singing with that makes in the meantime probably more than dear won choir still large for it joke.
In the club Wermter was likewise actively, among other things 28 years long as a member of the committee.

Frontier Airlines raises fees for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US Dollar from passengers to who would like to stow hand baggage away on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to compute up to 100 US Dollar for a piece hand baggage and 2 dollar for coffee or lemonade even if in the announcement on Wednesday it were to be read that passengers might keep the whole box.
The new fee is valid for hand baggage in the rack over the seat, small bags under the seat is further free.
Frontier explained, one computes 25 US Dollar, if the fee is in advance paid, and 100 US Dollar with travelers, who paid only at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said to worry the fee of 100 US Dollar aimed off to move travelers before over the payment.
„We would like not to compute this sum”, explained them.
Airlines began 2008 to require for the first and second given up luggage item fees.
Passengers, who tried, to go around these plugged therefore as much as possible in the hand baggage, which has as a consequence that the racks over the seat are frequently overcrowded.
Fees are a possibility of inducing passengers of taking less also on board.
O'Malley said, with the new fee does not go it not really therefore, money earning.
It concerns the most faithful customers from Frontier, which would have expressed clearly that it becomes ever heavier, to find place in the subject over the seat.
Passengers, who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.
That means that perhaps a passenger at the gate of Frontier may carry a luggage item forward free of charge, which must pay next person however to 100 dollar for a comparable luggage item.
O'Malley explained, the website of Frontier and the check in procedures was changed, so that the passengers were informed about the fee, before they would come to the gate.
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier does not come into force only in the summer, an exact date gives it yet.
Passengers grumble frequently about luggage additions and other fees, but airlines fall back gladly to it.
They argue the fact that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service, if they wished it.
Many at Wall Street regard the new luggage fees as indications for the fact that the airlines take enough money, in order to cover after years of the losses the costs from air passage to.
Most leave so far however the fingers of fees for hand baggage.
Spirit airlines Inc. required before three years as first fees for hand baggage and followed later Allegiant air, likewise a low cost airline.
The only other airline with a such fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline advisor Jay Sorensen, which pursues the extra charges attentively.
He estimated in a report from December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit brings in annually 50 million US Dollar.
Sorensen, which held in former times a leading position at Midwest Airlines, flew recently with Spirit and was curious, which would expect him at the gate, if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand baggage fee of the enterprise.
„The Boarding process belonged to the smoothest, which I had experienced, said in my career in aviation” he.
I expected to see tooth crunching and palpable discussions at the gate.
„The airplane was full”, explained it, „and the Boarding ran as lubricated.”
Frontier follows Spirit also with the 2 dollar, which are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The enterprise explained the fact that passengers, the lemonade or juice bought whom might keep whole box and coffee is free of charge refilled.
Water is further free.
US Airways had tried 2008 briefly to require for refreshment beverages money made this however seven months later again retrogressive, after passengers had weighted and no other large society were pulled tight.
Frontiers step to raise fees for the hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly at the airline, is the recent initiative, with which customers are to be steered on the own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US Dollar per sold ticket.
That supplies an incentive to all societies with for inducing passengers to the direct purchase with them instead of over an online travel agency.
Frontier went in this range however furthest.
In September the enterprise began to assign when reservation over an online travel agency only half so many frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday the miles were shortened again on 25 percent of the air route.
An air passage with Frontier over 1000 miles, booked with a third provider, brings in therefore only 250 miles for customers.
Passengers can reserve also exclusively with the direct purchase on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a faithful customer master at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the enterprise loses money.
Proceeds decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank scarcely 13 percent in the first quarter, as in the financial statement is to be read, that on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., were published.
Republic tried to get in the context of sale of the society finances of Frontier into the grasp.

John Kerry explained in an unprecedented confession, the US-espionage went „inadequately too far”
John Kerry suggested macerating the repelling attitude of the USA with an unexpected confession regarding her monitor programs, by saying, the espionage in certain cases „inadequately too far went”.
In addition the minister of foreign affairs admitted, it would carry together with Barack Obama the responsibility for the fact that one had switched to „autopilot”, when the explosive exposures of the Whistleblowers Edward Snowden became public over the espionage activities of the NSA.
By the oozed information the US Government is guessed/advised into a diplomatic storm of indignation of sides of their allied ones.
With a speech to the open Government conference in London, transferred by video connection, said Kerry: „Whole without question have the president and I as well as different one in the government of some things experienced, which ran off quasi by autopilot, simply because the ability in addition existed, which naturally decreases still to the Second World War and the difficult years of the cold war as well as to 11 September.”
Subsequently, it confessed as a first high-ranking member of the US-American government that the US-espionage had exceeded a border, in addition, stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: „In some cases that could be done inadequately too far.”
The president is decided to create clarity and accomplishes therefore a thorough investigation, so that nobody must have the feeling, here takes place abuse.
I insure you that the rights of innocent people during this process are not impaired.
Kerry insisted however on the fact that those was NSA a strength of the good one and had been saved by their monitoring procedures many lives.
It added: „We have to do it with a new world, in which humans are ready, into air to blow up itself.”
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is obsessed on it, to kill humans to air to blow up and governments attack.
What would thus be, if one were able to intercept and stop, before it happens?
We actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of humans, because we experienced before of such plans.
Meanwhile US-American legislator to Europe will travel, in order to scatter the doubts against the alleged American espionage and to convince the Europeans from the necessity to co-operate with the anti-terror efforts further with the USA how the chairman of the senate sub-committee for European affairs explained on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said, it had spoken and was anxious this week with representatives of the European parliament and other people because of their threats not to take part due to frustration over the monitoring by national the Security Agency any longer in anti-terrorist organizations.
„It is very important for the national security interests of the USA the fact that the Europeans remain regarding our common efforts against the terrorism also on board”, explained Murphy, who sits for the first time as a democrat in the senate and as a chairman of the senate sub-committee for foreign relations and European affairs is active in an interview in Washington.
In addition I go to Europe, in order to make clear there that we must co-operate in the fight against terror further, regardless of its annoyance over the NSA programs.
Media reports, according to which those seized NSA millions of telephone data in Europe, have the relations to unite US-allying loaded, although the director/conductor of the secret service explained this week, the reports are unfounded and were based on a misunderstanding of the meta data, which were collected by NATO allying and exchanged with the United States.
Other exposures quoted out from Snowden passed on documents, according to which those had world-wide supervised NSA the mobile phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 further heads of state.
The director/conductor of the national intelligences, James Clapper, defended the espionage with allied one as necessary and explained, this was usual on both sides.
In all tumult Murphy, its authority the ready travel of the congress said forwards, which was to take place this year, and, the delegation hoped members from both parties and chambers will cover.
The names of the other participating delegates are to be published in the coming days.
He said, exact travel route is still prepared.
While Murphy stressed, the purpose of the travel was the improvement of the relations, spoke it also of the fact that it would give some „serious words”.
He said, the European governments would have to be opposite honest their population over the kind of espionage programs, which used them for years.
„We can change our monitor programs and protect so the rights of the Europeans better, these must in addition, to the fact resign itself that we are not the only one, which spy”, so Murphy.
Meanwhile on the weekend a travel lines up into the Near East and to Poland, in order to argue there with resentment over the US-American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US-American monitoring activities for John Kerry.

These questions arise the straight responsible persons of the European space agency Esa.
For their program “Cosmic vision” look for it ideas for two large space projects, which are to make progress with the research crucially.
The budget for such “L-missions” is approximately in each case with a billion euro.
The start will be presumably 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of Septembers met into of Paris the elite of the European space research, in order to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas stood to the debate, five of it now into the closer choice came.
Numerous committees examine the proposals, probe with the researchers.
In the next days a final decision is to fall by the scientific program committee.
Altogether the Esa selected four large questions, on which the missions the 2007 initiated program “Cosmic vision” answers to find are.
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives?
The exact procedures with the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and concomitantly the emergence of planets, which circle these stars - lie still in proverbial darkening.
A large infrared telescope in the universe could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star possesses planets, under which life can develop for circumstances there?
In order to follow to this question, 2017 are to start the space telescope “Cheops”, with which 500 already well-known planetary systems in our closer environment are examined more exactly.
The possibilities are however limited, Cheops are a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments the astronomers could illustrate earthsimilar planets and analyze and for “bio markers” look for even the composition of their atmospheres in such a way: Gases, which are considered as indication for biological activity.
How does the solar system function?
Also this question is to give final information on it, there are which conditions for the emergence of lives.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the reciprocal effect of its magnetic field as well as particle radiation with the planetary system, outgoing from it.
In our solar system these procedures can be examined exemplary.
With “solarly the orbiter” the Esa already granted a mission of the M-class (the budget is there with approximately to a half billion euro) for this question.
The probe is to start 2017 and to observe surface and activity of the sun exactly.
Are of great interest to the researchers also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out, which role the giant planet played with the development of the solar system.
But the Esa plans first that altogether the three L-missions of the “Cosmic vision” - program.
The probe “Juice” (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) presumably begins its travel 2022.
Later it reaches and is eight years Jupiter the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Callisto and Ganymed to examine.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities of studying and of examining subject under extreme conditions in such a way whether us admitted of laws of nature are there still valid.
Perhaps are also deviations, which could point the way to a new theory to the physicists, under whose roof all well-known laws of nature be united can.
How did the universe develop and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos resulted from the Big Bang.
Beside the common subject, of which stars, planets and organisms as we consist, there are us dark matter, whose gravity galaxies and galaxy cluster holds together, and dark energy, by whose working the expansion of the universe accelerates itself.
So far the researchers know neither, who physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor from which dark matter and exists dark energy.
With “Euclid” the Esa also here already granted a M-mission, whose start is intended for 2020.
With a special telescope the probe is to examine the distribution of the subject in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and to make in such a way conclusions possible on the condition of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make a running
Of the 30 proposals in the end the selective procedure only two will remain remaining.
“E-Lisa” has the best opportunities on a grant as L-mission, a demanding concept to the proof of gravitation waves according to opinion of many experts.
Among them physicists understand changes in the structure of the space-time, which had forecast Albert Einstein before nearly 100 years.
They were not proven until today.
Elisa could create that, hopes the scientists behind the project.
The mission plans a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in the universe.
It could prove gravitation waves, which developed with the Big Bang contrary to plants on earth also, and so new realizations over the emergence of the cosmos to supply.
Four further proposals still compete around the second L-mission: a large Roentgen telescope named “Athena”, which is to investigate among other things black holes, “Icy Planets”, a further mission to the outside planets of the solar system, “Prism”, a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the “exoplanet Finder”, which is to seek out and examine earthsimilar planets.
Among other things proposals to the sample return motion of Mars, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as to sun physics were already ruled out.

CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday those of center published for Disease control and Prevention (CDC) a set of guidelines for handling food allergies of children at schools.
These are the first such guidelines, which the US-American government published, since the number of schoolable children with food allergies rises.
One of 20 children in the United States has in the meantime a food allergy.
The spreading of food allergies among children increased 1997 and 2007 according to CDC between by 18 percent.
The guidelines contain information for schools, which is to be supposed to wake a consciousness for food allergies with faculty and the employees and as with children be gone around, who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin available – the autoinjection of the brand EpiPen is most frequently used –, in order to be able to meet a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the Federal States changed recently the regulations, so that schools Epinephrin can keep more simply available.
In the report also a list is contained of typical symptoms, which are called by children, who exhibit an allergic reaction.
Perhaps children say: „It feels, as if something presses my tongue on my tongue”, „feels, as if a hair lies on it” or „my tongue tingles”.

Fire-brigade for the rescue of a little dog called, which stuck 15 meters over the ground on a dangerous rock spur in a quarry
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her awkward situation
Firefighters roped themselves at cliff and saved the dog from certain death
It succeeded to the fire-brigade to bring a little dog in security which stuck on a 15-meter-high lead in a cliff.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby after a traffic accident in the Sunday afternoon and survived three days had run away alone, before them were saved on Wednesday from a quarry.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, those the dog belonged, came to the quarry Flappit into Denholme, west Yorkshire, in order to take Ruby again in receipt and thank you the firefighters of the west Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service.
They had looked desperately for their missed dog and cries for help in social networks had published, when them had run away after the small traffic accident into the quarry.
Approximately against 14:15 clock on Wednesday saw a walker, who implemented its dog, the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter-high paragraph in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire station rushed to the place and roped themselves for rescue Rubys, which was then transported upward in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, Spezialist of the technical rescue team, said: „You was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the center of the cliff – 15 meters from above and for the ground removes.
It did not move a muscle during its rescue – she had rigid-frozen as.
But is now she well.
It ate afterwards a few dog biscuit.
That was a rather unusual employment.
The fact that the dog was discovered, is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, Spezialist of the technical rescue team, said: „Ruby had a giant luck.”
There was the possibility that she was very heavily injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinary surgeon to the investigation, which however except exhaustion and dehydrogenation nothing determined.
Becky Hall from Halifax, west Yorkshire, said: „With the rescue to watch was frightening.”
I could not believe at all that she really up there was.
It was wonderful to hold it again in the arms.
The veterinary surgeon explained, if the exhaustion had become too large and had broken down it, it would have probably fallen.
The firefighters carried great out.
It was really courageous, which they did.
We are simply so grateful and to everyone of them were absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: „We had fear that them would fall down, but she remained above.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe, where she was.

US-border: “Supertunnel” to drug smuggling discovers
At the border between Mexico and the USA investigators discovered a “supertunnel” to drug smuggling and shut down.
As the US-customs authorities communicated, more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway lines and a ventilating system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tons marijuana as well as nearly 150 kilograms cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had not been taken reports the according to yet used.
“These trusts are stupidly, if they mean, them could under the radar away dig through itself”, said the prosecutor general of the US-district Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference before a depot in San Diego, where an end of the tunnel had been discovered.
To the drug gangs eloquently Duffy insured: “If your far such tunnels builds and tries to use she are we decided, an enormous wasting of your dirty money to make”.
Both the US-authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous fight against the drug trusts.
Since 2006 in Mexico more than 77. 000 humans were killed in connection with the drug-related crime.
From experts designs
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel the investigators assume it was designed by architects and engineers and that the building took one year up approximately.
The railway track was in such a way equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On Mexican side the entrance is in a building, which is distant from the border 80 meters.
According to authorities leads a ladder 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
It would have been also suitable in order to promote the illegal immigration direction the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
Third, a Mexican, was seized because of the seized marijuana.
Lifelong freedom withdrawal threatens all three as maximum penalty, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels were discovered, continued to be called it to the press conference in San Diego.
It is however the first time that in such a tunnel construction cocaine was found.
Normally cocaine in small amounts is smuggled and not by tunnels.
This shows the “despair” of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are cut off in the meantime, said Bill Sherman of the drug squad DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything, in order to arrive into the USA.
To the arresting no details were announced, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
They must count on detentions up to ten years.

Obama's backdown in the public health policy
After violent criticism president Obama made a backdown yesterday with his frequently repeated, clear promise: „If your health insurance pleases you, then you can keep it.”
After hundred thousands of their insurer received a written notice of withdrawal, the republicans accused to the president in the last days, it the American public deceived.
Yesterday Obama related his original promise.
„They can keep the vast majority of the citizens, who have a functioning health insurance,”, said it with a speech in Boston.
When reaction to the numerous media reports demanded Obama those Americans, who received such reports to the notices, up, to look around on the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could receiving so a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favorably than prognosticated.
„You come a better offer”, said it.
The government called it few surprisingly that the five percent of the population, which concluded even an insurance for another tariff it would have to look around, since its contract does not correspond to the new standards after the Affordable Care act.
„I would like to say to these Americans completely directly: They earned better”, said Sebelius with a hearing before the energy and commercial committee of the house of representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, which is responsible for the conversion of the Affordable Care Acts, explained that the start of the online platform had run for October „miserably”.
„I am just as frustrated and furiously as all different also”, said her.
I am decided to recover your confidence.
This utterance of an applied Sebelius to one behind its sitting advisor with the hearing of yesterday in the house of representatives was taken up after a dispute with the republican delegate Billy Long from Missouri. Thereby it concerned whether it should be obligated to the participation in Obamacare.
After more than three hours hearing pressed Long Sebelius repeats with the question, why „the architect” of the Affordable Care Acts did not do voluntarily without a by the state promoted insurance, in order to lock a tariff with HealthCare.gov, which it wants to sell now to millions of Americans.

Parents of inter+sexual children can select „sex indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex for children is appreciative, who were born with not clear genital organs.
Newborn children one does not assign any longer rigidly male or womanlike.
After the new law parents must no more sex for such children explain, but can „indefinitely” or „fixed” on the birth certificate indicate.
A goal of the law is it to take the pressure from parents to so that they do not have to make decisions over-hurried regarding operations for a sex assignment with newborn children to fight and discrimination from inter+sexual humans to.
A inter+sexual person said years according to BBC later: „I am neither man nor woman.”
I remain the patchwork, which became to create from physicians, mutilated and full scars.
Roughly one of 2.000 children comes each year neither as a boy nor as a girl to the world.
They belong to the inter+sexual, to a group, which fall under the diagnosis „sexual differentiation disturbance” (DSD), a comprehensive term for humans with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genital organs.
Wallis Simpson was possibly inter+sexual.
The understanding of the sex identification is not yet very fully-fledged, but guesses most experts in the USA to it, one is the best available information for sex assignment to use, if a regulation is not possible, and for psychological and physical child development not to wait, before one decides – if at all – for an operation.
The New Yorker psychiatrists said Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the problem of the sex identification, the new German law „sounded after a good thing”.
Inter+sexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
„Some humans have life-threatening illnesses, which make a surgical interference necessary, but for most children that is valid not”, said it.
One can make and then await a sex assignment without operation, as the identity develops.
The scientific data over it, how a child develops at all his sexual identity, are not very exact.
Nobody knows, why it happens.
It is like the secret, why humans are homosexual.
In a report to the European commission from the year 2011 it, inter+sexual humans means are to be differentiated from transsexual or transgenic the people to, because its status is not sex-referred, but causes by its biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or clearly as one of it does not define.
These characteristics showed up in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair coat, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital organs or in chromosome structures and hormones.
As well as the report gives also an overview of discrimination, to the inter+sexual and transgenic the people in the active life suspended sees itself over the extent of annoyance, force and prejudice crime.
With the sex picture agreeing boy does not have now a special Camp.
In the meantime it in Australia and Nepal for adults are possible to indicate on official documents male, womanlike or „third sex”.
In June Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as world-wide first „a genderless” person, after a court the lifelong retention one had been entitled „to fixed” sex status.
German documents of identification have a third assignment, X for inter+sexual, so the ministry of the Interior apart from M and W in the future.
In the neighbouring France sex topics are still controversial, so a message on France 24.
2011 signed dozens French delegates of the strictly catholic country a petition that „the sex theory was to be removed” from school books.
The US-American website Catholic of online likewise expressed itself against the German law, with the reason: „If the world into a new condition is however not pulled, where the sex represents a decision, sexual activity, then we rotate two further columns of the civilization.”
The mother of a newborn child from Maryland explained zone, her opposite baby it would find better, if babies with the birth a sex is assigned.
„The parents existence is even without further restrictions already stressfully enough, particularly if one does not know, said the sex of the own child” her the parents website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically were seen to children, who were born both with male and female sex parts, when Hermaphroditen designates, after the attractive Greek God, which had both sexes.
Still before ten years the medicine regarded the sex as something, which one could extinguish and then again develop.
But in the meantime the ethical bases of an operation are doubted, after now it admits is how complex the sexual identity is, and that physicians can lie also wrongly, because they do not know, how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned by them.
„In the middle the 20. Century called one the one, psychiatric emergency `”, said Drescher.
If such a child were born, then one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with not clear genital organs decreases on Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University, which held the opinion, the sex is ductile.
It coined the term „sexual identity” and, social and impacts due to environmental factors argued – as parents a child educate – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and coined in such a way whether a person regards itself as male or womanlike.
But in one under the title „” become case from the year 1966 became controversial its theories admit John/Joan.
It guessed/advised to parents of a boy, whose penis had been separated with a cutting bungled, to castrate the child completely and to remove also its testicles and to then bring up it as girls.
„Money presented this case as successful example of a transformation, which it was however not”, so Dre.
When the boy was about 15, it changed back to the male sex and married a woman.
With 38 however he committed suicide.
Loud Dre there are still physicians, who would practice this model.
But into the 1990er years, with which introduction the Internet, are survivors of these sex operations to the public stepped, which are not happy „with the result”.
So for instance with Jim Bruce, a 36 years old author from Montana, who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genital organs.
The physicians were not clear itself over it, whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and was convinced, it can never „a satisfying life” as a man lead.
Thus its external organ and the testicles were removed shortly after the birth 1976 and it as girls were brought up by surgery.
At the age of 12 it received female hormones.
„I knew that I am not a girl”, explained he opposite ABCNews.com
I was unfortunate, but it was really heavy to place questions.
At the age of 18 it should receive a Vaginalplastik.
But since it was depressive and knew that somewhat it was not correct, required he its medical documents.
Which it found out, was shocking.
I was sterilized with my birth – and none ever said that to me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, by which its body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genital organs.
After it had experienced the truth, he changed his breasts again to the male identity, received testosterone injections and let themselves remove.
By the operation it became infertily.
Today it fights for others in an organization named interface Project for the fact that inter+sexual humans are noticed as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Geschäftsführerin in California of the residents right group of Advocates for Informed Choice, worries herself that the German law „for stamping and stigmatizing encourage” can.
„Many activists are to be met anxiously that the German decision could encourage parents, fast decisions and the child, fixed ` not to assign”, explained them.
We are afraid, favour interventions.
We think, it would be better to assign and then await the male or female sex.
Still we do not know, how the law will affect itself, therefore can we only speculate.
Tamar Mattis said, their organization supports the Australian law, because „it makes the acknowledgment for adults possible as the third sex”.
„Adults should be able to make own decisions over their legal sex”, explained them.
With the German law it goes around the assignment with the birth.
That is not a fight, to which one should force small children at this time.
If they arose, they can decide on their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburg, which has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disturbance and other one supports hundreds in a self-help group, says, the German law „authorizes” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, has however a DSD on behalf of complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the goal cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
It has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie 29 is married and; she works on the University OF Pennsylvania as an employee in the child psychiatry.
It is infertily, hopes however, to be able to get by adoption or a surrogate mother a child.
„The law gives parents to area, whereby it does not rush into decisions meet must”, said Baratz.
It provides the time for them to make and things clarify different tests and gives them time in such a way, before they write womanlike „male” or „”.
In this way everything is correct – one pulls the child largely and loves it.
One has a marvelous baby and enjoys the parents luck.
And one does not have over-hurries an operation to make, which cannot be cancelled any longer.
„Into the decision also and eliminates the fear, which plagues parents, because they the opinion are, includes the children, them the correct would not do”, described it.
Finally the child decides on the sex, which fits better it – and that is marvelous.
Thus children are put into the position to make the decision.

The excellent fight mastered
The role of the Santiago, the old man in Hemingways novella “the old man and the sea”, is cut Horst Janson on the body.
Janson is even an old hare in its profession, dramatic art.
None can fool something to the old man Santiago with fishing.
Thus the two complement each other simply greatly.
One means nearly, the folds in the neck of the old man, of which the Fischer boy Manolo speaks, sees being able.
If Santiago sits tiredly from the life bent on the chair, is genuine with Janson.
Besides the role of the old fisherman is thoroughly a character role, which masters Janson excellent.
Hemingway tell the story of a fighter, a courageous man, who does not give up and finally by its knowledge and also its strength of will the fight against the fish wins.
Janson is in far distances as an however actor on the stage.
It creates it to focus the attention of the audience on itself so that its monologues are not boring a moment.
Its efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the spectators forget that the sea exists nevertheless only out blue lit up water bottles.

Desire on ice cream, which shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first in the dark bright ice – assistance of jellyfishes.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animals and created from it a bright treat.
The idea in addition came it after it had read a research work over jellyfishes and Chinese scientists convince could to manufacture the bright protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the consumption with the tongue, whereby the pH value in the protein is raised and shining is caused.
Chris explained, the ice-cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more one thus licks, the more brightly becomes it.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company „Lick ME I'm Delicious”, says: „The product is unbelievable, but still in a very early production phase, and so one receives two gram of it for 200 pound.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
If the mouth warms up the protein, the pH value rises and the ice shines.
We tested it in the last months and appeared it to us ideally to bring it at Halloween on the market because it has this marvelous shining effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I manufactured ever, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me to about 140 pound.
But but it tastes more delicious.
Charlies experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, to which beer, cheese, beef and gold foil belong.
But its newest creation is to become still more ambitious.
He says: „I would like to develop gladly an invisible ice cream.”
That is impossible to and for itself due to the refraction of light, which is caused by the ice crystals, of which ice cream consists; but I assume, we find a possibility of creating it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent characteristics of a jellyfish, which are artificially manufactured of Chinese scientist

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the ecumenical discussion forum
At the next ecumenical discussion forum on Monday, 21 October, in the new museum of the lock goes it around the topic “to hell with hell - theological considerations to today's handling the last things”.
Adviser is a professor Johanna Rahner.
The ecumenical discussion forum is an initiative of the catholic and protestant parishes Salem, the lock Salem and the Office of Cultural Affairs Bodensee district.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum of the question, how today humans classify the “last things” after death.
If humans would have known in the past centuries of it too much and on those pictures of sky and hell set, “to today our conceptions coin”, then be characterised the contemporary prophetic science of hopes for completion rather by a certain embarrassment or speechlessness.
“Larger hope was driven out Christians and Christians by religious criticism duly”, says the adviser.
It supplied “us with so many question marks that us the exclamation marks seem to have been misplaced”.
Johanna Rahner shares: “The crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death” nevertheless.
With it the question about that longing, “those is connected of the fact dreams that may be good in the end everything”.
Johanna Rahner, 1962 born in Baden-Baden, studied catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwig university Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
It attained a doctorate 1997 to the Dr. theol., likewise in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelm university.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner holds a chair for systematic theology at Institut for catholic theology of the University of Kassel.

Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
“The marriage is the most important expedition, which humans can undertake”, said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Now a special fair in the domain in Hechingen gave hints, as at least the wedding ceremony succeeds.
Represented important providers were round around a wedding.
A trend: The Retro look held again introduction.
That begins for instance with the wedding dresses.
Weis is best covered must, or in cream.
The often gathered and dresses provided with embroideries are in front closed, often with a veil, in the back however often descend them the backs and to end in a Schleppe.
There however the spirit separates, as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house stresses dress Müller.
With gentlemen the suit with waistcoat and Plastron dominates, but also cream-colored or brown combinations can be selected.
The selection of the restaurant is important, was explained.
Plain adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should particularly be.
Here the domain made attentive to their own offer in the Remise.
Who wants to then move forward with the carriage, for that Uwe link has an offer.
“Carriages are in addition, for June assistant partings like”, mean he.
Romance is in demand also for invitations, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more into fashion come the “after Wedding photo” - thus admission series at special places, preferably for instance water falls, some days to the celebration, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many further details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a Zauberer, as for instance Marko Ripperger, who can maintain guests stylishly.
Too the correct cosmetics and nail care do not forget.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.

Google, Samsung, Huawei because of Nortel patents sues
The group, which possesses thousands of earlier Nortel patents, exerted an avalanche of complaints on Thursday because of infringement of a patent against mobile phone manufacturer, among them also Google, the enterprise, which was over-bid during the insolvency auction by Nortel by it.
Rock star, the consortium, which had bought the Nortel patents for 4.5 billion US Dollar, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd., HTC Corp, Huawei and four other enterprises because of infringements of a patent before the US-district court in Texas.
Rock star is in the community possession of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of the infringement of a patent in seven cases.
The patents would concern technology, which brings search terms on the Internet with relevant advertisement in agreement, so the complaint, which meets with it the core of Google search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and rock star were not directly attainable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones, which work with of Google operating system android, which stands in sharp competition to the Mobil products of Apple and Microsoft.
In the year 2011 Google delivered a initial requirement over 900 million dollar for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and offered last 4.4 billion US Dollar.
After it was over-bid with the Nortel patents by rock star, acquired Google Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion US Dollar, a business, which was motivated also partially by of Motorola library at patents.
„Although Google with its attempt failed to acquire the complaint patents with the auction has Google the patents injured and this does also further”, so the complaint letter.
Rock star demands a high payment of damages of Google, since it states, of Google infringement of a patent is intentional, so the accusation.

Frankfurt parking fees are to rise strongly
Parks in Frankfurt could become sensitively more expensive soon.
Municipal authorities of the city this morning Stefan Majer (the Green) advises over a template of traffic departmental head.
Therefore the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However not the prices are to be raised, but the time interval of parking meters and park illusory automats of 30 to 20 minutes be shortened.
In December then still the town council must decide.
The retail trade committee of the IHK Frankfurt holds “for no good idea”.
The parking possibility before the business is directly “an not underestimating advantage for smaller specialist dealers”.
The traffic club Germany is the opinion that an increase is “for a long time overdue” quite appropriately and actually after two decades.
The public suburban traffic becomes also more expensive.

The reference crude oil places for deliveries in December was on the late morning in Europe in the electronic trade at New York Mercantile Exchange around 14 cent on 96,24 USD per barrel please.
The contract fell around 39 cent on Thursday, which meant a price deterioration of 5,8 percent in October.
The large crude oil offer loaded the prices in the past weeks.
The department of energy of the USA explained on Wednesday, the USA requirement last week had increased by 4.1 million barrel.
In the course of five weeks the offer had risen by 25 million barrel.
But on Friday there was referring to stronger demand by two reports over an activity increase in the Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery of the economy of China, whose growth had risen to 7,8 percent in the third quarter, after it had arrived in the previous quarter on the lowest conditions for two decades.
Crude oil of the sort Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, which is used also from US-American refineries, fell to the ICE Exchange in London around 26 cent on 108,58 USD per barrel.

The waste-oriented society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the tendency good, but it goes sometime home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the front seat passenger and rear seat hunger becomes apparent.
Clearly, but or other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible!
What lies there more near to drive as chilled to the next drive in order to grant itself a little thing?
I admit, I participate gladly also, if it goes lateat night and/or early in the morning to the fast food getting.
A few French fries, a cola drink, a Burger - and then nothing like off home and in the bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco Gängern become apparent.
Because which must be missing to one that one throws its fast food bags from the autowindow with constant regularity?!
Above all on weekends thrown away paper bags lie at edges of road and on parking lots.
“Why? ”, I ask myself.
Are the people too stupid, in order to take the bags with home respectively up to the next garbage pail?
It is not only like that that of paper things ruins the landscape.
Bags already covered transportation facilities such as guard rails and released thus accidents.
About something like that meant “waste-oriented society” does not think however, probably white it not even, what actually means this word.
If one in the evening more frequently on the way is, more than ever with several people in the car, one knows, how partied non-stop after back bank nights look can: Gears, bottles and other garbage pile up themselves there.
There few bags would not constitute more or less nevertheless also a nothing - contrary to the road, where none wants to rum-trample on the leftovers of others.
I see the day, on which clearing will have to require the cities and communities to dumb - and the fast food chains for its bags pledge coming.

Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegane nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Puréeed Tofu with plant cream is for example a quark replacement.
Further one calls the vegetarian federation to the Weltvegantag on 1 November.
The vegetarian federation Germany suggests a set of veganen alternatives on the occasion of the Weltvegantags on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt lets by soy yogurt replace.
Instead of milk can be used soy, oats, almond or rice milk.
Impact-cash plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
Also to eggs there are vegetable alternatives.
A half crushed, ripe banana for example can replace an egg as bonding agents in a cake.
Also 50 gram of apple mash or a tablespoon ground flax seeds plus three tablespoons water are suitable for it.
Pastes become loose instead of with egg for example with a mixture from a teaspoonful baking powder, a tablespoon food strength and three tablespoons mineral waters.
In addition, 50 gram soy yogurt or Seidentofu can serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu at present approximately 800,000 humans nourish themselves vegan, thus purely vegetable in Germany.

A black box in the car?
US-American road planner are in the search for financial resources in order to repair the purging highway system, and believe the solution in a small black box to have found which finds in the instrument panel of each car place.
The devices, which note each driven kilometer and which information announces to the authorities, are quintessential point controversies of an attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the Federal States to revise the outdated system for the financing of US-American roads.
The normally rather boring area of the road planning suddenly kindled an intensive debate with multicolored alliances.
Libertarian with environmental groups it allied itself and to suggest itself out that the government the small boxes for noting the driven kilometers – and possibly also, where they were driven – to use and the information then for the calculation of tax assessments to use knows.
The Tea party is frightened.
The American civil right combination (ACLU) is likewise deeply anxious and expresses a set of privacy doubts.
But while one cannot agree in the congress on an action, several Federal States do not wait longer.
They check at present, how they can change in the course of the next ten years to a system, with the driver per driven mile pay.
Thousands of drivers tested the tachographs, by which some are equipped with GPS monitoring, already.
That is real must for our country.
„It is not anything, which we will only possibly use”, said Hasan Ikhrata, Geschäftsführer of the Southern California Assn. OF Governments, which plans a recording of the driven miles with all California drivers in the Federal State starting from 2025.
The way, how we pay these taxes, will change.
There the technology for it is.
The initiative comes to one time, since the highway Trust the Americans at the gasoline pump pay find, which is financed from the taxes, broke is.
But one refuels no longer so much in America like in former times.
Cars use fewer gasolines.
The national oil tax of 18,4 cent per gallon (less than 4 eurocent per litre) did not rise for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare with high petrol prices to raise the tax only around a cent.
„The gasoline tax is simply not sustainably”, like that Lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota.
Its Federal State equipped recently 500 cars with tachographs, with which a mile-based payment system is to be tested.
„The on a long-term basis most meaningful alternative represents”, said it.
Bureaucrats call it mile-based user fee.
It does not surprise that the idea finds with urban liberal resemblance, because the tax would let itself begin for example to affect the handling in such a way that back-up and climaticharmful exhaust gases are reduced.
The California planners set on the system during the elaboration of strategies, with which the ambitious anchored, legally goals of the Federal State to the climate change to be achieved are.
But the republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, likewise explained that he therein see the most passable long-term alternative.
Also free marking out of the Reason Foundation are done of the idea to let pay drivers after put back distance.
„That is not a tax, which disappears to Adrian Moore, Vizepräsident for guidelines in a black hole”, explains with Reason.
The people pay directly for what they get.
The movement is supported also by two former American transport ministers, who had requested the congress in a report in the year 2011 to move toward mile-based account.
The U.S. Senate approved last year 90 million a dollar expensive pilot project, which would have covered 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the house of representatives prevented the raid and reacted with it to the doubts of delegates from rural areas, which represent humans, who must often put many miles back on the way to work or into the city in the everyday life.
Several Federal States and large cities move nevertheless on own fist in this direction.
Oregon, who enlists 5,000 drivers at present for the largest experiment of the country, is most committed.
These drivers will pay soon the mile fees instead of the oil tax to the Federal State.
Nevada already concluded a pilot project.
New York town center considers likewise such.
Illinois tests it in reduced measure with trucks.
And the I-95-Koalition, to which the Ministries of Transport of 17 Federal States at the east coast belong (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examined at present, as one would bring the change in could.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteer was equipped with the devices, drivers were sceptical with the thought, the government could each of their movements pursue.
„Doubts against Big Brother and such things were a large problem”, explain Alauddin Khan, director/conductor of the strategy and result management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada on its website warned: „It would be relatively simple to transform the tachographs into full-grown control instruments.”
There is not a necessity to develop a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure which would be used inevitably for it, data over the daily movements from individuals to seize.
Nevada belonged to a set of Federal States, which hold now after affordable technology look out, with which the state the driven kilometers seize can, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, so Khan, would be also the public more reassuring.
The hunt for this technology led some authorities to a small Startup enterprise named True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not begin, in order to help Federal States with the taxation from drivers to.
Rather it was their goal of seizing in a rising market for car insurances foot with which drivers on basis of the driven miles are to pay.
But devices tested of their are interesting also for the road planners, because they work not with GPS and supply only limited information, which is uploaded regularly by modem.
„The people are rather ready to take part in if their speed and locations are not noted”, explained Ryan Morrison, Geschäftsführer von True Mileage.
In some these public pilot programs large errors were made.
There are substantially cheaper and less intrusive possibilities of converting this.
In Oregon the planners experiment to give to drivers a set from options to.
They can decide for equipment with or without GPS.
Or they select at all no equipment and pay instead a lump sum charge on basis on the average of the miles driven from all inhabitants of the Federal State.
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by equipping the devices with more functions than with few.
In New York traffic officials equipment for taxation to develop, with which also parking fees can be paid, an insurance only for driven kilometers be paid, want to be able to evade to town center must and speed data are raised from other vehicles in real time, owing to those drivers of back-up.
„Drivers were motivated by the increase in value of the advantages, which the system offers, to the participation”, are called it in a planning document of the city.
Some traffic planners ask themselves however whether the whole gossip is over paying per mile not only an enormous diverting manoeuvre.
With the metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials, the congress explained could solve the problem bankrupt highway Trust find simply by increase of the fuel tax.
An additional unique fee or an annual delivery could be imposed upon to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles, which use little gasoline, so that also these paid a fair portion.
„There is no reason for an operation, even if an Aspirin is sufficient, describes” Randy Rentschler, the leader for legislation and public affairs of the commission.
If we do that, hundreds make themselves millions of drivers ensure over its privacy and numerous other things.

Bath dry home: A dream becomes true for the FC
At the meaning for the city and the football club the official inauguration celebration for the artificial turf sports field did not lose anything despite the cold weather and the rain.
On past Saturday all had probably desired a more pleasant ceremony, but Petrus did not want to play thereby.
So all those had a checking, which came without umbrella or could not for such one from possibly a reason not hold.
That could be done to the musicians, who framed the ceremony, exactly the same as so some speaker.
Therefore also the FC-chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, became wet.
Its thanks were valid for all in front mayors Walter Klumpp, who had strongly engaged himself for the conversion of the project, the local council, the enterprises involved and club members, who brought in themselves.
Here completely particularly Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioners moved 400 square meters of paving-stones for the new ways.
This remarkable honorary commitment appreciated also the state parliament delegate Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the urban sport committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the football federation, Kuno Kayan southof Baden, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, which announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp brought in memory that always recurring weather-related influences added to the original lawn in such a way in the spring and autumn that he could not be taped.
Already before 15 years there were the first considerations for the solution of the problem, when the building of a third place with the area of the football club or at the six-form high school at the saltworks lake one thought.
Both was again rejected.
Before six years thoughts on the application of an artificial turf sports field arose, which was generally viewed as the ultimative solution.
Concrete planning was taken up before two years, when the FC transferred the Schabelstube to hereditary lease, assured a cost sharing of 100,000 euros for the building of the place and conveyance of 104,000 euros approved of the country.
The local council decided the assumption of the remaining 356,000 euros at the total costs of 560,000 euros in October 2012, summarized Klumpp.
The commencement of construction of the 68 times 108 meters large artificial turf place took place on 4 June.
During over three months the persisting construction phase 3000 cubic meters of earth were cleared away, about which half for the application of a Dirt Bike distance was used.

Snowden ready, with Germany regarding US-monitoring too „cooperate”
Edward Snowden, who Whistleblower of the US-American secret service, has explained, it is ready to travel to Berlin and state before the German Bundestag, if the American national Security does not give answers Agency and her director Keith Alexander over their activities.
The German delegate Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where these asylums received, in order to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter of Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, this writes: „Even if the result of my efforts were as can be prove positive, treats my government a deviating opinion further as loyalty break and tried to criminalize political expression of opinion with penalty clause with defense is not possible.”
The truth to say is however no crime.
In the letter Snowden, he writes is convinced of the fact that the support of the international community can convince the American government to let the accusation fall against him.
The accusation raised from the US Department of Justice covers espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said in relation to time of online: „If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives then we find ways to make possible.”
The relations between the USA and Germany is burdening, the NSA heard that to mobile phone of chancellor Angela Merkel by the statements.
Thomas Oppermann, who explained delegate, who the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service leads, one is to take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible, „without him to endanger and the relations with the USA completely to ruin”.
Ströbele, a delegate of the Greens, published a picture of itself and Snowden in its Twitter feed.
It was accompanied with its visit in Russia by two German journalists.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia, if he leave the country.
If Snowden in Germany states, then need it a warranty that he is safe there „”, so the delegate.
Snowden explains in its letter that he would see himself to one „serious and sequential” pursuit campaign suspended, which had driven him out from its homeland.
It is however affected from the world-wide reaction to „means act of the political expression of opinion”.
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – also in the United States – called the exposures over an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring a earnings at the public.
In its letter Snowden makes an offer of co-operation for the German authorities, „if the difficulties around the humanitarian situation was approximately solved”.

Security doubts in Mozambique grow in view of collisions between influential figures
Thousands of humans met in the center Maputos under the watchful eyes of the Statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president Mosambiks, in order to intone with a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
„We want again peace, we want stability”, said Vanessa de Sousa, Geschäftsführerin of an investment enterprise.
From fear around the future of the country it exchanged its business clothes against a T-shirt with the label „we to demand security” on Portuguese and on Thursday of the quantity at the independence place of the capital followed.
For two weeks there is almost daily report over collisions between government forces and Renamo, which rank among the worst engagements since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, by Rhodesia governed by white ones and later the Apartheitsregierung South Africa was initially supported in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the peace treaty from 1992 it became an opposition party.
Analysts hold it for improbable that the country drops back again into an full-grown conflict, but the recent events foreign investors and native ones worried.
For the fast growing economy stands much on the play, because the discovery of enormous gas reserves before the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring in the next years investments from over 50 billion US Dollar of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the country.
The governing Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominating strength, and Renamo give themselves mutually the debt for the tensions.
Renamo states, which government has the recent collisions provoked, by having attacked its members in the province Sofala, a traditional center Renamos on 17 October.
The encroachments on the former rebels escalated, than government troops attacked and tried Renamo bases to kill Afonso Dhlakama the leader of the group, explained Renamos spokesman opposite Financial Times.
The government gives the debt for the collisions to Renamo and accuses the organization of soldiers to have attacked.
President Armando Guebuza tried to play doubts down over an instability.
Opposite AFP, he said French press agency to which on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards itself as „a loser”, who wants to use „all its still remaining forces, in order to prove that it can force upon its decisions to the government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they would like to avoid a war.
But the doubts have increased, since Mazanga with the words was quoted, Renamo give up the peace agreement of 1992.
Opposite the FT explained he, thus he had meant that Frelimo does not respect the agreement any longer.
„Our vision is it to take up again negotiations seriously”, said Mazanga.
Earlier discussions between the parties contributed only few to the settlement of the tensions, which were beaconed by a set of collisions in this year.
„We have here two adults of men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who collide, mean the heads” Joseph Hanlon, Dozent at the open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is well in negotiating and none is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which pushes on choice elections, explained, it the local elections in November will already boycott.
Presidency and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the employment of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial privileges from the government to.
Renamos of electoral successes shrink since 1992, while a newer party, those from a former Renamo member created Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM) will probably improve, with the elections.
Mazanga states that Guebuza – whose resignation lines up, if its second term of office ends in the next year – which democracy of the country wants to destroy.
„It does not want multi-party democracy, it wants no transparent elections, it wants no peace, because he does not want to give the presidential office”, so to Mazanga up.
It is unclear, which Renamo has capacities, but she undertook unrest pin end of attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north south connections.
Most engagements took place in the province Sofala, which lies some hundred kilometers north of Maputo, in which however Beira is, the port, which mining industry companies use such as Rio Tinto and Vale to the export of coal.
In June Rio interrupted one month long the use of the railway, after Renamo had announced an attack on the distance.
Mazanga answered reservedly to the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn „the international community that the things are located to Mazanga in Mozambique not well”, said.
The instability increased frustration over the government still, says Fernando Lima, Leiter von Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many humans worried themselves already because of the corruption, the sluggish progress with the development and a recent kidnapping wave.
„Humans think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and it should be that, which finds, explains solutions for the problems” it.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said, humans wanted simply only to stability.
„Renamo and Frelimo, them do not interest want simply only again peace and usable roads”, explained it.

Chinese newspaper is to become reformed after call „”
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded on the title page the release of a reporter, who had been accused of defaming, is reformed, explained a press modulator.
In Guangzhou resident new express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen admitted later on TV that he had accepted bribes, in order to falsify reports over a part-national company.
Now the new express of one „of comprehensive rectification” one submit, explained the regulatory authority.
„The rectification arrangement” was issued from the authority for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Provisional investigations showed that the new express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening news Group had published several unfounded reports between September 2012 and August 2013 over the quoted enterprise Zoomlion.
„The editorship management of the new express was unordered”, announced the regulatory authority in an explanation.
She said, one had decided to impose and from him its reporter license withdraw „an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou”.
In addition one instructed „the Yangcheng Evening news Group to make a complete rectification of the new express and recommended to determine the relevant responsible persons with the new express and to examine the guidance team of the new express immediately.”
Chen had written several articles for the new express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After he had been arrested, the newspaper of two calls for its release on the title page published and placed themselves behind its journalistic work.
But then Chen in public television arose and admitted that he had published wrong reports against payment.
„In this case I have Zoomlion damaged just like the entire news industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public”, explained he opposite the national news station CCTV.
I did it primarily, because I was on money and fame out.
Me it became clear that I acted wrongly.
Following Chens apology published the new express an apology on the title page and explained, one had missed it to examine the reports correctly.
Different well-known suspects put confessions down in recent time on TV.
Experts say that confessions are forced still by routine, despite a law change at the beginning of the year, in which was forbidden to the authorities forcing someone to accuse itself of.

NSA explained, „an internal error” and not hackers are debt at the crash of the website
The shadeful national Security Agency explained on late Friday, an error their public website had paralyzed and not some hours hackers, as was online stated.
„NSA.gov was tonight some hours long not attainable, there during a planned update an internal error arose”, described the spy agency in one by email dispatched message.
The problem is repaired in this evening.
The statement, the loss is by one distributes implemented Denial OF service attack (DDoS) caused, is not true.
In the early evening hours online server Trackern had been noticeable that the NSA website was at least six hours long not attainable and this for some users is also further not.

Secret information is not in danger, so the spokesman.
At least one group of Hacktivisten took up for itself the NSA website with an DDoS attack to have paralyzed.
With such attacks the goal website with side calls is flooded, until the servers are overloaded and the website breaks down.
The Cybertaktik is relatively simple and the attacks serves not to penetrate into the internal network of the system of objectives.

It added, with authors and teachers, who were excessively didactical „”, children „completely would switch off”, because in entertaining stories the messages were obtained „subliminally”.
Crossley Holland, which translated Beowulf from the anglo-saxon one and author of the Penguin Book OF Norse Myths and that are British Folk of valley, explained: „One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep her if possible in the background.”
Perhaps that big difference between an adult is appropriate for author, who write for adults, and an author, who write for children, in the necessity to obtain hope.
Everything must be simplified or led to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense for good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, reveal by those history and not explained.
That is old history of showing instead of telling.

Report: Obama campaign considered to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors of president Barack Obama considered on the sly to replace vice-president Joe Biden in the election campaign 2012 by Hillary Clinton so New York Times.
The exposure is the noteworthy Estonian surprise of the long expected work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann over the election campaign 2012, „doubles down: Game CHANGE 2012”.
The Times is present a copy of the shortly appearing book and it reported on Thursday evening that the Topberater of the president would have accomplished „extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011”, in order to find out whether it looks better for Obama's shrinking hope for re-election, if it fall let Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, nationalpolitical correspondent of the Times, retraces the book thoroughly the history of the efforts of prominent employees of the campaign and the white house, namely the earlier White House Chief OF Staff Bill Daley to measure it has which effect on the poll ratings to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton for the vice-president.
The potential changes was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the oval Office.
Only a half dozen of the closest advisors of the president – including Daley, the former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former leading white house counsels, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about started thinking the change answer.
In „doubles down” it is maintained, Daley at the point of the efforts, Biden confessed despite their „to close to exchange personal relationship” before one finally decided against such a chess move, after the data showed that Clintons do not improve the candidacy „the opportunities of Obama considerably” became.
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden by Clinton.
„I expressed a whole set of things, which one should consider, and which was one of it”, explained Daley the magazine.
One must call oneself in memory that the president had at that time terrible poll ratings, therefore thought we: „Over God will, which we make?”
While Daley called the investigations „due care”, Martin said opposite Anderson Cooper one of CNN that during the campaign for the re-election substantial expenditure had been operated, in order to find out whether such a course pays off regarding the ballot boxes.
„In campaigns so much money is not spent on surveys and focus groups, if one does not think seriously about somewhat”, explained Martin on AC360.
It is not clear however whether Obama knew that its team thought about an exchange.
Martin said opposite CNN, it had asked Daley whether its boss at that time would have known about the potential change.
Although Daley explained, he did not believe that the president of the possible change was conscious „”, admitted the former chief of staff, it is „” been possible that Obama of it had known.
Martin added that „double does not supply down” a definite answer to the question, whether the political soundings of Obama would have reached desk.
Cooper did not ask Martin, whether he seriously think, Obama anything from the investigations knew whether one was to let Biden fall with the elections.
„Possible”, answered Martin.

Local council is pleased about solid household
Every time it concerns into session of the district councils the household, mayor Ralph Gerster has well to laugh.
The Gemeindesäckl in stove cheek beautiful oh is filled well and debts knows the administration already since 2005 no more.
Also the financial year 2012 can be booked in this sense as full success.
This became clear with the conception of the annual account for 2012.
How Andrea Rothmund described, the operating budget with approximately 7.6 million euros over millions a euro had more highly failed than planned.
Also the surplus of the operating budget lies with approximately 1.8 million euro approximately millions euros over the approach.
To owe the surplus is above all higher business tax revenues and the community portion of the income tax.
Also the fortune budget lay again clearly over the planned values.
Instead of the intended 1.5 million euros it amounted to last year 2.5 million euros.
“This is essentially because of the higher supply from the operating budget”, thus to Rothmund.
Since in the financial year 2012 fewer investments than were planned transacted, also the reserves supply failed more highly.
Altogether the general reserve could be increased by approximately 2.1 million euros on now altogether 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked you Rothmund and their team for the good work.
“One vibrates, praised such a work not simply from the sleeve” Gerster with view of the annual account.
It and the local councils were pleased obviously about the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxically, but exactly these good numbers could stand the citizens soon expensively to come.
By the good financial situation the community could do in the past without high rates of assessment.
Thus again however according to Gerster already repeatedly subsidies were shortened by the country.
For these subsidies from various balance sticks there are conditions.
Among other things the cities and communities, which request subsidies, must show certain rates of assessment.
“The topic of rates of assessment we must look at, since in the coming years investments line up, for which we gladly subsidies would have”, announced ourselves Gerster in this context.

Despair cry of an Obama voter
I have president Obama twice selected in hope on the fact that change is possible
He says, Obama undertook praise-worth efforts, which were defeated by the blockade tactics of the republicans
The blockade politics does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs over the election campaign 2008 are a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year to the Harvard Medical School.
I read at present a terribly sad book.
It is a book, from which I believed, it me during the doleful second year of my medical studies would cheer up and to me again hope would give.
It is called „The Audacity ton Win” to win (courage) and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas to the presidential election 2008.
If I am finished with my patient minute in the evening and go to bed, then the book leads me back into a time, when the policy millions inspired could rob and from talking the breath.
The choice became a landslide victory and a newscaster stopped, in order to lead the historical meaning of this hour before eyes.
My school fellows cried before joy and my parents collected all newspapers, which could find them.
A young team from visionaries was on the way in the white house and the nation was ready for change.
When 2008 Obama changed at that time in the office, he had agreement values of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Again to switch to the present is bad awaking, as if one is torn from a dream.
It falls heavily to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder to missed possibilities.
In the years, since I delivered my voting for the first time, actually somewhat changed.
But it is simply nothing that I could myself have presented.
I recognize the great and versatile things on, which Obama reached, of concealing of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden, forced by the adoption of the Affordable Care act for health insurance up to the military departure from Iraq, the end.
Also I am the opinion that party-political blockade tactics tilted too many efforts, with which our nation forward be brought should: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, in order to call only some.
But after I defended countless marks the Obama government opposite colleagues and acquaintance, I arrived with my attempts at explanation in the end.
I reached one point of political despair.
The republican blockade politics cannot explain, why one permits a hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain, why those collects national Security Agency data over the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower are punished, which reveal national failure.
It cannot explain, why Anwar al-Awlaki, an US-American citizen, was murdered without procedures, still why the public financing and edition borders during the presidential elections is gone around.
It does not justify the results of a report, in which it means, the efforts of the white house toward the immobilization of the media is „aggressivsten… since the nixon administration”.
And jüngstens it cannot excuse the inability to sketch in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care act a simple website.
I do not know whether it is that, which I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that the government work could contradict her preceding political campaigns.
The office for delegate a foreseeable course is not obvious, since an opposition party and fortuitous events coin like the Newtown massacre the public discussion.
But if I view myself the examples specified above, then they seem to a large extent from the government selected to be.
And disturbs me at most.
I selected 2012 again Obama, not because I was enthusiastic over its candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and ill-considered alternative, he seemed his direction and positions not to specify not to be able.
I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, freely from the pressure of future elections, the hope would fulfill, of which we had for such a long time heard.
But with the sinking of the agreement values for Obama on under 45% this week the return became all the harder in the year 2008 by this book.
It wakes the longing in me after the many promises, which dissolved in air.
This week read I a section in the book, which describes, how Obama had to put a heavy loss against Clinton with the primaries into Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election helpers after the decision he said to its employees, her would have to come back after course and follow the purpose of their thing.
„I would like that we regain, said our charm” it.
We must remember, who we are.
There is five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree you more strongly.
In this comment expressed opinions are excluding from Nathaniel Morris.

In Pfullendorf the river becomes more expensive
The citizens Pfullendorfs must adjust themselves to higher cost of electricity.
Like the managing director of public utilities, Jörg-Arne Bias, opposite whom SOUTH COURIER confirmed, to a four-member Pfullendorfer 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year come to family.
Substantial reason of the lining up price increase is the rise of the so-called EEG allocation of 5,277 to 6,3 cent per kilowatt-hour.
This allocation is again determined each year in October by the four operators that of the large electricity lines.
These number them from the energy turn developing extra costs, which can raise them by an allocation over the electricity tariff.
Public utilities Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had proceeded in its prognoses even from a higher allocation, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now would have the concrete pay to be calculated, before public utilities could inform next week their customers about the accurate price increase.
“We go to bias from a rise of 1 cent plus x out”, thus, whereby the number will lie rather in the proximity of the 2 cent.

The opportunities on the league whereabouts of the Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketballers sportily descended rose.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then it gives a competitor to giants for the Neckar now less.
