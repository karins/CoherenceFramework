Schools are encouraged to greater focus on math, spelling, and grammar
In English literature courses, students must handle in the future at least a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
In the test, "Unseen texts" find entrance to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
By 2015, students must drop a separate GCSE exam for language where there are strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics - the first fan who have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative is Ofqual, which disclose supervisory authority for testing, a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there was a "Broad consensus indicates that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence", where he stressed the GCSEs would be "challenging, ambitious and strict".
Studies show that in English schools, less time for mathematics applied 116 hours per year or three hours a week per year - as in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours annually and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal request to provide more time for mathematics in the curriculum, but it means the comprehensive math test - combined with a stronger weighting of the compartment in rankings from coalition circles - schools probably will encourage to use more hours.
In the curriculum more attention on "Issues of real life", including financial mathematics.

I saw as a result of the publication of this concerns me I a serious and sustained smear campaign exposed that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which allows me to the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response on my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States--have the revelations to a system of all-encompassing surveillance that accountability is no one guilty, judged as a service to the public.
This espionage revelations drew many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the formerly hidden abuse of the public trust.
The benefits to society from this acquired knowledge becomes increasingly clearer; at the same time, the risks in buying were visibly reduced.
Although demonstrably positive was the result of my efforts, my Government remains treated dissent as a betrayal and seeks to criminalize political speech and under indictment.
Still, to speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States with the support of the international community will take this prejudicial attitude.
I hope that I, if the difficulties of the humanitarian situation are settled, his will able, in the responsible clarification of the facts with regard to the statements made in the media, in particular in regard to truth and authenticity of reports, to participate appropriately and in accordance with law.
I look forward to talking to you in your country, once the situation is clarified, and thank you for their efforts to uphold international law, that protects us all.

Traveling through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors only one for 5,000 people,
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 vote to him to the ' CNN hero of the year "to choose.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw with, how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and went to hospitals, which did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident nearby in Yaoundé, capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then formed an infection that spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma, which should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon", so Georges Bwelle.
We had brought him out of Cameroon, if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years helping his father in crowded clinics and hospitals there to get treatment, which had to offer.
"It's not easy," commented Bwelle.
You can leave the House at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital, to be the first, and is not yet first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they need to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only a doctor for the 5,000 people, as the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, the most Cameroonians couldn't afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen had to see suffer in Bwelle mature decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 free operations in the last year.
He was even a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and provides free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday squeeze he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the artistic medical equipment on the roof over very rough terrain in the villages that need help.
Not always, everything runs smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: a banquet, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages, free healthcare is truly a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - is happy with his broad smile and his boundless energy - at the cheerful ceremony.
The next morning, the team then begins with the study of hundreds of patients.
"We treat Pro Ride 500 people", so Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 km to the village - walk.
Each of these Wochenendkliniken offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others are given crutches, donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for the school, but simply cannot afford many poor families.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or apartment; after surgery, the patients get up and go in the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is powered by the generator of the Group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work in the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It is a tough stint, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"You drums all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team rides back in the city, tired, but proud on the work they have done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has 700 free operations last year conducted and white, she cause an enormous difference for the people with their work, which helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a bar break, he had received, now enable him to work again.
"That changed the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the Wochenendkliniken and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he will finance 60% of his charitable activity, as Bwelle; the rest came from private donations.
"I don't know really, when he is asleep", says Katie o' Malley, a sophomore at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group works with.
He is always either in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the Organization, so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would get at home never.
"We at operations it might, where we help blot blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle", O'Malley said.
That would be never possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their travel to Cameroon and bring frequently donated medical material.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guide.
"He is a hero without a doubt," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is no burden.
To help others to a happier life, and to fulfill a promise he gave his father, gives him great pleasure.
"I'm so happy if I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain.

Pope Franziskus appoints first Cardinals in February
Pope Franziskus will appointed first new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest ranking cleric in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also choosing a Pope, so that Francis will nominate the first group of men thus, which ultimately will contribute to the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 Cardinals.
But a cardinal who has reached the age of 80, can no longer take part in the election of the Pope – that falls to a group of 120 "voting Cardinals".
In a statement, in which the message was posted, said father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, there will take place a meeting of all Cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of new cardinals will held, who was known as a consistory.
"Pope Franziskus has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the consistory for other meetings, which require the participation of Cardinals from around the world, can be scheduled in advance in February", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero Catholic voices said that the number of voting Cardinals will probably be dropped until February.
He said a Pope nominates as necessary, so that the number of voting Cardinals again amounts to 120, and want as many Cardinals over 80, as he usually so many Cardinals.
The consistory in the next year was so important, because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.
Currently, there is some overhang on the side of Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from around the world, to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics living in South America, but they have only a tiny number of Cardinals.
The Cardinals will be also the first to be appointed since the creation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight Cardinals from around the world, which have the mandate to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has selected these eight Cardinals to help him", said Valero.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far, we weren't in this situation - this is all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large locations would be appointed Cardinals, but put Francis 'full of surprises - so we know not whom he appoints".

Is Europe's elite willing to do business with the United Kingdom?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who provide wealth and work in the UK, want to change our relationship with the EU.
For this purpose, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders in order and asked them what they think about the United Kingdom, the economy and the EU.
YouGov questioned over 1,000 leaders from business, roughly forming the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
Many will be surprised by the results of the survey.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now exported outside Europe and focused on countries that modernize and grow, while the States in the EU remain stagnant.
You want that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored Government, instead of the long and tiring process to reside, to reform the obscure institutions.
Asked according to certain legally regulated topics - by the antitrust to product legislation - is the majority of the business leaders of the view, the control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market, since according to the company the cost of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits, being part of Europe's trade zone - voted even 40 percent of large companies, which are traditionally most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and probably say most, resulted in our survey of business leaders, that a clear majority hankers after a course in the direction of change of the agreement of the United Kingdom and a relationship with the EU that is not based on trade policy.
This knowledge, which can be found at companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is on a "meaningful change" is pushing, which brings the issue of action back to the UK.
There is a revision of the agreement much - and better conditions for United Kingdom 16 percent would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that the British economy behind his plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows the company by a renegotiation back expect a significant shift in the balance of power to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, after the euro zone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal Union.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be the priority, as shown in the result of our survey, which means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the approach to regulations for companies.

Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
You are not 100 yards away from each other: on Tuesday the new B 33 - pedestrian traffic lights in the village car park in operation - taken in Gutach in sight of the older Town Hall lights.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or Schildbürger prank?
Gutachs Mayor yesterday clearly answered this question.
"The Town Hall lights has been installed at that time, because it assures the school", Eckert said yesterday.
The Chester traffic secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The plant yesterday officially in operation was important for the Sulz Brook road/Church Road junction area.
We have the Museum, two churches, Park, bus stop, a doctor and a Bank of the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"At the high transport and pedestrian traffic a more light needed to their safety", so Eckert.
Also Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office confirms this.
"According to current measurements every day some 12 000 vehicles pass through the village of Gutach on the B-33, of which about ten percent are heavy traffic", Arnold stresses.
Therefore, the construction of an additional traffic light was more than necessary: "Safety just happening", so Arnold.
A total four road shows were conducted, also a roundabout has been considered, however due to the tightness in the Sulz Brook road/Church Road junction area again discarded.
According to Arnold at the location of the light masts before everything tested out: "By means of an extra for us with extra long tree trunks of loaded vans we have from tested, whether these vehicles out of the way of Sulz Brook on the B-33 can extend without fold over the traffic light poles".
The approximately 15 000 euro expensive traffic light itself is the "State of the art, what is there currently on the market", said Arnold.
The plant is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so strong, that the lights of the car drivers, for example, even with low standing Sun are well.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 Watts, the new just eight Watts.
Pro Ride direction there are three lighting systems.
Arnold said the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
The pedestrian pushes the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
The road is clear, if not coming directly for the pedestrian green, it takes about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor checks to see whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"Should a group or handicapped people go the street, the green phase is extended, it comes so everyone safe on the road", said Arnold.
Of course, motorists must here thinking as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the traffic lights for pedestrian green, an upper class vehicle swept through - bright red.

Today published a discussion of the Government, after the former MP of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, who had condemned the comments of the Government with regard to foreign workers, because this could be considered by neighboring Australia's insult.

Historically this meant that white workers should - be protected and if some in the region vernähmen an echo of this historic artifact, that wouldn't surprise me.
The discussion outlines twelve measures, which once were considered by the former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who yesterday was to discuss human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, others are still under consideration.
If the "authenticity criterion" is applied, then someone who applied for a visa, could be assessed in terms of whether "the request in the cases is real, is related to where the applicant with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company or personally connected."
Companies could be required also to give an account of the number of the 457 visa holders, after in the past companies, only a small number of workers wanted to support, hundreds have finally adjusted.

Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late, and dress us up for the neighborhood.
Today, I've rather become the Halloween muffle.
In the last two years have I not agreed me to distribute candy from my apartment and it won't do well this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep, what about Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year and spending doing total 6.9 billion US dollars for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of retailers (NRF).
The trend values are one thing on which I am then pleased every Halloween.
The costumes will be approximately 1.2 billion of 6.9 billion U.S. dollar spent, so the NRF.
Sluttiest inanimate objects are the rage this year.
Women must no longer wrap themselves in sexy clothing, they can embody now also seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
I lots of zombies thanks to the expect walking dead, as far as men, and I bet, the Daft Punk space men will succeed this year in the Instagram feeds.
According to Google, there are the most sought-after costumes Batman, pirates, zombies and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We have dressed our dogs last year and were thus to my amazement not only.
Actually Americans spending this year for your pets costumes $330 million, the NRF.
There are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As far as candy, we're not squeamish.
Americans will spend this year to $1.9 billion so the Nielsen Company.
These are approximately 270 million pounds of candy bars, lollipops, candies and jelly beans.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce according to 41 million people who draw saying "Trick or treat" by the district.
Actually we will buy about 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - we delude ourselves - eating.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sweet candy corn; Nevertheless, it sold 15 million pounds to Halloween so the national Confectionery Manufacturers Association.
These are about 9 billion kernels.
It's a mystery that I still could not solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween as houses, haunted.
You have great names like "terror behind the walls" (which by the way, stands in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There's actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, achieving $500 million revenue, so America haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos, in which man is pissing in the pants and friends make on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them, and then the type on which you stand, one such as "nice face" will leave a comment.
But we come finally to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made acquainted us with the great pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o'-lantern is something like decorating the Christmas tree - the we made small on have.
Fortunately the "baby into the pumpkin" began trend last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up so, your way to carve the pumpkin, not to sit.
This year about Americans will spend $106 million for pumpkins, so the US Census Bureau.
The Jack-o'-lantern that slowly rots in the front yard, probably originates from Illinois, where this year's 245 million pounds of Pumpkins were harvested.
If you really want to score, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty from its 921-pound pumpkin.

2009 extended the leases for the company at Circular Quay, which annually brought the whether Eid's $2.5 million, without public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of port from February 2006 through November 2009, had originally advocated public tenders.
But he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as confirmed by Sam, had been pressing a refactoring of the Government lease arrangements.
A phone transcript presented the ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior civil servant, which was changed in the harbour Department, after he had worked under Obeid at the Fisheries Agency.
"The theme discussed in these telephone conversations was the development of the commercial lease arrangements?", asked the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," replied Sam.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was not definitely.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.

NSA revelations strengthen corporate paranoia about government monitoring
On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter flew deep over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On instruction of the Federal Office for constitutional protection and counter-terrorism (BVT), the German internal secret service, he should shoot the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the bat was going to prove the presence of monitoring antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, American Director of national intelligence, was in September, again making sure that the United States used no possibilities of foreign espionage, "in order to steal the secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies, so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profit."
But since Edward Snowden, the former employees become the whistleblower, has begun with the publication of his cornucopia of American surveillance secrets, European Governments and corporate executives are not sure whether they can take the Director at his word.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company of Petrobras and procured are data of American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the corporate paranoia because of Government monitoring to a new high.
The last straw for iterating over the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly already for ten years.
If the most powerful person can get into Europe in the visor, then also managements are potential targets.
Snowden has made transparent to the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it is conceivable that these data be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the United States now presented a risk almost as large as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, so a survey released in July by the consulting firm of EY.
The documents leaked by Snowden there but so far no evidence that the United States gave the secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians have their concern expressed about, that the EU lacked specific IT - and Internet opportunities and she should reduce their dependence on the United States.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Bundestag, it was suggested we should build a German Google.
I can close my eyes and slowly open it...
"It doesn't work", says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, then you should let them become extinct 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized by the coal cars up to agriculture.
Everything on the IT industry.
However, have coverage and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations shocked companies, who had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
Cloud computing, a major change will take place because European business leaders are now conscious that in the United States stored data of the case-law are subject to and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to one of the cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, survey conducted about ten per cent of the members resident in the United States not rejected after the revelations about the U.S. data-mining activities with Prism plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "we see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago--she is: where my data is stored and can ensure that they remain physically in this area of Justice?"
Many German business executives argued that the recent reports confirm just what they already knew, namely that powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets and this therefore be guarded at all costs must.
It is no surprise that economic espionage takes place.
It was always thus.
"It was an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of chemical company BASF.
Americans spying on us commercial and industrial level, so how we do that also, because it is in the national interest to defend our company.
Corporate governance not normally brags about the countermeasures that it has taken, because that gives you benefits attackers.
In large companies has long been blued a staff that taking a free USB sticks at a trade fair or the unsupervised leave of a laptop in the hotel room was not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Board member at automaker Audi, says that it belonged for years to the standard practice, to collect the phones before a Board meeting, so that they can not be used as bugs.
The German bat advises managers to use simple prepaid cell phones, when they go abroad, because smartphones can be potentially compromised.
The prepaid cell phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
"The experience, the staff and financial resources small and medium-sized enterprises often lack, to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access", warns the bat in a report.
The United States own companies warn of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post were in the U.S. National Intelligence estimate in the February of France, Russia and Israel behind China ranked two of the countries classified, which is used for the procurement of economic data of the hacking.
A member of the Board of a German blue-chip company agreed to when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, spying on its allies."

As the horse-show experts in droves in Cardiff found themselves up, to Crown the horse of the year, were aware that a tough competition fight was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The tot, which is not even in kindergarten and only a few months ago has made its first steps, and his Shetland pony trotted toffee loose through the three rounds and won the first prize - where they had 30 adult opponents behind.
The lovebirds pair, both the same size, were due to their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition praised, is organised by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had placed his beret at a saucy angle and led the two-year-old toffee by the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which would be far beyond his age.
And toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had his third birthday get toffee last March as a gift and practiced since then every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field and went with Gold Cup and rosette from the square.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Entirely foreign in the arena thought he was so phenomenal, that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, follows South Wales, in the footsteps of his aunt of Sharon Howells, who shows horses for over ten years.
Howells told: "the whole audience was as electric and all have fired him and clapped."
He ran the entire length of the arena on the sand, and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, which he takes.
So how it is started, it will not take long, until he is on the "Horse of the year"-Schau - and I'm sure that he will do well.
A spokesman who said the annual Horse Show: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how he should deal with his pony."
Together, they are a great team.
The judges then evaluated Fenton and toffee how well they would have beaten and presented in the demo ring.
Pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and leader - and as Fenton and toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton's sweet clothes has played its part in this, it fit perfect for the occasion.

The tourist destination of the foresight coincides with the aim to obtain the now heavily grown to old pastures Allmendfeld through opening and connection to the existing pastures and with his specific protected habitat types according to Tribukait.
Certain species such as some rare butterflies and grasshoppers can not overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need this free connections to the conservation.
Tribukait said she wanted not fail at this point, to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this plan the current measure not only seamlessly insert themselves.
A biosphere region as ecological offer also the opportunity for sustainable economic development based on the internationally recognized status of UNESCO and thus a continuous addition of achievement with the life project, as well as the previous days of care for the future.
After this finishes Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff shared a the Assistant area manager Christoph in groups.
The larger trees were already beaten in the run-up, the forestry tractors stand ready if necessary.
A group of workers should take care of the exemption provided by juniper bushes and to maintaining a dry stone bar.

Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian Government insists on the tough conditions that are associated with the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian public health, to ensure that the Federal Government can not waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis, which was caused by an ageing population of the island State, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system limitations.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after Government consultations with the independent Tasmanian Parliament Andrew Wilkie.
The Government "has put together an emergency rescue package, which is in our opinion the unique challenges of facing federal State", Plibersek said today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million emergency aid for optional services.
More 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for cataracts, residues should be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up after inpatient stays, specialist training, services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas of which concerned hospital staff have told me, they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system", said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The State must maintain the current level of funding, to get money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the additional monies were spent.
A three-member Commission is set up and to make sure that the State as effectively and efficiently as possible is providing health services.
Wilkie said today, the $325 million would are of little help, if "not accompanied by real reforms, bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course."
Nonetheless, he praised the Government that she have will respond to his request for urgent help he brought first to the Prime Minister early in May to the expression.
"I am confident that the Federal aid will make a large contribution to take the public health system of the State of the list of worries," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the Federal State, these optional services will largely make up for the recent cuts.
However, the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement was only a "band-aid solution".
"We are therefore in the current situation, because the labor State Government has deducted $430 million from the health system", he told ABC TV.
It can not be that a State Government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth put into 300 million and then pretend to be good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of bailout for extra bureaucracy might be given out.

You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip k. Dick a God seeker, a Metaphysician, was his novels and stories have some serial.
Amazing the relationship in the exterior: the piercing eyes, beard, high forehead.
And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky to understand with his massive oeuvre as ER founder and apologist of the Russian soul, reading Philip k. Dick as American Prophet, which is quite something in their own country.
Some titles are published by Heyne, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the Empire of stunning technological progress coupled with paranoia, obsession with security and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the book of revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was mad, had used drugs to his brain.
He got that early, that the computers are Divinitäten.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked, what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator of his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner"-problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott and Paul Verhoeven.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "minority report" was constructed in 1956, he exudes the odor of the cold war and the McCarthy-tribunals.
It is here the principle of the "pre crime" developed, "Pre-Crime", so that what is now more-or-less official doctrine of the White House.
Look into dicks world, frighteningly similar to ours that mutants in the future - and the police access.
"We capture individuals who have violated no law," says the CEO of the authority.
"We grab them, before they can commit a crime of violence".
And: "in our society, there are no felons, we have a prison of full of Pesudoverbrecher". Read time flows.
You assume that happens bad, and prevent that the criminal idea is implemented in the Act.
Dicks narrative acts as the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA tapping noise.
Anticipation of the attack: how Obama's drones philosophy and practice.
But dicks story is not yet over.
The police chief complained that there were no more separation of powers, the military controlled the everyday life - and what's left of the State.
Then, he is navigating even monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is crazy.
It is perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own requirements.
Take mistakes and victims not only in buying, but is based on it.
The system creates the danger that fought it.
Philip k. Dick read is called, again and again, getting closer to the truth.

Court blocks of the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy decision
On Thursday, a federal appeals court in the United States blocked the order of a judge, the changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department had asked, and gave birth to the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of appeals said the decisions by judge Shira Scheindlin would suspended until after it had decided on an appeal of the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way, how will implemented the program for stopping and questioning of persons.
The city appealed their assessment and the ordered corrective measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body, which should support the police in amending its policy and the corresponding training program.
The Court heard the arguments of the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appellate report stated that the judge had to be relieved from the case, because she violated the code of conduct for us judges by is that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality This was partially justified with a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the Court.
The judge had ruled that police violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin men with the stop-and-frisk program targeted.
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms of policies, training and supervision, and ordered with body a pilot program supported cameras in neighborhoods, where most checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after an inspection by the police.
A hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled for March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics was criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind exist in various forms for decades, but increased the number of recorded controls during the tenure of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all time high of 684.330 in the year 2011, most of them black and Latin men.
2004 was by four men, who were all minorities, lawsuit filed, which developed into a class-action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the stop-and-frisk program of the NYPD say the changes will stop unfair practices create a more trusted and more effective police and affect the manner, as other police headquarters put the control.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; also would waste money and unresolved the broader problem of a police stand after the loss of thousands of bodies in the last decade under pressure.
The judge pointed out that she do not finish the stop-and-frisk practice that is constitutional, but reform just the way of the implementation of the controls by the NYPD.

Anger over sentence for Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who came in 2002 in the bombing in Bali killed reacted angry at the verdict for the last of the instigator, who was dropped as Umar Patek should be summarily in their opinion in court.
Patek, who yesterday for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bombing almost ten years as one of the most wanted persons of Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced to a prison term of 20 years.
With suspended sentences, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was the mass murder found guilty because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict was also in a series of terrorism-related charges, which included a wave of bombing on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor asked for a life sentence, also if it for the man, because of his reputation as a Masterful bomb-maker as "demolition man" called, could have requested the death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who has lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting tears, she said Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I mean, really, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"One should ask him before a firing squad," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day, that I will receive no other grandchildren and I never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23: 00 exploded a huge bomb in a small van, which was parked outside the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploding a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell after the attack for a month in a coma, and "died" three times while he was on a life-support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah financial - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the massacre were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
Life to him - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after he has killed 202 people and injured hundreds, not much is to get.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.
He turned away from this almost a decade of the arrest, was captured but eventually in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces earlier al Qaeda chief Osama bin almost four months later killed shop.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had provided the note, that Patek was in Pakistan, bin to make loading with the aim to rebuild the connection between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaeda.
"He has not made himself" Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for it, how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict was issued before the ten-year anniversary of the attack in this year, which is celebrated with commemoration in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can appeal even against his judgment.

Continuous red light: pay attention to wait
Sometimes a traffic light is not just green.
The detection loop in the road does not respond, or the sign of light is defective.
What should you do then - red?
An affected party has waited long enough at a red light, and the crossing is free, can he continue, the Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad" explains.
The wait must be but 'reasonable', which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes, before is assumed by the traffic light malfunction.

Profits at Bombardier after decline in delivered quantities and orders
The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline of net profits on Thursday, after he was advised by declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract issues in the railway sector under pressure.
Bombardier headquartered in Montreal the CSeries released no flight test data for his brand new aircraft and issued no new information, whether the plane according to the ambitious timetable could go in next September in the commercial use.
So far only three more starts, was followed by the maiden flight of the test aircraft and a half months ago which seems questionable whether the test phase as planned runs.
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, analyst with national bank financial, lowered his rating from "outperform" to "Sector perform" in view of the fact that the stock in the next one to two quarters has a limited upside potential.
"Although weaker aircraft delivery figures were expected as far as possible, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We are of the opinion that Bombardier new orders for the CSeries is obtained if the test program to the aircraft progresses.
If however in the coming months no new orders will be announced, we expect that the market will face more skeptical the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower segment of the market that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced in March of public and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far binding orders for the CSeries, with 177 are moderate, because potential buyers would wait and see the results of flight tests, whether the claims of the company with respect to fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new Düsenverkehrsflugzeugs are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President and CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier its target of 300 binding orders to the beginning of the commercial exploitation of the Jets will reach.
On Thursday compared with analysts and media, corporate governance also assured the program lay in the schedule.
"The test aircraft has remained no longer on the ground than expected," Beaudoin said during a telephone conference, adding that during the lifetime of the aircraft ground tests and software updates have been applied.
Every manufacturer of plans otherwise.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, what we have done.
This is done during the entire flight program.
It was the second of five test aircraft will start probably the rest shortly thereafter, in the next few weeks, by the company.
However, analysts remain skeptical about whether twelve months after its maiden flight of the first customer can take a plane of the CSeries in operation.
Bombardier said, check the planning for entry into service (EIS), and will update this in the next few months.
"The slow progress the flight test - even if they obviously comply with bombardiers of internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning the first quarter 2015 moves", Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30 fell Bombardier net profit of $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
Adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales eased slightly and declined from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, so Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates he had 45 aircraft delivered in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
Net orders fell by 83 aircraft on 26.
The backlog in the Aeronautics and space Division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on September 30 and was therefore unchanged compared to December 31.
"In the aeronautical and space were the results in the context of our objectives, but low order intake and the market as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aviation and Aerospace Division fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the sales in this Division by almost 11 per cent rose to 2.1 billion dollars.
The backlog in the Transport Division amounted to 32.6 billion dollars on September 30 and was slightly elevated compared to the 31 December.
Profit margins in the transportation sector was affected by processing problems at several large contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday eased the Bombardier stock by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after also announced that the Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will switch to the Board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, and Bombardier's closest rival, announced a ten percent decline of in quarterly profit on Thursday.

Rules on electronic devices in aircraft remain in Australia for the time being in force
Australian airline passengers must turn off continue tablets and smart phones during takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the United States to loosen the rules for such devices.
The American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change your preferences, so that passengers on their devices read during critical phases of flight E-books, watch videos or can play as long as they are in "Airplane mode".
During most of the flight, this is already allowed to passengers, but many people find it annoying that they may not read their E-books on the takeoff and the landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the U.S. airlines have to do tons of work, track but no immediate plans to change its rules.
The CASA's air traffic control authority, also said, you'll see the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
"CASA has currently no specific provisions regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft", was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions, according to which airlines will at all times maintain security and passengers must follow the safety instructions provided by the cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks about extending use of Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights with the CASA and says it is open to changes, this would have to be initiated but by the legislature.
"We would welcome a review of the approved of electronic devices through the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, after we now (Wireless Entertainment) offered during the flight", a spokesman said.
Qantas said it will remain until further notice in the current regulations.
"Our current regulations stipulate that electronic devices should not be used during the launch and the landing, and we have no plans at this time to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to American Airlines.
We are the FAA decision however always to developments in regulations interested passengers can benefit from, and be as well as the reasons behind it certainly look.
The decision affects different U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
You must prove that their aircraft can tolerate the interference by mobile devices, and you can change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer training.
"Once an airline has confirmed its fleet the tolerance, she can allow using portable, lighter electronic devices such as Smartphones, tablets and E-book readers at any height passengers", the FAA announced.
In rare cases when visibility is poor, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during the landing.
The Group also recommended to store heavier devices during takeoff and landing safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats.

Scientists could shed more light on how that relates a dog with its tail wagging.
Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail more waving to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while it was the left nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs may perceive these subtle differences and respond to it.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist who University of Trento, said: "in humans is well known, that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli, which cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried in other species to look at this.
He also remarked that the right half of the brain for the movement of the left was responsible for dogs just like humans and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles with the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react on the lateral tail wagging their kind, the researchers monitored the animals while himself saw these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of dogs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail times even moving in the, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "we showed movies with dogs the dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we could control more movement of the tail to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog has moved the tail to the right (as viewed from the perspective of the flying dog out) they were totally relaxed.
But the inclination of the tail was mainly left (again from the perspective of the dog which wags), so your heart rate increased and she looked uneasy.
According to Professor Vallortigara dogs not intentionally communicate by these movements.
He believes, instead, that the dogs from experience had learned what movement they should worry and when not.
He said: "When you have various encounters with other dogs and the wagging tail in one direction is rather associated with friendly behavior and the right hand side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond based on this experience."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and visiting fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine of the University of Bristol said that this was not the first study investigated whether left and right for dogs is important.
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn upside left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it's a happy dog.
Of other research at the University of Victoria in Canada was the following: "rather go to dogs on a robotic dog, if, cock ' left WAGs and not right, instead restless - exactly the other way around as in the Italian study."
According to his words the differences could derive from the fact that the dogs in the different studies not interpreted by the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study, how dogs respond to real dogs that could help, he said.
"While there is considerable evidence of many different mammals, that the two halves of the brain are used for various purposes, but many of the details must yet be determined - and dogs are no exception," as Bradshaw.
Because her behavior but simply record, it will probably not long until we understand why the tail sometimes sometimes moves in the one in the other direction.

Pawn shops are booming in Singapore since the crisis in the middle class has arrived
In a pawn shop in the shopping centre of Bendemeer in Singapore Dave Amirthalinga trades a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings, to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I bought a House there all my money in there," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earn each month 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) as administrative assistant and her husband work, monthly family income was not sufficient, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of South-East Asia - where the indebtedness of households is increasing - is so great that ValueMax, where she made their Exchange, this week became the third pawnshop, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The bonding of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money - Singapore $ 1,300 in the case of Dave Amirthalinga-, but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore require an annual percentage rate of percent 17, which is located just above the 15.4 percent, the United overseas bank requiring a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pawn shops offer the advantage that here no credit verification or proof of income required, which is why loans are faster than possible with banks.
For this reason millions of people in the region at pawnshops, contact after families feel the pinch with rising cost of living as well as a growing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economies, lower and middle income families go to pawn shops, so when stuttering economy to compensate for the difference.
This week the rating agency described as a risk factor to the credit worthiness of Asian banks standard &amp; poor's growing household indebtedness, mainly due to rising mortgage.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product, according to the Agency.
An increase of 60 percent in the year of 2008 stands at 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, Malaysia.
Economist worry also because of high consumer debt in Thailand, which came out this week just from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a slackening of consumer demand.
"In effect, this means in the face of rising costs the people in the Middle will try to lower segment (of the income scale) to supplement their income, where that is possible," said song Seng Wun, Economist at CIMB, a Malaysian Bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the last two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal property, as people take advantage of the opportunity to transform the family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, there are about 70 percent of the pledged items in 200 mortgage homes of the city-state of gold.
People are saying: "The gold price looks good, let's Grandma's gold chain pledge and bring back next month."
Thai's largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, saw a 20 percent increase in customer in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, operators of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 other would like to expand in Singapore, not only in the neighboring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside of Asia, so yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company financed that with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which this week took it with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders because of high interest rates be get caught in the crossfire, that pawnshops offer not only more favorable interest rates as other lenders, but also increased the debt not directly stated yeah.
"Customers pawn items that already have them, and not the budget however increases the Liquify of personal valuables", she explains.
The mortgage lending business is increasingly socially as short-term, secured financing accepted.
Also are not all people who use pawn shop in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore come in the branches of ValueMax, mortgage gold bullion and Rolex watches, what they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social layer come to us.
"These include wealthy, who temporarily borrow for a business or investment, or small businesses that need to overcome bottlenecks in the cash flow", says Yes.
Sometimes, simply just very quickly, they need money.

Rangnick scolding for refs: mane no Schwalbenkönig
So happy Ralf Rangnick red with the current top form by Bundesliga front-runners Bull is Salzburg, as the Sports Director of the "bulls" of the referees was disappointed.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that mane and Alan are squeezed into the category of swallow Kings", he took the two Offensivwirbler on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
Recent Rangnick criticism was yellow for Mane in a 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which an alleged acting doomed the Senegalese - which of course was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant mistake", said Rangnick, who described referee Haidery as "completely overwhelmed".
Haidery would also have "its part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game contributed.
He defended his German compatriot decidedly: "Because I would have behaved right in every single situation like Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself will have no contact after the skirmish with Halladay with his colleagues.
I don't why.
"Because I'm the one who was offended," the age said.
Given the run of success, Rangnick, but agreed a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words: really good", he noted.
There is not much to criticize.
Especially the way in which the team plays, is impressive.
This should go on quietly.
In the winter transfer period, there would hardly be squad changes.
There is no great reason to change something.
"Unless someone comes up with the desire, that he wants to leave the Club", clarified Rangnick.

The British Government announced a study that will enhance the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd proposes achieving already at the beginning of phase 1 in the year 2026 high speed links between Scotland and the North of England.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring together United Kingdom".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
On completion of phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of the construction of the high speed road between London and the North of England by 32.7 billion pounds on 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 Ltd, to search for more track capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of eventually three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network, bringing together Britain and its cities."
We go ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous advantages.
Without it, we face a capacity crunch in our railway network.
But it's also about the connection between 18 UK cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Keith Brown Carmichael urged on behalf of the Scottish Government, "unequivocally" the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network to engage in.
Brown said: "the high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits to Scotland, at the same time, but also the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
Therefore, we are pleased, as a partner of the British Government to work and exploring the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland which creates benefits for all and complemented the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I am looking forward, with the British Ministers next year to review the investigation report and to decide the next steps together.

Living with prospects for the future
Actually, Waltraud lives fantastically Ries.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with greenery, an old stock of trees, nice neighbors, and not too much traffic.
In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.
"Don't be afraid I hope before spinning?", asks Waltraud Ries and shows on a fat Spider to the door frame.
I'm looking for a new apartment for some time for my husband and me.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason is however no spiders phobia, but the concern, no longer being able to cope with the many stairs to the House and in the home, at the age she explains.
Also: Since a meniscus operation the Mittfünfzigerin on my own body has need to know what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.
First recently published a book of hers titled 'happily reside in the age - which perception is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't at the age', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband in the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the Greens.
Today with mid-fifties, Waltraud thinks differently about Ries.
She also knows that she belongs to the few people, dealing with the topic 'Housing for the elderly'.
Most ignore it, as long as it goes.
Only the others are old ', she says with a grin.
Only when the suffering is really great, you do are thoughts.
'Then it may be already too late', so Ries.
In her book, the Interior presents 17 residential models for a self-determined housing for the elderly.
'What living form but select, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution there is not for the ages.
Even those who could afford the retirement residence in Tuscany or Brittany, should consider getting, he could be sick, too.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the local language is large in the Dolce Vita,' admits the book author willing to deportation.
Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of housing or the oft-cited retired WG.
Everyone has so his ticks and quirks in the age
'For me nothing would be so a shared apartment but', she says with a wink.
Nowhere near enough like in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At the age you need simply his retreat', so Ries.
A senior living community can still work, the author wants to exclude yet.
That should run but otherwise as in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you want to also just his rest ', she believes.
With this opinion it is not alone at least in the city.

Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned police investigation, drug boss to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense lawyer, who warned a large police investigation, because he was afraid, a drug Baron his secret drug addiction could be uncovered, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about the investigation to its activities in the drug trade, after he was been compromised by his own addiction to cocaine.
The lawyer praised by criminologists as "top notch" nicknamed "Bash" was arrested 2011 at his home after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in previous proceedings of the drug.
Civil servants observed how Scarborough (32) cocaine at the home of lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, delivered three bag, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the Bar Association.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried illegally to obtain information about the arrest of two men in behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police during a major investigation to the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police at a series of house searches, heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £ 200,000 of cash made sure.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction could be made public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm of Forbes solicitors in Blackburn, was found in two charges obstruction of Justice guilty at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial and sentenced.
He admitted to possession of cocaine in a previous survey.
The lawyer was convicted after police found in their investigations against Scarborough, that it had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went home to Bosbos and there put the drugs with a purity of 60 per cent in a black golf glove under the dustbin of advocate.
Shortly after he drugs had delivered, Scarborough was on the phone regularly with Ditta, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine communications between the two were exchanged.
In court, it was announced that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after drugs of class A in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards were discovered in tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer because this was his client, and claimed that the "attorney-client"privilege is subject to their discussion.
Ditta took his wallet during his arrest and was trying to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated he run an Office with his home address as well as in the workplace and clients would call home it due to legal matters.
In court it became known that he had telephoned key players of against drug trafficking, which he had represented some previously, after significant arrests and informed, what did the investigators about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should better than everyone else know that you are not breaking the law."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer because he has admitted too much with specific clients.
The relationship in question is not a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied drugs to his lawyer.
Part of his message was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of this people.
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He worked against the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Thus, Mr. Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was close to certain clients, in particular, Scarborough, and he has allowed that his independence was compromised.
Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing by himself and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, I'm not, and wanted to provide information to Scarborough, then I would wait no 15 hours, but do that right away."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead, of Lancashire police said: "Mr Ditta made the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment, as he began to purchase drugs by organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who hired him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure the public trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tries to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The serious and organised crime unit of Lancashire headed the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases of possession of cocaine and obstruction of Justice, what underlines our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We find and bring to justice.
Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison, after he had declared the plot to the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade guilty.
Participating ´ another thirty-five people on drug trafficking were sentenced to Gesamtstrafen 153 years for drug offences.
Ditta published a range of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job is to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality was the motivation for his work on his website.

Council takes trackage in the visor
To the level crossing "the deer" converted elaborately, to increase road safety?
Yes, the Councillors have decided.
Schiltach must take 220 000 euro in the hand for it.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve in the coming year the Kinzig Valley Railway.
Especially the safety at level crossings should be increased - regularly nationwide occur collisions of trains with other vehicles.
The municipalities agree to the reconstruction, they must take part with one-third of the cost, railway and Federal share the rest.
Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained the Municipal Council the peculiarities of Bahübergangs "on the deer".
There, the city is planning to build a bulge in the height of the tunnel mouth West of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, for example those that transport timber carrier, could there at oncoming traffic, without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber is therefore proposed to construct the city could widen the subsequent road in due time, to ensure a smooth traffic flow a required retaining wall.
This was in the City Council controversy, since some Councils were the need for a road distribution in doubt: Thomas Kipp brought the mood of critics to the point with his statement: "we need to take as much money in the hand because so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: the level crossing "Deer" become regularly used for timber transportation.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" will partly transported over this route, because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route Habakuk bridge because there not could turn onto the main road.
In addition the route serve those vehicles which may use the tunnel, as Umleitungfür if the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Refrain was that Kirchberg Schlossberg tunnel would need to be rebuilt and refurbished, as currently is the case in Wolfach, could the level crossing "on the"deer"for an extended period of time an important traffic come to.
The Councils agreed to let what the intended widening of the road would cost study.
Regardless was approved mainly the conversion of the level crossing with the proviso that the required retaining wall is built so that the town "station road", where appropriate, could expand the subsequent road for encounter traffic about 5.5 m.
The conversion of the level crossing at tannery could Tan, however, entail a completely different problem, concerning the access to the rapidly increasing "Geroltzhäuser way".
The Administration had examined the conversion plans of the railway from the engineering firm Breinlinger, because she had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser path then easily possible.
The investigation came to the conclusion that cannot be ruled out is that the slope conditions of the road could cause, that long vehicles sit on.
The responsibility for this in turn carry the town a road construction load carrier.
The conversion could therefore entail liability disputes.
Since the removal of wood as well as bend in its current state of development work, you should not agree to the modification of the level crossing, argued Haas.
Also the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle following the transition is significantly lower than on the other level crossings at this point, because beside the breakpoint Center Taormina, insist to the a good sight.
Even trains from the main train station here should be ready yet slowed down at this point, that no collision threatens.
Majority approval was denied the conversion of this level crossing because the town of Schiltach "would have to suffer the problem with vehicles fitting on", so the Councils, because the railway could retire after completion of construction from the responsibility.
The Panel of the tags at the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Kuhbach", for which already crossing agreements have been reached with the railway is considered to be not a problem.

Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly Senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of this dealer was accused of any wrongdoing.
To the instant message group of usher were banker at Barclays and Citigroup, people standing close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that she have taken steps against some of its employees, after the Swiss regulator FINMA had explained that she investigate an alleged manipulation of the Forex market in a number of Swiss banks.
World - engaged in the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss competition authority, COMCO, the FCA, the American Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - at least six authorities currently charges that bankers should have denied themselves in transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have initiated also internal investigations or receive requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years looking after cases of misconduct.
The news about these studies put traders in a region in turmoil, the trading units of investment banks has belonging to one of the most profitable in recent years, but this year was under pressure, because low volatility in currency limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid Forex market, but leading retailers are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
A leading retailer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms lead banks to, that "you can influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The message came out on the same day, when Credit Suisse announced it canceled this week exchange traded funds offices a merchant of London, after he late last year had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars.
The Bank informed the competent authorities promptly and works with them.
"We are sure that the dealer alone acted and that the matter has been contained," said Credit Suisse.

Coulson was a phone hacking for checking a tip
The former news of the Word Editor Andy Coulson was supposed to confirm a false tip about an affair of former Interior Minister Charles Clarke "Phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in trying.
Prosecutor Andrew EDIS QC said the Court at the old Bailey, news of the world a false rumor heard in May 2005 so that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive Special Advisor" to Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper that commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voicemails, and pursued them, but Coulson also phoned and left messages, as the Court was told.
"According to the public prosecutor's Office is Coulson, who is now Publisher of NotW's nobody who comes to the apartment of people and hoping to catch them red-handed, but faced one of the people with a history, to see their reaction," said EDIS.
He said NotW use three methods to research stories citizen: phone hacking, monitoring, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows the monitoring by the second, it may not be different.
How it looks with the first?
He knows about the phone hacking?
He denies that, but we say: "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors about an affair of Clarke's first of the feature editor of NotW picked up, was told a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby,: "Don't waste your time, together with Charles."
A band with voice mail from your phone by at least three occasions was seized in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found records on the computer of the detective on the Pawlby and her sister as 'Projects' were stored.
In time, as the searches, said EDIS ran Pawlby grandparents received anonymous telephone calls in which they were asked for information about them.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby supervised.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to release tomorrow which I would like to discuss with Charles."
EDIS said Coulsons activities in this story was followed by same pattern as in other important personalities, as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the jury heard that Coulson Blunkett faced because of an affair with a married woman, when he had an affair himself with co-defendants of Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue, to have conspired to hack phones between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup gave to the phone-hacking.

Early puberty: grow up faster
African American and Hispanic girls reach puberty as their white peers tend, as studies have shown.
Physical changes yet not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual Conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics's children Medical Association this week in Orlando, Florida, the Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents - normally this is no evidence that puberty occurs quickly," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indicators of development, such as for example growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor, show earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (onset of first menstrual period) in the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years until the menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but applies it "precocious", if breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, slowing down the process or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
For faster progress, tests carried out by an Endikronologen could be displayed, so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of a second string: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus a small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is restrained, regarding medication, but he admits: "Suppressing puberty can behavior problems and the feelings of girls temper, to be different from their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want, that their very young daughters have the period.
"You worry because of the risk of pregnancy, or how they manage the hygienic page", Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose Tochter ten got their days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
It came from the school home scared and excited, because she was the first in your circle of friends.
There are many comprehensive published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys go similar to like girls before puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise was the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged from six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and the entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, tends to be more African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty as their white peers.
There are different explanations for it.
An early puberty by all kinds of things seems to be affected by economic conditions through the air up to the genes global.
Another puzzle: While boys facial and pubic hair earlier is increasing, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not so pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors on the AAP Conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and young children.
"We have to be careful how we identify the real onset of puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult your pediatrician as they should talk with their child.
"This may mean that you must have a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child responds normally good.
Girls, early bloom, need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.

Before the station Derby against Schalke accompanying BVB pendant with flares had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins-arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced affiliated hard consequences.
Before the Friday match against VfB Stuttgart in the Fußball - Bundesliga, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustics, the is the viewer until shortly before the kick-off of the business between the German runners-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park offered.
The visiting fans with their chants were heard mostly.
The South stand against it, where are the most faithful of the faithful--and loudest--BVB fans, presented itself first exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battle cries.
The podium of the CAPO, which otherwise coordinates the common spirit, remained vacant.
And at the front on the grandstand blew a big flag with inscription "Section stadium ban" alone.
Just as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always first BVB player the place entered, momentary jubilation surged up.
When his teammates followed, but long not everywhere there loud singing and waving scarves -.
Nothing stirred in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South stand.
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel again past the positive experience days - Derby victory, victory over arsenal, renewal of coach Jürgen Klopp - listed was not celebratory mood.
Only five minutes before the kickoff of the CAPO climbed his podium - and until then almost with hands tangible tension erupted in a loud cry, when Daniels as usual asked off the mood in the stands at the stadium.
Last was the South grandstand at the series - as always and the loudest place in the stadium was finally here again as usual.
And no later than when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came with kick-off from the South stands, everything was as usual.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past few days.
Just before area Derby FC Schalke 04 some of Borussia Dortmund supporters visitors with had fired flares in the spectator stands and on the Court - and hit almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The match was kicked off late because of the chaotic scenes.
Borussia Dortmund boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmund ultras in his Office - and believed to be Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the ultra movement as a whole", the Borussia Dortmund boss announced Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, the Ultras Watzke forbade a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden it," he said.
We can not give up the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
Also ways of punishment were shown the Ultras - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, so Watzke, BVB will set a penalty until the end of next week.
"This is dramatic," Watzke is assured.
It may be interesting how the responses to the South stand then take.

E-Mail implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to technically secrecy of correspondence such as at the traditional post?
In the conception of the early Internet services was in the foreground to make communication possible.
Therefore it has taken the basic technical logs not to create a stable foundation for an anhören safe correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional E-Mail is more of an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" to "Benni" send an E-mail, are the computers of the two directly connected?
The email program or browser by Anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step.
If she has such a GMail account, Google would be.

Germany's largest State Church has an Offensivegestartet to promote the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible lack of pastors: the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its approximately 1,800 pastors and pastors will be halved after current position by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects, Pastor Mathis bardo (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service said.
It's attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine itself.
Bardo the Lutheran Church has been for the first time a pastor on a full point, to inspire young people to the study of theology.
Currently fewer and fewer young people choose after graduating, to study theology.
Bardo traces this to the process of Entkirchlichung: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
It characterized the profession of great freedom and diversity.
I am Lord of my appointment calendar and can put there my focus where it is important to me.
Pastors may be close to the people as a pastor.
You earned as much as teachers and could make a living well.
Certainly get paid in the private sector, but that had theologians a safe employer.
That do meet the young people of today, where it is a matter not only to career, but a sense of fulfilled work.
About 60 pastors retire go according to the Lutheran Church, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently per year.
At the same time, approximately 40 graduates of theological studies begin their Vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland and Wendland it could be in the future hard to fill positions.
Bardo wants to organise among other study days for young people and invite also celebrities, have studied theology.
The study of theology offer a broad education.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA staff members on allegations against Jonathan Lord accused of sexual offences
Two YMCA staff from new South Wales (NSW) were accused sexual offences in connection with children, before 2011 accusations against the nursery nurses Jonathan Lord from Sydney were raised, as was the Royal Commission on sexual abuse of children.
But when the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had declared you've "never to do with an incident of child sexual abuse in the Organization had".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another, a sports teacher of the YMCA Sydney Hall 1991 familiar to him because of abuse children had been sentenced.
Hare Gail Furness, an attorney at assistierenden of the Commission, said that he knew from the first case, but I know the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in asserting, "there have been external checks of the YMCA, where the YMCA was considered at forefront of child safety".
Evidence before the Commission shows rather that the YMCA additionally has been informed that he has received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of education and communities (Ministry of education) in August of that year.
Hare started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that management "I'm down" failed in recruiting Lord and not to ensure that staff were themselves via their clear obligations, to report violations to the child safety.
Lord had been sentenced for sexual offenses to twelve young during his two-year tenure for the YMCA at the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare but denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem, which have held employees thereof, to report Lords violations in relation to the safety of children.
The staff said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord alone with children was supervised them privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his lap, one said that he love to have it, and let kids play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose commanding officer was the Lord and who had asked for a training to protect children because she was concerned because of his behavior, said that the children Services Director Jacqui Barnat, who was the Chief of Lords in the YMCA Sydney, "very intimidating and that was very aloof most of the time".
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that these not would have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said their friendship got compromised rather with their judgment Lord why she had not reported it.
Hare said he told his view of the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW, that the lesson that have to take the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" affects "not reporting" by employees, and the Board voted to him.
O'Hare said the decision, the employees to sign non-disclosure commitments shortly after emergence of the allegations to urge was taken by the Executive Director of children services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said, this should prevent a contamination of the evidence what has been implemented but "overzealous" and bad.
The YMCA NSW was at the time, Jonathan Lord was busy between 2009 and 2011 there, not organization safe for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on child sexual abuse, the Commission said.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the setting, validation, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.

Tourism: Descent to the Romans
On 120 meters a sewer from the Roman period remains below from Cologne.
Who visited Cologne, not coming to the Cathedral.
Some 157 metres stand the two towers in the sky and make it the second-highest church building in Europe.
However, only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree spires, suspecting that there is to discover a lot also in the Cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is expert in Cologne underworld.
Meeting point is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the Cathedral for the guides.
The tour begins quite unspectacular: "We do, in the underground car park" says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only remained standing by the ruins of the ancient city wall, which was not too large.
Most users of the car park pass rush so today's the Roman remains and parking only.
But look more closely and discovered an archaeological site separated by metal bar on the D2 parking deck.
About five metres high ruins of Palm-sized stones can be seen.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," Schulze said.
Before going back to the light of day, Schulze allows participants on the upper level of the Park take a look into a dark, 15-meter-deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately not perceived.
Next stop of the tour is the Prätorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
Here, we see the headquarters of the once powerful man North of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
What is CCAA, asks a visitor.
"Is an abbreviation for" Colonia Claudia ARA Agrippinensium ", which means on good German as much as"City of Roman law and city of asked, founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the Imperial cult"".
And the Prätorium is the former Governor's Palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
By the entrance of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is 120 metres long here to be around.
Schulze guests cheer "You can go along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want to".
Still, Schulze has a surprise.
After he has obtained the key at the box office, he leads the group to a walk-in, 16-meter-deep shaft.
"We are now in the Mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath", he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washing.
Today, different water levels by changing levels of the Rhine are readable in the bottom of the Mikvah, the roots of which go back to the eighth century.
The Mikvah is part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for the construction soon to begin.
But still some years to completion.

George Kerevan: European unbundling is the choice the Scots
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about Passport checks in Berwick and secured with barbed wire boundary along the Hadrian.
In fact was in the Strathclyde template on the potential economic benefits pointed out, which would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe with it, but this did not matter - as expected - in the headlines.
Also, no one has mentioned that the EU Member States often bend their strict rules is, if it is convenient for them.
Because Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want out of the Scots.
So actually no story.
And one that has been in the years, that she already looks like a fossil: the first time I have the "Independence means passport controls" duck is at least 40 years ago.
This is an interesting point in the constant repeat of this ancient history lost.
Why should you expect from an independent Scotland, that it is dancing to the European tune?
Why the London pass against the Brussels Exchange, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great, after the war plan to the unification of Europe has been stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially died.
Everywhere in the EU gain ground parties, which are hostile to the EU, or want to have the euro as their currency on board.
Even in Germany nearly five million votes in the Bundestag election could get the Eurosceptic party alternative for Germany - until this year founded - for himself in September and effectively the free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) expel from the Bundestag.
There has always been local resistance to the plan, to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis turns out however as a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the straitjacket in which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the single currency, many people of consider, the European project had gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with that national governments create excessive budget deficits - this was the case only in Greece.
Instead the Eurosystem, has nailed down its members on exchange rates are favorable for German exporters – and German politicians would like to allow this.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, South Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut the wages and public spending - spurred by Berlin.
A deeper going European productivity problem lies behind the current budget and currency problems.
As a result of the "green" energy policies prescribed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry will pay twice that for electricity and for gas fourfold compared with the United States.
That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage codification of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry to being marginalized by cheap American shale gas in the corner.
As a result, a revolt coming the former cheerleaders of the EU, particularly in France.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which you could keep Germany at Bay and lift Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin needs Paris no longer as the gateway to the political legitimacy and put up its own economic policy Europe, which the struggling French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pens EU hostile, right-wing National Front has won just a crucial by-election and so that the ruling Socialists referenced three in place.
The most popular party in France with 24 percent of the popular vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party, the national front that she can not assume now is a split in the right-wing would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working-class French?
She want the EU elections next year use an anti-EU-, to forge anti - Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties in these elections do well - and this is very possible - then such a block could dominate for the first time the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I'm going: in the not-too-distant future the growing resentment of the EU and the common currency is to meet to the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but she will be rather something like "EDN (sovereign)", which was in favor of General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may adhere to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain distanced themselves from this project hoping to curry favor with the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone in the Atlantic rain will stand.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be small England a region (in last consequence).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which also belongs to Berlin and Brussels say what they where can put up.
I guess Scotland could go quite well in a looser European grouping, as long as we retain our own currency.
The cooperation with other, like-minded countries is easier in a non-Federated Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider to join Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP Government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won the 2011 a spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts, the labour Finance Minister Alistair had to take responsibility for Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous to decide now for an independence for Scotland, only then to get from Berlin and Brussels imposed an austerity.

But should the passengers do not expect that these changes be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would implement, depended on by the airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The airlines must have the FAA, that aircraft comply with new guidelines and that they have updated the training manual of the flight personnel, as well as the arrangements for the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it got already plans by some airlines, which would expand the use of portable electronic devices in-flight.
These airlines were also delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the State of the plan we could approve soon the expanded use of electronic devices", was announced by the FAA in a statement.
Currently passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices, if the aircraft doors are closed.
They may start again until, when the plane reaches an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
At the entrance to the landing to the passengers turn it off again and may not restart it, before the plane landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines, whose Flugzeuge be secured against electronic interference could allow its passengers even at launch, landing and on the runway to use the devices, the FAA said.
The most new airliners and other planes, which were converted at higher altitudes, for the use of Wi-Fi, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we cooperate in this regard with the airline - both will benefit from page" Glading said.
We are frankly tired of having to feel on this subject such as supervisor.
However, Internet connections were prohibited, for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the Authority said.
Passengers will be prompted to the flight mode smartphones, tablets and other devices.
So still no "words with friends", the Scrabble-like online game, playing the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his Smartphone, he public had to leave an American Airlines jet, because he refused to switch off the device, while it was parked at the gate.
And heavier equipment such as laptops must also continue to be stored, since here a danger of injury, if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone conversations are also prohibited during the flight.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls between the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA revokes ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing may be
Last month Mark Rosenker of the road safety authority National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News said phones would still considered risk.
"Mobile are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can disrupt also masts", so Rosenker.
An Advisory Committee of industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue in life, recommended last month that the Government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure has risen to the FAA to loosen restrictions for use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argued that there was no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, that forgets to turn the unit off up to a third of the passengers or ignored is.
The FAA started in 1966, to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers after reports of interference with navigation and communication devices by VHF radios carried by passengers became known, which at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA, that electronic interference bother them.
Airlines offer passengers for several years Wi-Fi when the altitude is reached.
The flyer adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for the wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices give generally much less phone radiation than previous generations.
E reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if you scroll around.
But the transfer values are stronger during the download or sending data.
Amazon.com is one of the supporters of a loosening of restrictions on device use by passengers.
2011 invited an airliner full of Kindle E-reader company employees and made a test flight, to identify issues, not observed but.
The FAA Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings, regarding the risk associated with the use of equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger Association of National Association of airline passengers said, he believes, the interference by the device was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other Committee members said there were only scattered reports of pilots who militated for a disturbance of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
The Committee recommended however the FAA to allow pilots to order switching off the devices by passengers in instrument landing under conditions of poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a reasonable accommodation for travelers who are today extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience not contrary to the safety stands," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.

The speaker right at the beginning makes it clear: the pig thighs are the most important for the ham, Turbo mast is not a good condition.
Ham, you get in every supermarket, can be a quality product?
As head of a large ham factory in the Black Forest, the functioning of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf ULI explains jumbo.
"Germany's favorite ham", such as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.

Spotted jumbo to strengthen at fast food in Waldshut
"Here is worked, huge amounts of me" amazed the television makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 drumsticks per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat percentage, color: Uli explains what is quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the pH of the meat play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"Since I am curious, if ye mete Roberto Blanco, what happens then", so Jumbo cynical.
The level of private television in its purest form is presented here.
But worth watching.
The viewer sees that breaking down the leg is still handmade.

Freudenstadt: Fast action take by surprise host
With a small squad, the men I TSV had to make Freudenstadt in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Älbler were indeed with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
But soon showed that they, also age-related, not quite could keep up with the quick actions of Freudenstadt.
With the hard and placed spreads, the Gönninger did hard extremely.
Repeatedly missed it that by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean passes zugespielten power Center and attacks and were on the block defense not to the point.
Two high first set gains clearly expressed the superiority of Freudenstadt in all respects.
In the face of this overwhelming and decisive game performance the third set became something feeble and listless 3-0-full time (25:13, 25:14:25: 22) won.
A much more powerful opponent is there on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which clearly prevailed in Nagold, on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dabbous, Felix P.s, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class the second teams of Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
You delivered a hard-fought two hour match.
Nervousness on both sides especially in the reception of the ball caused errors and point gifts; also in the passports, the precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical scenes, the zeal prevented the look for possible point gains.
In this performance very balanced encounter the great physical and a pleasing commitment of both teams agreed the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto but consistently.

Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to include early residents in the planning", Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens information event to the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants arrived in the Community Hall to let explained the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Hale made it clear: "The ultimate decisions make the members of the Council".
The flood, which took Gechingen on May 15, 2009, was a dramatic event that raised the question for protective measures for the future, so Hale.
A river basin investigation had been given with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, in order, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"As many cultivated land protection is the goal," Halimah.
The planning is based the protection against a flood to be expected statistically every 100 years according to the German weather service.
Climate change will be taken into account by a 15-percent surcharge.
This is called "HQ 100aKlima" in professional circles.
The water masses that 2009 had resulted in Gechingen considerable damage, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement", so Hale.
To achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be, invested in Gechingen, whereby the community can expect with land grants amounting to about 70 percent.
Hale but pointed out that the promotion is there only if an overall concept will be implemented.
This is the community on the participation of citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedures must be completed.
2016 could be started to implement in the best case.
Among other things, the protection concept, which already was presented last week in the Council (as reported) foresees local measures in the tributary of the river IRM Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to voice their concerns.
Among other things has been questioned, why not more dams and reservoirs to protect of the site were planned.
Gregor Kühn, planners of the responsible Engineering Office of forest and Corbe from Hill's home, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all introduced measures to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, it was held to find the most economical solution, so Woods and Corbe Wald of Joachim.
Resentment was among residents of the old town, who repeatedly suffer even at normal rainstorm under an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known to the management and initial measures have already been taken.
Halder pointed out however, that the guidelines for channel systems are others, for flood protection, and this should not be mixed.
The municipality was required to produce the sewer system so that two-to three-year rain events could be coped with.
To dimension the sewers, larger oil could cost millions.

The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new Café.
One that invites you to relax and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling, having already experienced or seen a new situation according to the lexicon.
In the case of the visit of the homonymous Cafés on the Opschlag in the District of Kleve within sight to the Hochschule Rhein-Waal, it must not remain vu feeling at the pure Déjà.
Finally the café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: to make an actual stay not only intellectually, but by hand always recurring experience.
Because it is fun and is just beautiful.
A look into the inner workings of the Opschlag 8 gives a good feeling the viewers right off the bat.
The State of the art, but not cool Café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team offers the guest with various coffee or cocktail variant with the founders of Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top.
There's delicious cake or individual fresh sandwiches.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already before the opening of the pretty Café at the Opschlag as restaurateurs a made name for itself: in Kranenburg, they introduced the "art lounge".
By moving to Kleve on the Opschlag, the sympathetic Café lovers expect more audience.
Not least because of the College.
"While we have no specific target group," stresses Daniel Büttner.
Rather she would like to address just two young students such as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The sympathetic owner pair behind the coffee.
Enjoy the fragrant hot BREW in a variety of variations itself.

Daniel Büttner tends to be the cappuccino drinker of Expresso fan and Mirjam van the Stelt.
"This includes a baguette - thats my thing", she reveals the NRZ.
There was two events even in the bright Café.
One rather.
Because the harbour Festival took place Yes more outdoors - déjà vu Café not benefited.
But there was also the night of Ringelnatz.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", found the two 33-year-old.
But just not for everyone.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is also no outspoken fan of event evenings: "May's Yes now even not all right to make".
And an event I was talking to only that, who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will be more the exception for us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
Do you mean: Déjà vu also stands for reliability.
As regards the quality of products, which here are, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve, Germany.
The road, which are more and more becoming a food mile.
To the delight of many Kamuhanda, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the guest Rome haste and hence the Café Déjà vu for themselves.

Jumbo manufacturer arguing in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers has triggered a dispute over the width of the seats in the economy class on long-haul flights, what this month sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the seat width, which offered passengers on long flights in economy class not always those the airlines most seek but this designated space represents the key for the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.'s efficiency claims.
Airbus called an industry standard prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the American arch-rival Boeing says airlines should decide this week.
The dispute comes at a time, because aircraft manufacturers that compete to sell even bigger versions of its twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and record orders expected event from November 17 to 21.
How is the rear part of the aircraft - in particular whether there are series with nine or ten seats-, is crucial for the economic outputs, which will provide the new "mini Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims its modernized "777 X" believe 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and allow to ten per row.
Airbus said the competing version of the A350 promote 350 people in 18-inch-wide seats in economy class, where there are nine per row.
Aircraft giants deal often blows over technical details by means of advertisements in the trade press.
Now Airbus before the appeals Dubai Airshow, where 777 X probably will make the race with over 100 orders directly to the public.
Recently, the company introduced a display, which are the beginning of a new ad war could and donors showed a picture, in the three persons together-squashed in a restaurant the title sit, and: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul seats, which are narrower than regional turbo-props", says Airbus sales Chief John Leahy.
In the face of changed eating habits, people are fatter, but aircraft seats have not radically changed.
The weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years of age by ten per cent has increased between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, so the data of the Department of health.
The waist size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to us health statistics.
Airbus says his rival think on a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet set" was narrow.
You have carried out to Airbus, investigations showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increase sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the figures from Airbus to the mass of the seat and says, it is not at the discretion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines make the balance between fare and set up.
The company also said according to research the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
"It boils down really to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they need in their opinion, to succeed", explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver by Boeing.
They don't want that we dictate them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about the freedom of more elbow, but for manufacturers it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the confrontation is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could permanently affect the export record of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seating layout is the driving force behind the controversy over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent of more efficiency per seat with their latest twin-engined long-range designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300.
Boeing statements on the results of partly depend on the 777 X comparing to their 10 seats per row with the original design of the nine seats in the 777.
The higher costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing squeezing more seats on his plane so, to make it more competitive to our products", says Kevin Keniston, Director for passenger comfort in the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the closer position, what could go hand in hand with cheaper airfares.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: the Airbus offer the threat of the 777 is controlled from an economic point of view", says Mary Kirby, an expert in cabin decor, founder and editor of runway girl network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats on, but a catalogue of suppliers, which the airlines can choose from.
The globe-trotting Jet seller carry even tape to measure after the establishment of the competition.
Even if they praise the comfort, all manufacturers offer also jets with high density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater series, has not sold but according to his own words.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed how important is more customizability of cabins and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer's great modern jets, experts say that the reputation will probably fizzle out according to a new industry standard, but could distract from the wave of 777X-Verkäufen.

Veganism vegetarianism is subordinated according to dictionaries, differs from it but in a very significant way.
While vegetarians afford eating cream pie, ice cream, or a strong Edam, these feasts are not available on the menu of a comparatively?
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to refraining from meat and fish will drain the vegans of all consuming of animal products - honey is in the negative.
You may ask yourself what remains, but on closer inspection the vegan diet world characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Spreads are very popular," says Ute Hamilton, the owner of the local Reformhauses, which provides a wide range of special products for vegans.
Also, Reuben Proctor popular shop in Domgasse.
The native New Zealander living vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything, what he needs to live. "in 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarians".
Around the turn of the century, the next step was then and I was vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the food, but because the shoe choice", says Proctor, who prefers normal leather leatherette.
He realized that it's also in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, be an ethic is vegan.
"I don't want that animals for me to die," Proctor is the maxim of the vegan, which extends to the entire consumer behavior.
Behind restore mourn instead of burgers, scrambled eggs or Gummi bears have discovered the vegan fast new products, the enthusiasm has grown.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "actually vegan represents his no waiver, no asceticism, but it is an asset". The assumption that it will reduce the range of dining options with the nutrition, rather traces Proctor to the force of habit.
And exactly these conditionings gave also some well intentioned attempt fail.
"The addiction factor is a decisive factor that quickly abandon many leaves, similar to smoking," Proctor establishes a comparison.
And objects: "Certain tastes are not to make the animal".
It's often the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.
"You can create the same effect but also in other ways", illustrates the vegans.
Proctor brings, for example, aubergines, mushrooms, and also a few Veganwürste to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should certainly also once hearty taste.
Of course you want to have something in my teeth, which is legitimate.
"It should taste, but this is not only to reduce animal food", as Proctor.
Up to eating disorders, a more widespread acceptance, he had not suffered damage to health.
For me, the changeover was a positive aspect.
I take no foreign cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only vegan eats.
"My blood levels are fine, I often check me", says Proctor.
Many Vegansimus critics warn especially the deficiency of vitamin B12.
"As fed animals with feed, rather than graze on the pasture, it is questionable whether the proportion of vitamin B12 is high in the meat you buy in the freezer,", will Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to use the Coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 levels are in order," he explains.
Proctor for the procurement of food must not go long distances.
Staple it finally everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the spot.
Only once in a while I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that just finished products are expensive, but so, in"ordinary"finished products known to be also."
Anyway, preparing vegetarian dishes is far cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed.
"There is much to discover in the House kitchen, with a few small tweaks to good, if not sometimes better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, more baking soda and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake brought his in-laws also Proctor to amaze.
The vegan family festivals gives a new spice.
It has dynamics, together to Cook, has a new role.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, but scepticism was taken him.
No longer do you like my food?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - these questions one must act as vegans with flair.
"I don't dislike the people Yes, I'm part of this society," Proctor want to eke out no enclave existence.
And reexamined the everyday world is not so veganfremd as suspected - and restricted the vegan not so in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast Food is allowed.
French fries are everywhere!
"Many Dönerläden offer falafel at, or just a vegetarian Yufka," Proctor says.
He dodges on pasta dishes in a pizzeria, or ordered just a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants prepare so slowly.
"When I, started 13 years ago to feed me, vegan everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can identify a development: "One must talk to the people, that they draw attention".
"If enough issues to come, they are inclined to complement the menu maybe", he hopes.
Vegan develop restaurants, outlawed such as for example the galley in Mannheim or the Café.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants are on the menu at least a vegan dish have.
Basically are there vegan meals for all.
Everyone can eat them, they are so opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes are, however, exclusively, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor says.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a sure way to make the greatest of inherently impossible", says Proctor.
Shopping could be difficult at the beginning but vegetarian products.
Especially if you learn to understand that also peanuts animal food additives as a color timer included in its can, seems one quick compliance ethics with so many obstacles and traps with the courage to leave.
Not only because Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen, have written a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients used in food, but also detergents.
"After one developed a scanner look and know which characters and Proctor knows"It is sometimes better to do small steps as to stop or stumble,"has to make logos.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger, hitting on the consciousness.
Maybe it not quite manages that it pushes his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to challenge his habits.

Bavaria's basketball despite first defeat optimistic
Itself the first defeat in the Euroleague could not detract from the huge optimism at the rumours of the FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe to win against the best team in Europe of over the past two years," concluded Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening when defending champion of Olympiakos Piräus.

We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.

New nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure smoking kill
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further attempts is needed before testing on humans, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy once help millions of smokers who can, tried to stop and it tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that your nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches", so Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been altered so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies selectively.
The antibody Hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker learns no nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice, nicotine has been administered, maintained their normal activity level.
Mice without vaccination, however, had taken a "break", said the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science translational medicine.
Former tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the level of antibodies, that they were expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine are likely significantly lower, however, he transformed liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if he was sure, could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and prevent to nicotine addiction.
But more likely is that smokers would employ him to quit.
"You know then: if they start to smoke again they feel no pleasure more here because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to drop the habit", he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned it was necessary to further research.

Egypt inaugurated the first freely-elected President
Mohammed Mursi pushes the oath of Office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt", as he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected President, and so joined the successor of Husni Mubarak, was expelled from Office 16 months previously.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist President of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of State since the overthrow of the monarchy was about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the Court dressed in black robes, which has its headquarters on the River Nile and is modeled after an ancient Egyptian Temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on State television.
"Today the Egyptian people the basis for a new life has created - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability", said the 60 year old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that sharp had been taken since its inception 84 years ago mostly as a banned organisation by each Government in the visor.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Mursi arrived shortly after 11 P.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered before the Court, to cheer the new President, and in contrast to the presidential pageantry of the Mubarak era the traffic paused only for a short time, so that the auto convoy could cross the usually bustling street that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As uncharismatisches "spare wheel" the brotherhood mocked his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he portrayed himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those, who wanted to bring the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak at the destination.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State," said the judges in the wood-paneled Chamber in which he took the oath of Office the Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should hold his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem, which he listened to in pirogues.
The military commander field marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of present in the largest Auditorium of the University with chants of "the army and the people are a hand".
In the 1970s the University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath in Tahir square on Friday, to reclaim presidential powers to the birthplace of the rebellion, which last year led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed, the military Council of the head of State hunted from the Office had taken over.

Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
60 years as a singer Hubert Wermters history in the men's singing club Cecilia has almost double as long as that of the Herbsfestes, in which he solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter appeared as usual in the colors of his Männergesangvereines on the stage.
Even after 60 years singing with the more fun is still large as love gained choir him now probably.
In the Club Walsh was also active, including 28 years as a member of the Committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and his Club loyalty: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverbandes Rottenburg Stuttgart, presented with him - and a honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst as the choir is also a church choir - a Charter of the Association.
His vocalist colleague handed him the certificate of the German choir Association as well as an engraved pewter plates.
In addition to the ceremony ran 31 Autumn Festival in familiar ways: with the MGV amounts, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, Baisingen singer Department and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had loaded a smorgasbord of different choirs and vocal styles which entertained about 400 visitors.
The MGV full 7mood gene opened with atmospheric songs like "In the wine paradise" and "funny, her brothers".
They prepared their honor singer Hubert Wermter still a small song - Wolfgang Amadeus of Mozart's "Federal song" to honour.
The men's singing club Elizabeth sang also classical choir songs such as "Hunter advertise" by Julius Wengert, "far, far away" by Hubert Goisern and "When you're going through the folk song by the Valley".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten provided the "pulse"choir - with his choir and his group of women - the women of the Festival.
The mixed choir took with the Neapolitan folk tune "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva España" Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "pulse"Choir also back attack on foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer Department of Baisinger sports club came back with "What isch the Schwob?" by Hans in the domestic realm, where the Vollmaringer music society offered the grand musical finale Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "Beer song".
For the children, there was a small auxiliary program - "Grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer led a punch and Judy show and read a few stories, which well employed the lunch about the children.

Frontier Airlines charge fees for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 by passengers who want to stow carry-on baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines, intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though to read the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers should keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to carry-on baggage in the overhead bin above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.
Frontier said that you calculate when the fee shall paid in advance, $ 25, and $ 100 for travellers who only paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate o' Malley said, the fee of $ 100 aimed persuading travelers to take care of in the run-up to the payment.
"We would not calculate this sum", she explained.
2008, airlines began to charge fees for the first and second checked bag.
Passengers who tried to get around them, so as much as possible stuffed in hand luggage, which has resulted in that the overhead bins above the seat are often crowded.
Fees are a way to move to less take on board passengers to do so.
O'Malley said the new fee it a matter of not really making money.
It involves the most loyal customers of frontier, which would have brought clear that there would be harder to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website, don't have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the gate by frontier circumstances may take one piece of baggage free of charge, must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage the next person but.
O'Malley told the website of frontier and the check-in procedure would changed so that the passengers of the fee be informed before they came to the gate.
The new carry-on fee of frontier enters into force only in the summer, an exact date does not exist yet.
Passengers often ranting about luggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines fall like that.
They argue that the transport of baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service, if they wanted him.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines make enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
So far however, most keep their hands off fees for carry-on.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charges for baggage and followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airlines.
The only other airline with a such fee the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitored the additional fees said.
He estimated in a report by December 2011, the carry-on fee every year bring a spirit $ 50 million.
Sorensen, who previously held a management position with Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious what would expect him at the boarding gate when passengers would be faced with the unusual baggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was among the smoothest I've seen in my career in the aviation industry," he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and tangible discussions at the boarding gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding went smoothly."
Frontier follows spirit in the 2 dollars, which are required for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The company said that passengers, soda, or juice bought, which should keep the whole box and coffee will refill free.
Water is still free.
US Airways 2008 briefly attempted to charge for soft drinks, made this but seven months later reversed after passengers had complained and no other large company was drawn.
Frontiers step, to charge for carry-on baggage, if passengers do not directly with the airline to buy, is the latest initiative, with the customer on the website are to be channelled.
Airlines pay 10 to 25 dollars per ticket sold online travel agencies like Orbitz.
It provides all companies an incentive to move passengers to directly purchase from them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier is gone however most widely in this area.
In September, began the company, assign only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25 per cent of flight.
A flight booked at a third-party with frontier over 1000 miles brings customers to you therefore only have 250 miles.
Passengers can reserve seats only when purchasing direct on the frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business contracting, the company loses money.
The proceeds fell by 9 per cent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, how to read the financial report on Wednesday from the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., is released.
Republic has tried to get the finances of frontier control in the context of the sale of the company.

Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose Leiche was found, in a rolled-up wrestling mat in the gym of his high school are convinced that her son was murdered, the lawyer of the family declared on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta in the U.S. State of Georgia was found on January 11 in a upright made mat, which stood behind the bleachers in the school gym.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, doubting the family of 17-year old however.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the Attorney by Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, compared to FoxNews.com.
You would have never believed he had died so how the Sheriff have concluded it.
"They are of the view that it lacks any logic, contrary to the laws of physics, as well as against the common sense", to Crump.
Rather, they were confident the truth will cover up to protect the person or persons who are responsible for the death of her son.
"Her son went to learn in the school and came back in a body bag," he commented.
On Thursday, U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, since a number of important issues are still unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death a crime due to?
That said Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in which direction they do.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation", he said.
Said Moore told reporters the initial autopsy indicates that Johnson died from the consequences of a "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy have however revealed a different cause of death so Moore.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will rely on the FBI to conduct the investigations.
A representative of the authority of the County and not immediately upon our request was Sheriff on Thursday to a comment ready.
On Wednesday, a court in the South of Georgia ordered that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that have reviewed the investigator.
The parents of the teenagers said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence, as he died.

John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission of the US espionage was "inappropriate gone too far"
John Kerry has hinted a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States in relation to their monitoring programmes with an unexpected admission by saying that the espionage was gone in certain cases"inappropriately too far".
The Foreign Minister also admitted he bear the responsibility that you turned on "Autopilot", as the explosive revelations of Whistleblowers Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities together with Barack Obama.
The U.S. Government got from its allies in a diplomatic storm of indignation by the leaked information.
In a speech transmitted via video link to the open Government Conference in London said Kerry: "Without question the President and I and others have experienced in the Government of some things that are expired simply because the ability to do so was still on the second world war and the difficult years of the cold war almost on autopilot and of course goes back to 9 / 11."
Then, he of the U.S. Government admitted as a first senior member, that the US espionage have crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases that has inappropriate too far."
The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore performs a thorough investigation so nobody must feel, this abuse takes place.
I can assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not affected.
Kerry insisted however, that the NSA was a force of for good, and through its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We have to do it, people are ready to blow themselves up in the air with a new world."
There is a radical extremism in the world, who is intent on killing people, to blow up in the air and attacking governments.
So, what if you were able to intercept it and stop it before it happens?
We actually have plane crashes, attacks on buildings and prevented the murder of people, because we have experienced in the run-up to such plans.
Meanwhile, American legislators will travel to Europe, to dispel the misgivings of the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need, in the anti-terrorist efforts to continue with the United States to cooperate, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned because of their threats, due to frustration over the monitoring by the national security agency no longer anti-terrorist organizations to participate in.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism to stay aboard," said Murphy, who sits and is active as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on foreign relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington for the first time in the Senate as a Democrat.
Also I'm going to Europe, there to make it clear that we still must work together in the fight against terrorism, notwithstanding their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence agency this week said the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies had been collected and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations have quoted from documents provided by Snowden, stating that the NSA have monitored the phone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of State worldwide.
The Director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying among allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority preparing the journey of the Congress, which this year will take place, and hoped the delegation will include members from both parties and Chambers.
The names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary will worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is the improvement in relations, he said also that there would be some "serious words".
He said European Governments should be to honest about the kind of spyware their population, which they themselves for years.
Although we can change our monitoring programs, and better protect the rights of Europeans, they must come to terms but also with the fact, that we are not the only ones that spy, so Murphy.
Meanwhile a trip in the Middle East and Poland pending for John Kerry at the weekend, meet up there with the resentment over the American strategy in Syria, to deal with Egypt and Iran, as well as the U.S. monitoring activities.

Clive Palmer said Prime Minister Tony Abbott had conflict of interest when the parental leave
The billionaire and Member Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans to the parental leave because his daughters could be pregnant and therefore benefit.
The mining magnate, located in a court dispute over the payment of $6 million to CO2 tax, raised the allegation as he wanted to wipe issues off the table, if it were in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or shortened.
However, Palmer claimed that only Ministers might have conflicts of interest and by Abbott personally by the laws would benefit the daughters.
"It is located in a big conflict of interest, when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not it receives holiday," Palmer said.
Two months after the election the Electoral Commission Palmer explained officially the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax lead with 53 votes after the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the process to the counting of the vote, make this go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections two months after the end of voting be decided?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we have a system where one came in March, enters the data into a computer, immediately selects and then at 6:30 in the evening has the result?
Palmer criticized the use of pencils for marking the ballot.
To use them, because you then can rub out the results, if it's not to like?
It is unbelievable today agree with pencils.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint Bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that an international airport for the Sunshine Coast belong to his policies and that he will take his new position "very seriously".
When a public official, it involves the public service.
"We are seeking any reward except the history, namely, that we can serve this community in a critical period", he said.

ESA decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves and black holes - the European Space Agency experts must agree now on two major projects, that want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planet while other stars have already been astronomers.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: you should search for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and discover that perhaps alien life?
These questions just those responsible in the European Space Agency ESA.
For their program "cosmic vision" you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will significantly advance the research.
The budget for such "L 'missions is roughly one billion euros.
The start will be 2028 2034 expected.
In early September the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were to debate, five of them are now come in the shortlist.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, check for the researchers.
A final decision by the Scientific Programme Committee should fall in the next few days.
ESA has selected four major issues on which the missions of programme initiated in 2007 "cosmic vision" to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact operations are in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the formation of planets orbiting this star - still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this obscurity.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances life can arise there?
To investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is to start in 2017 with the 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity are investigated.
The possibilities are limited but, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments astronomers could represent Earth-like planets and analyze even the composition of their atmospheres and so search for "Biomarkers": gases, considered an indication for biological activity.
How does the solar system?
Also this question to indicate finally, what requirements there are for the emergence of life.
A star's magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as of his particles emitted with the planetary system plays an important role.
These operations can be an exemplary study in our solar system.
With the "solar Orbiter" ESA approved already an M-class Mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe should start 2017 and observe surface and activity of the Sun.
Even Jupiter and its moons are of great interest to researchers.
You want to find out what role played the giant planet in the development of the solar system.
For the ESA sees the first of the three L missions of the "cosmic vision" program before.
The probe of "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) begins their journey expected to 2022.
Eight years later it reached Jupiter and to examine the atmosphere of the planet, as well as the icy moons, Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the known laws of nature are still valid.
You might find yourself also deviations which could point the way to a new theory of the physicists, under whose umbrella unite all known laws of nature.
How the universe came about and what is it made of?
Our cosmos was created by the big bang 13.7 billion years ago.
In addition to the US common matter of stars, planets and living beings as we consist of, there is dark matter, whose Schwerkraft holding together galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, through whose work the expansion of the universe accelerating.
So far, the researchers know, what physical laws in the first seconds of the big bang were valid, nor what are dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" ESA approved here already a M mission, whose starting is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and allow to draw conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals only two are left at the end of the selection process.
An ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves has according to many experts "E-Lisa", the best chances for a permit as a L mission.
Including physicists understand changes in the structure of space and time, which had predicted by Albert Einstein nearly a century ago.
Demonstrated they were not until today.
Elisa could do this, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes will be stationed at all.
He could demonstrate also gravitational waves in contrast to plants on the Earth during the big bang, and provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.
Four other proposals still compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope named "Athena", which, among other black holes to explore, "Icy planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic microwave background, and the "Extrasolar Planet Finder" to uncover the Earth-like planets and examine.
Among other proposals to the samples back from Mars, the Moon, Venus, and asteroids, and solar physics research are already eliminated.

CDC publish allergy policies for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines, which published the American Government, increasing the number of school-age children with food allergies.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The dissemination of food allergies among children has increased between 1997 and 2007 to 18 percent according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools that the Faculty and staff to awaken an awareness of food allergies and allergic reactions show how to deal with children.
It is also recommended that schools epinephrine in stock - the car of the brand EpiPen injection is most commonly used - who encounter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction to.
The legislature changed recently the rules in the States, so that schools can easily hold epinephrine.
Also a list of typical symptoms is included in the report are called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels, as if pushing something on my tongue", "My tongue feels like a hair it is" or "My tongue tingles".

The 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry called firemen to the rescue of a shy, stranded
Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby was ran away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a Walker in the quarry in their predicament
Firefighters stranded off to cliff and rescued the dog before the safe death
Firefighters succeeded in bringing a puppy in security that was stuck on a 15-meter lead into a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby was running away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone, before she was rescued on Wednesday from a quarry.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend, Becky Hall, 20, belongs to the dog that came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to put Ruby back in reception and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and published calls for help in social networks, as it was on the loose after the small traffic accident in the quarry.
Around 14:15 CET on Wednesday, a Walker, who said his dog, saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the site and rappelled off himself to save Ruby's, which was then transported in a crate upwards.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: "she was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock face - 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
During their rescue, she moved a muscle - it was stiff as frozen.
But now it's fine.
She ate a few dog biscuits.
It was a pretty unusual usage.
The fact that the dog was discovered, is incredible.
Peter LAU, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a big happiness."
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet's Office to investigate, but found nothing except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall in Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "to watch the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe that she was really there.
It was wonderful to hold again in the arms.
The vet said if would be the exhaustion has become too large and they collapsed, she would be probably crashed.
The firefighters have done great.
It was really brave, what they have done.
We are just so thankful and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "we were afraid that she would fall off, but it stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.

U.S. border: "Super-tunnel" to drug trafficking discovered
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered a "Super-tunnel" to drug smuggling and shut down.
As the US Customs authorities informed the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system was fitted.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms cocaine seized.
The tunnel was not made yet according to use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could burrow through under the radar throughout," said the Deputy Public Prosecutor of the U.S. District of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference prior to a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
On the drug gangs used insured Duffy: "If your next build such tunnels and tries to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money".
The US authorities as well as the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 000 were killed people in connection with drug-related crime in Mexico.
Designed by experts
Due to the extensive facilities of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it has been designed by architects and engineers and that the building took about a year to complete.
The track layout was so equipped that there electric powered carts could be used.
There is access to a building is 80 metres from the border Mexican.
According to authorities, a ladder leads to the actual entrance of the tunnel 20 meters in depth.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 m high and 90 cm wide.
He would have been also suitable to direction of United States to encourage illegal immigration.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine finding.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the seized marijuana.
Lifetime imprisonment threatens all three as a maximum penalty, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels had been discovered, it was said at the press conference in San Diego continue.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in one such tunnel construction.
Usually is smuggled cocaine in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routing were now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA DEA in San Diego.
You would do anything to get into the United States.
To the arrested were no details announced, at least one was Mexican, it said.
They face up to ten years imprisonment.

Obama backed down in health policy
After severe criticism President Obama backed out yesterday on his often-repeated, clear pledge: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a termination letter, the Republican President accused in the last few days, he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
"They can keep the vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the layoffs, Obama urged those Americans who have received such notices, to look on the market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could get for the same price or cheaper than forecast as a better, more comprehensive health insurance.
"You get a better deal," he said.
The Government described it as a little surprising that the five percent of the population, who have taken out insurance, would have to look to a different tariff, because her contract Care Act is not the new standards after the affordable.
"I would like to say that Americans directly: you deserve better", Sebelius said at a hearing before the energy and Commerce Committee of the House of representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the affordable care Act, said that the launch of the online platform was "abysmal" run since October.
"I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else also", she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This phrase of a disgruntled Sebelius a seated behind her counselor at the yesterday's hearing in the House of representatives was recorded after a dispute with the Republican members Billy Long out of Missouri. It was whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
Long Sebelius harried after more than three hours hearing reviewed the question of why the "architect" of the affordable care Act have not voluntarily waived on a Government-sponsored insurance to complete yourself a tariff at HealthCare.gov the now millions of Americans would sell.

Parents of intersex children can "Indeterminate gender" select
Germany is the first European nation to a third gender for children is recognized, that were born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn is allocated not more rigid male or female.
Under the new law, more for such children must explain no gender parents, but can indicate "indeterminate" or "not set" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the Act is to take the pressure of parents, so that they need make no hasty decisions on operations for a sex assignment in newborns, and to combat the discrimination of intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later: "I am neither male nor female."
I stick the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one comes from 2,000 children every year as a boy or a girl to the world.
They belong to the intersex, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "Sex differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexed.
Understanding the gender identification is always not very well developed, but most experts in the United States to guess one should gender assignment using the best available information, if a determination is not possible and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide if any - for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law "sound like a good thing".
Intersex children do pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but that does not apply to most children," he said.
You could make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait as the identity can develop.
The scientific data about how a child ever developed its gender identity, are not very accurate.
No one knows why it is happening.
It's like the secret, which is why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it is called intersex people are indistinguishable from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gendered, but due to their biological Constitution, which neither exclusively male nor female, but typically at the same time or not clearly one of defined as both.
These properties were in subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also gives an overview about the discrimination that intersex and transgender persons in the working life faced as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not the sex image matching boys now have a special camp.
Now it is possible, on official documents, male, female in Australia and Nepal for adults or to specify "third gender".
In June, Australian Norrie may-Welby was recognized (52) as the world's first "genderless" person after a court had granted lifetime maintaining of a "not set" gender status.
German ID cards have a third assignment, X for intersexed, M and W in the future so the Ministry of the Interior.
In the neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a news story on France 24.
2011, dozens of French lawmakers of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school textbooks.
The American Web site Catholic Online has also the German law opposed, stating: "If dragged the world into a new State, where the gender a decision not representing sexual activity but then we turn the two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told zone baby, it would be better if a gender will assigned to babies at birth.
"The existence of the parents is already stressful enough, without additional restrictions especially if you don't know the gender of the own child", she told the parents website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically were children who both were born with male and female genitals, referred to as hermaphrodites, attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine looked at sex as something that you could wipe out and then rebuild.
But now, the ethical foundations of an operation be doubted, after is now known, how complex is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong too, because they don't know how to feel the child is growing up with the gender assigned to them.
"Mid-20th century it was called the a, psychiatric emergency '", Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then called not the psychiatrists but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia is Dr. John money of Johns Hopkins University back to the view represented the gender is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued, social and environmental initiatives - how parents raise a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped as if a person consider themselves as male or female.
But in one under the title of "John/Joan"-known case in 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was been separated during a botched circumcision not to castrate the child remove also his testicles and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he was not", so Drescher.
When the boy about was 15, he moved back to the male gender and married a woman.
With 38, but he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would use this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations to the public have appeared that are "not happy with the result".
Such as when Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and believed he could do a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were 1976 surgically removed shortly after birth and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew that I'm not a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should get a Vaginoplasty.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised at birth - and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, making his body could produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After he had learned the truth, he moved again to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts.
The operation is becoming barren.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the interface project for intersex people as normal to be perceived.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California-based legal group advocates for informed choice, worries that the German law "could encourage the stamp and Stigmatisieren".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents, quick to make decisions and the child, not set ' assign ', she explained.
We fear that promotes interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender, and then wait.
But still we do not know how to affect the law, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said, her organization supported the Australian law, because "it allows adults the recognition as a third gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender", she explained.
The German law involves the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight which should coerce young children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with sexual differentiation disorders and supported hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorize" parents as well as children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the target cells for testosterone receptor defect, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; She works as a researcher in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Though she is barren, but hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, which they need to make decisions not rushed", Baratz said.
It gives them time to make different tests and to clarify things and gives them such time before they write 'male' or 'female'.
In this way everything is alright - it pulls the child big and loves it.
It has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parents luck.
And you must not hastily make an operation that can do not more undo.
"That includes the children in the decision and eliminated they would do not right the fear that drives parents, because they are of the opinion," said they.
Ultimately the child decides the gender, which are better suited to him - and that's wonderful.
Children be enables in the situation, to make the decision himself.

Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The old man and the sea", Horst Janson is cut on the body.
Janson is himself an old hand in his profession, the art of acting.
None when fishing can do something before the old man Santiago.
So the two complement each other great.
You'd think almost the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the Fisher boy Manolo speaks, to be able to see.
When Santiago tired bent by life on the Chair, this is real at Janson.
Next to it is the role of the old Fisher through and through a Charakterrolle which excellent masters Janson.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and eventually wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is at long distances as the sole actor on the stage.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience, so that his monologues, no moment are boring.
His efforts finally to pull the fish, the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the Sea consists of only blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann can operate the old man in the boat before the fishing village.
During the performance, he sets the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, who sings with her songs and her beautiful voice of Cuba's attitude to life.
The four musicians playing Cuban rhythms to and are guests of the bar at the same time.

Looking for ice cream, which glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glow-in-the dark ice - using of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis himself took full advantage of the fluorescent properties of sea animals and created from it a luminous delicacy.
The idea came to him, after he had read a research paper about jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists artificially to produce the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, which raised the pH in the protein and the light thrown.
Chris explains the ice respond to the heat in the mouth and light - the more it licks, is the brighter it.
Charlie, the ice cream company's founders "lick me I'm delicious", says: "the product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and you get two grams for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the protein is heated by the mouth, the pH rises and lights up the ice.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it, because it has this wonderful glow on Halloween.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes good.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation to be more ambitious.
He says: "I want to develop like an invisible ice cream."
This is in and of itself impossible due to the refraction of light, caused by the ice crystals make up ice cream; but I suppose we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are artificially produced by Chinese scientists

She have "us with so many question marks provides, that the exclamation point missing to come seem to us".
Johanna Rahner says: "However, the key challenge remains the annoyance of death".
The question is related to that desire, "who dreams of being that at the end everything may be good".

Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which includes thousands of former Nortel patents filed an avalanche of claims of patent infringement against mobile phone maker on Thursday, including Google, the company, which was outbid by him at the bankruptcy auction by Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is community owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents concern technology that bring search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising in accordance to the lawsuit, which goes to the heart of Google's search engine business to.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC, and rock star were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make cell phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which is in sharp competition with Apple's mobile products and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid more than $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and most recently offered $ 4.4 billion.
After it was outbid by Rockstar for the Nortel patents, Google Motorola mobility acquired for $ 12.5 billion, a deal that was also motivated partly by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google, failed in his attempt to acquire the claim patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do this", so the complaint letter.
Rock Star calls a high compensation from Google, because it claimed that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.

Frankfurt park fees to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could be soon sensitive more expensive.
The magistrate of the city advises a template by traffic Department head Stefan Majer (Greens) today morning.
Therefore, the parking fees by 50 percent must be increased.
It should but not the prices increased, but shortens the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket vending machines from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
In December, then the Council must decide.
The retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers it "a good idea".
The parking directly in front of the shop was "a considerable advantage for smaller retailers".
The transport Club of Germany is of the opinion that an increase is "quite reasonable and actually long overdue" after two decades.
Public transport will be also more expensive.

Oil prices are further up on 96 USD per barrel
Oil prices fell further on Friday after worries about a high offer overshadowed a report, according to which the energy-hungry manufacturing sector of China's growing.
The places of reference crude oil for delivery in December had fallen by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
Offering large crude oil prices has charged in the past few weeks.
The Department of energy of the United States on Wednesday said the US offer was increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks increased the offer to 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of increased demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery of China's economy down, whose Wachstum had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after it had arrived in the previous quarter to the lowest level for two decades.

The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood well, but eventually it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the front passenger and back seat hunger is noticeable.
Clearly, the occasional cocktail or champagne may be responsible!
What obvious, as the drive to chilled to the next "drive-in", to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit, I'm happy with when it comes to fast food catching up late at night or early in the morning.
A few French fries, a coke and a burger - and then nothing like home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers making their presence felt.
For what must be a missing that throw his fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?
Discarded paper bags are mainly on the weekends along roadsides and in parking lots.
"Why?", I ask myself.
Are the people too stupid to take the bag home or until the next trash can?
It is not only so, that the paper stuff blighted the landscape.
Bags have obscured even transport facilities such as guard rails and thus triggered accidents.
Do we not think said "throwaway" about something but, she probably don't even know what this word actually means.
If you are in the evening more often, especially with several people in the car, you know how a rear bench can look through long nights: clothes, bottles and other trash Tower there.
Because some bags would make up more or less but also nothing – as opposed to the street, where nobody on the food remains of others want to trample.
I see already the day come, at which the clearing away is too stupid the cities and towns - and the fast food chains need to require deposit for their bags.

Dairy and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk, and milk products.
Made tofu with plants cream is, for example, a Quark replacement.
More mentions of the Vegetarier Bund to the Weltvegantag on 1 November.
The Vegetarier Bund Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives on 1 November on the occasion of the Weltvegantags:
Pure vegetable shortening is a good alternative to butter, yogurt let substitute soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oats, almond or rice milk can be used.
Folding plant cream replace traditional whipped cream.
Herbal alternatives to eggs.
A half mashed, ripe bananas for example can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams applesauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus 3 tablespoons water suitable for it.
Doughs are loose instead of egg for example with a mixture of one teaspoon of baking soda, one tablespoon of cornstarch and 3 tablespoons water.
But also 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silken tofu can serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu around 800 000 people eat currently in Germany vegan, so pure herbal.

A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a money source, to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box, which takes place in each car's dashboard.
The devices, which record every kilometres and report the information to the authorities, are core of a controversial attempt by Washington and planning offices of the Federal States to revise the obsolete system for the financing of American roads.
Suddenly, the usually rather boring field of road planning has reignited an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue, that the Government the small boxes to record mileage - and may also, where they went - use and can then use the information for the calculation of tax assessments.
The tea party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while it can be agreed in Congress not on a procedure several States no longer wait.
They are considering, as they can switch to a system over the next ten years to pay the driver per driven mile.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph, some with GPS monitoring of which are equipped.
This is really a must-have for our country.
"There is nothing that we may or may not use", said Hasan Ikhrata, Director of the Southern California Assn. of Government, is planning a recording of driven miles with all California motorists in the State from 2025.
The manner, as we pay these taxes, will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time as the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the taxes Americans pay at the pump is broke.
But in America much less fueled as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The State fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per liter) is not increased for 20 years.
Politicians in high fuel prices do not dare to raise the tax even by a penny.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His State has equipped recently 500 cars with tachograph, with which a mileage-based payment system to be tested.
"That represents the long term appropriate alternative", he said.
Bureaucrats describe it as a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the urban Liberals idea appeals, because the tax would, for example, to engage, to influence, that will reduce congestion and greenhouse gases driving.
The California designers put on the system in the development of strategies with which the ambitious statutory objectives of the State on climate change are to be achieved.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said that he saw in it the most viable long-term alternative.
Also the free marketers of the reason Foundation are the idea taken by travelled route pay driver.
"This is no tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President for policy at the reason.
People pay for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American Transport Ministers, who had urged the Congress in a report in 2011, to move toward mile-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project that would include 10,000 cars last year.
But the majority in the House of representatives prevented the advance and reacted to represent the concerns of members from rural areas, people who have to travel often many miles on the way to work or into the city everyday.
Several States and cities nonetheless move on your own in this direction.
Oregon, which is currently 5,000 riders for the biggest experiment of the country is the most dedicated.
These drivers will pay soon the mile instead of mineral oil tax to the State.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois tests it enshrined with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the ministries of transport of 17 States on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently, 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical at the thought of the Government could track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains directed Khan, head of the strategy and results management in the Ministry of transport of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
As the test went on, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its Web site: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in full-blown monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a series of States that now are looking for more affordable technology, with which the State can collect kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, so Khan, also the public would be reassured.
Hunting for this technology, some authorities has led to a small startup company called true mileage in California.
The company is not lined up originally to assist States in the taxation of motorists.
Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold, where drivers on the basis of driven miles to pay in an emerging market for insurance.
But the devices tested by her are interesting also for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, regularly be uploaded via a modem.
"People are more willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of true mileage.
Huge mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the designers experiment to give motorists a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee on the basis of miles driven by all the inhabitants of the State average.
Other authorities hope to be able to sell the concept of a wary public, by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device taxation pay can also park fees, insurance only for mileage must be paid with speed data collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to those drivers can Dodge congestion.
"Motorists would be motivated by the added value of the benefits provided by the system, to participate in", according to a planning document of the city.
However, some transport planners wonder whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge red herring.
With the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area who told officials, the Congress could San Francisco Bay Fund simply by increasing the fuel tax solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust.
An additional one-time fee or an annual tax could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation, if aspirin is also sufficient," explained Randy Rentschler, the Director of legislative and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do this, hundreds get millions of car drivers worried about their privacy and many other things.

Bad Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
The official opening ceremony for the art turf sports field despite the cold weather and rain lost nothing of significance for the city and the football club.
All were wanted last Saturday probably a pleasant ceremony, but Peter wanted to not play with it.
So those were looking up, which came without umbrella or not could keep such a reason.
That was the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as some speakers.
Wet, hence the FC Chairman Albrecht was Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks was all Mayor Walter Klumpp, who have strongly dedicated to the implementation of the project, the Municipal Council, the participating companies and Association members, who are brought up.
Here particularly Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioner moved 400 M² paving stones for the new routes.
Also the politician Karl Rombach paid tribute to this remarkable volunteer commitment.
Hubert Baier, the District Chairman of the Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning Office, which announced a donation to the youth section of the Club spoke more words of welcome for the urban Sports Committee.
Mayor Klumpp brought in memory, that recurring weather-related influences so used to the original pitch in spring and autumn, that he could not be played.
15 years ago, there was the first considerations to the solution of the problem, as was thought on the construction of a third place at the site of the football club or the Realschule at the Salt Lake.
Both was cancelled.
Six years ago, thoughts came to the laying of art turf athletic fields on what General considered the ultimate solution.

Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US monitoring
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. secret service, said he was ready to travel to Berlin and to testify before the German Bundestag, if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander give no answers about their activities.
On Thursday, the German Deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia, where it has received asylum, to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter from Snowden, who was presented on Friday by Ströbele media in Berlin, he writes: "even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my Government still treated a dissenting opinion as a betrayal and attempts to criminalize political speech with subpoena in which no defense is possible."
To tell the truth, but is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes, he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American Government to drop the charges against him.
The charges levied by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of Government property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told time online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk with German representatives then we find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained by the claims, the NSA heard the phone by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the secret service, said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, "without compromising him and to ruin relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied during his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Ströbele said that according to the law of the former NSA employee Snowden not could return to Russia, when he was leaving the country.
When Snowden in Germany say he needed an assurance that he was "safe", so the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he is exposed would be a "serious and continuous" campaign of persecution, have expelled him from his homeland.
He was however affected by the worldwide reaction to "my Act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians - even in the United States - have revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit at the public referred to.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation the German authorities, "If the difficulties related to the humanitarian situation have been resolved".

Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the Centre of Maputo, under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first President of Mozambique, to sing in a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"Again, we want peace, we want stability", Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company said.
Fearing for the future of the country, she has exchanged their business attire for a T-Shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on the independence square in the capital Thursday.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between forces of the Government and RENAMO, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
RENAMO was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the South African apartheid Government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent Government.
She became an opposition party after the peace treaty of 1992.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country again fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy the stakes are high, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the North West could investments of over $ 50 billion by companies such as Rio Tinto over the next years, Vale from Brazil, ENI of Italy and Anadarko of the United States in the country.
The ruling FRELIMO party, since 1975 the dominant force, and RENAMO give each other the blame for the tensions.
RENAMO claims the Government provoked the latest clashes, by she had attacked their members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October.
The assault on the former rebels escalated the leader of the group, as to kill Government troops RENAMO bases of attacked and attempted, Afonso Dhlakama, said Renamos spokesman told the financial times.
The Government blames RENAMO for the clashes and accused the Organization of assaulting soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday, Dhlakama to consider themselves as "Losers" who "wants to use all of his remaining powers, to prove that he can impose his decisions to the Government".
Both FRELIMO and RENAMO emphasize that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since the Mazanga was quoted as saying, RENAMO quit the peace agreement of 1992.
Compared with the FT, he explained that he meant that FRELIMO will no longer respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," Mazanga said.
Earlier talks between the political parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that were fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) heads collide," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and no one is ready to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated she will boycott the elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the Government.
Renamos electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party which will improve founded Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably in the elections by a former RENAMO member.
Mazanga claimed that Guebuza - pending his resignation when his second term ends next year - use of the democracy of the country would destroy.
"He wants no multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he wants no peace, because he wants to give up the Presidency", as Mazanga.
It is unclear what RENAMO capacity has, but it has taken restlessness-making attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connections.
The most fighting took place in the province of Sofala, lies some hundred kilometers north of Maputo, the but Beira port, mining companies like Rio Tinto is located in and Vale to the export of coal use.
In June, Rio interrupted for a month use of the railway, after RENAMO had announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga restrained answered the question whether RENAMO will repeat that threat.
Mazanga said RENAMO wanted to "the international community warn that things in Mozambique are not good".
The instability was the frustration with the Government still increased, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already due to corruption, the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the Government and the President for the future of the country and he should be the one who will find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar sultans, a protester, said people wanted just stability.
"No interested in RENAMO and FRELIMO, they want only back peace and usable roads," he said.

Children should get taught myths and legends as "Role models for life", an author says.
The stories of Thor showed that "Brutal force has no chance against clever tricks", and the Arthurian legend will demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths sure why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" developmentally appropriate works but "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools".
"I find it wonderful that America myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I have proposed that for twenty years as a plan.
He added that authors and teachers who were "overly didactic", would children "fully disconnect", because the messages would give in entertaining stories "subliminally".
Crossley-Holland, who has translated from the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf and author of the Penguin Book of Norse myths and the British folk tales is told: "you can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them as far as possible in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, is an author who writes for children, the need to give hope.
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the Happy ending, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented by the history be revealed and explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of tell.

Report: Obama campaign was considering to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have considered in secret, Vice President Joe Biden campaign 2012 by Hillary Clinton to replace, so the New York Times.
The revelation is the most surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the election of 2012, "double down: game change 2012".
A copy of the forthcoming book is the times and she reported on Thursday evening that the top Advisor to the President "extensive group meetings and surveys end of 2011" had carried out, to find out whether it is better look for Obama's dwindling hopes of re-election when he drop Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the times, the book traces thoroughly the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, notably of the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect it had on the poll numbers to replace the former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice President.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only a half-dozen of the closest advisors of the President - including Daley, the former Campaign Manager for Obama, Jim Messina, and the former Senior Adviser of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down", it is claimed, Daley had been at the forefront of the effort, despite their "close personal relationship" to replace Biden, before it eventually decided against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve the chances of Obama 's".
With Martin, Daley confirmed in an interview that the Government actually thought about, to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said a number of things you should take into consideration, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
One has to call in memory, that the President had at that time terrible poll numbers, so we thought: "For God's sake, what we do?"
While Daley described the investigation as "diligence", Martin compared to Anderson Cooper of CNN said that during the campaign for the re-election considerable expense had been operated, to find out whether such a move pay in terms of the polls.
"In campaigns not so much money on polls and focus groups will be issued, if not seriously thinking about something", said Martin on AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team through an exchange of thinking.
Martin told CNN, he asked Daley if his former boss about the potential change was mishandling.
Although Daley stated that he does not believe that the President of the possible change "was aware", the former Chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew it.
Martin added that "Double Down" give no definitive answer to the question whether the political investigation of Obama's desk would have achieved.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously think Obama knew nothing of the investigations about whether you should drop Biden in the elections.
"Possible", said Martin.

The Gemeindesäckl in herdwangen Saeed is well stocked and debt no longer knows the management since 2005.

Also the surplus of the administrative budget was around a million euros on the approach with approximately 1.8 million euros.
Thanks to the surplus was mainly higher tax revenues and the community share of the income tax.
Also the capital budget was again significantly above planned levels.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros he was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially at the higher feeder from the administrative budget, so Raj."
Because in the financial year 2012 less investment than planned have been made, higher was also the reserves.

Cry of despair a Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has taken commendable efforts had been thwarted by the Republican blocking tactics
The blockade policy excuse not the site problems by Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoir about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.
I'm currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book from which I thought it would cheer me up during the sombre second year of studying medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" (courage to win) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I am finished the evening with my patient records and go to bed, then the book leads me back at a time when politics inspired millions and could take your breath away for a talk.
The election was a landslide victory and newscaster stopped to make the historical significance of this hour before the eyes.
My classmates were weeping with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on his way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
As at 2008, Obama joined in the Office, he had ratings of 82%.
And then, I close the book.
On the present a rude awakening is to switch back, as if one is torn from a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be, a sad reminder of missed opportunities a vague memory.
Over the years, since I first made my voice, something has changed in fact.
But it's nothing that I could have imagined me easy.
I acknowledge the great and varied things that Obama has achieved, by the passage of the affordable care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Also I believe that the partisan blockade tactics have tipped too many efforts, with whom our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, just a few to mention.
But I've won numerous times the Obama administration's hostility towards colleagues and acquaintances, I'm arrived with my explanations at the end.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows eavesdropping on foreign heads of State, or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It can not explain why the national security agency to collect information about the private lives of Americans and the State misconduct disclose why punished the whistleblower.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor therefore be bypassed public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.
It justifies not the results of a report in which it says the efforts of the White House to the immobilization of the media to be the "most aggressive"... Since the Nixon administration.
And jüngstens it can excuse not an inability, to design a simple website care act in more than three years since the adoption of the affordable.
I don't know if it is what I would have expected.
I would have to understand with 18, that Government work could contradict the political campaigns preceding it.
Obviously members is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre dominate public discussion.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem largely by the Government to be chosen.
And that bothers me the most.
I got re-elected 2012 Obama, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not to be able to set its direction and positions.
I was under the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope, which we had long heard.
But with the fall in the ratings for Obama below 45% this week the return has become even harder in 2008 through this book.
It awakens the longing in me after many promises, which dissolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama suffered a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election officials after the decision, he said his staff they would have to get back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want that we find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not be more agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.

Josef Winkler writes the hardships of his childhood and youth of the soul itself for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village of childhood - the silence, the penchant for brute force and blunt sexuality, the close and Cheerlessness -.
The Büchner Prize above all as a prose writer, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher puts together for his performance of "Lightning on the tip of the tongue", which now can be seen in the garage X in St. Peter's square, therefore a collage of prose texts.
The theatre-maker combines about elements of strong autobiographical novel "The SERF" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Corpse, his family belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty cleared stage – important requisite: A zerknautschtes sofa, on the hint copulating and will masturbates - shimmy up the eight-member ensemble through the text material.
While Director Fresacher seems little to trust the text.
The 70-minute performance glossed over the template with an abundance of directed raids, known from the Repertoire of post dramatic forms of play.
Above all the actresses come in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic conversions.
You will be hard drawn, dipped his head under water, scrawled with their evening gowns on the wall.
Wedged in cellophane or bodice, they teeter on dangerously high Stöckeln through the staging, she monologisieren loudly or are completely silent on the stage floor.
The text conveys hardly thus sought.
The evening when Sung has the best moments - range up to popular songs by deep purple.
Towards the end of the wacky performance is something to rest, and Winkler's almost absurd humor flashes.
