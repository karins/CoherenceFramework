		<seg id="3">The letter, according to a translation by Stroebele used the following wording:</seg>
		<seg id="4">To the people in charge</seg>
		<seg id="5">I was asked to write to you about your investigation to mass surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was used by contract or a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In the course of my employment in these institutions witnessed systematic violations of my government that led me from a moral duty to act.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw I was exposed to a serious and persistent agitation that forced me to leave my family and my country.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have the revelations to a system of mass surveillance that is accountable to nobody, as does a public service.</seg>
		<seg id="12">These spy revelations, many proposals for new laws and directives, justified by the formerly concealed abuse of public trust.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The benefits to society from the knowledge gained is becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, reduces the risks taken on board.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Although evidence was the result of my efforts, my government treated dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalise political expression and to put on trial.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Still, there is no crime to speak the truth.</seg>
		<seg id="16">I am confident that will give the government of the United States with the support of the international community this prejudicial attitude.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I hope that, if resolved the difficulties of this humanitarian situation, will be able to good clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, especially in terms of truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and gesetzesgemaeß.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Traveling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care</seg>
		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">You are here or with your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 &quot;CNN Heroes of 2013.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 in order to turn it into the &quot;CNN Hero of the Year&quot; to choose.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The winner receives $250,000 to continue its work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched on as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was founded in 1981 in a car accident near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, injured.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First, he had a broken arm, but it was an inflammation of the brain, and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not easy,&quot; Bwelle commented.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can leave the house at five o &quot;clock in the morning and go to the hospital to be the first, and is not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are very many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some people even die because they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">On the other hand, the ratio in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But even if it were a doctor, could afford most Cameroonians to visit.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of health spending in the country are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">His father and to see so many of his countrymen suffer ripened in Bwelle decided to do something about it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 operations last year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, who travels on weekends in rural areas, and it offers free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the helpless medical equipment on the roof of unprerpared terrain in the villages who need help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
		<seg id="32">More than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages is free medical care is a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - is the joyous celebration.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team begins with the examination of hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We are treating 500 people per trip,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="37">You come from a 60 mile radius of the village - and on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these weekend clinics provide medical care in a number of areas.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are due to malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Other crutches donated glasses or receive free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening, the team simply operations with local anaesthetic.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations are normally held in a school, town house or an apartment, after the procedure, patients on and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The lighting for the surgery and the Desinfektions equipment is powered by the generator of the group and Bwelle and its volunteers are working until the early hours on Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is a very exhausting work, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They drum throughout the night, so that we remain awake and continue our work,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students know last year - has carried out 700 operations and that they had to work a huge difference for the people it helps.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One man said that the free operation RAEC Mons, which he had received, he is allowed to return to work.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;That changed the future of my family,&quot; said the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital works Bwelle at night in private clinics in Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">With this second job finance 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I really do not know when he is asleep,&quot; says Katie O &quot;Malley, who for the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily participates in Bwelles group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">It is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For medical and nursing students such as O &quot;Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience they would never get at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We can be in operations, where we help, blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; explains O &quot;Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">That would be in America as a medical student in the second year will never be possible.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The students typically pay for their trip to Cameroon and bring often donated medical equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="58">However, they are in Yaounde, Bwelle accommodation, transportation and guide.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is without doubt a hero,&quot; says O &quot;Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He devotes his life to this organization and its desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no borders.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bwelle is the almost constant work, not a burden.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Others to give to a happier life and a promise that he made his father, he is a great pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I make this work,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I am thinking of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I do it to get people to laugh and to alleviate the pain.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will for the first time on February 22, appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Cardinals are the senior clerics in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are the ones who choose a Pope Francis, in order to nominate the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are currently 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80, no longer participate in the pope's election, a group of 120 &quot;cardinals&quot; to voters.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In a statement in which the news was known, said Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, it will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, who is also known as a consistory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis has decided to give its decision in February to convene the projects run by known in advance, so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world, can be planned,&quot; said Lombardi.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero, from Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will be dropped until February.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He explained that a pope usually take as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of voting cardinals in 120, and so many cardinals over the age of 80, as he wants.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The consistory next year is so important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Currently, there is some overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Forty% of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council, founded by Francis to cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Francis has selected these eight cardinals who will help him,&quot; Valero said.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He explained that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that would ask Francis to cardinals for advice.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said that the bishops would typically refer to great places to Cardinals, but Francis was &quot;full of surprises - so we do not know whom he appoints.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">Europe's elite is willing to do business with the United Kingdom?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for wealth and work in Britain, want to change our relations with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To this end, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders in the British company sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results of the survey will surprise many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focuses on countries that modernize and grow, while the states are stagnant in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Do you wish the government new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil are promoted, instead of the long and exhausting process of reforming the arcane EU institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Asked about their views on specific legal issues - from the antitrust law to the product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, because according to the company's benefits outweigh the costs of Brussels regulations has to be part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies, which are traditionally the most Europhile.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a significant majority of Great Britain a course towards the revision of the agreement, and a relationship with the EU, which is based on commerce, not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This realization that is used in businesses of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is in a &quot;meaningful change&quot; that brings back to the United Kingdom.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is about much - a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would be at 16 percent, a change of view in favor of the agreement of the EU in a referendum.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The prime minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy stands behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK's conditions for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that companies expect from a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving toward closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey, which means for companies to pay more attention to trade and a fundamental change in the approach to rules in Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower's former employees, began with the publication of its topics U.S. surveillance Geheimnissen, European governments and corporate executives are more sure if they can take the director at his word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and data acquired American cloud provider, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company's paranoia about government surveillance to a new peak.</seg>

		<seg id="22">Nevertheless, the scope and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations shocked firms that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Australian government insists on the tough conditions that are associated with the bailout package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government can spend the money.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take &quot;immediate measures&quot; to avert a crisis that was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The funding for a period of four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government has put together a contingency rescue package that is in our view, the unique challenges facing the state,&quot; Plibersek said today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This includes $325 million emergency aid package of $31 million for electoral services.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Through another 2600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for eye cataracts, residues should be eliminated.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Moreover, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments are the ideas that the clinic staff told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,&quot; said Tanya Plibersek.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A pioneer Commission will set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Wilkie said today that the $325 million would benefit little, if &quot;they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable rate.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless, he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for emergency aid, which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system in the state of the list of concerns,&quot; said Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the state government will be able to make up this election provided most of the recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a &quot;Band-Aid solution.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;We are in today's situation, because the Labor state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system,&quot; he said on ABC TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It cannot be that a state government almost half a billion dollars from the system, and the Commonwealth of 300 million, and then pretend that is the good news.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Dutton Plibersek urged to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="3">The judge had ruled in August that the city would offend the Constitution with the way the programme will be implemented for stopping and questioning people.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city appealed against their judgment and ordered corrective measures, including the decision to set up a supervisory body that should support the police in changing the directive and the corresponding training program.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Court of Appeal on Tuesday heard the arguments of the suspension.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The report, the judge declared appeal should be relieved from the case because they have violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by is that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly due to a series of media interviews and public statements, in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Survivors and relatives of the 202, 2002 people who were killed in the bombing in Bali, were angered by the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was brought to justice, as Umar Patek, in their view, should be shot without allowing them.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most sought-after people in Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to 20 years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="3">With the suspension, he could be released after 15 years.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, have been injured and many more.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A guilty verdict was also in a number of terrorismusbezogener charges, which included a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, even if it is the man who, because of his reputation as a wordless bomb maker known as &quot;Demolition Man,&quot; could have requested the death penalty.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision has aroused painful memories in June Cort Een, a mother from Perth, which lost its 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the Patek and his Mitverschwoerern devastation caused almost ten years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Fighting back tears, she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;We should put him in front of a firing squad,&quot; said Cort Een to AAP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I have to live with every day that I will not get another grandson and I will never see my daughters.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Sari Club has been razed to the ground, and exploded on 12 October 2002, shortly after 23 pm a huge bomb in a small truck that was parked in front of the nightclub.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber exploding a backpack filled with explosives.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and &quot;died&quot; thrice, while he was on a life support system.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hughes said that Patek have deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samu Dra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Really, this guy should have before any other to the death penalty.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
		<seg id="18">To get in 20 years after he killed 202 people and many hundreds injured, is not much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He eluded almost a decade after the arrest, but was picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces nearly four months later, the former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden killed.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the negotiation of a FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the reference that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;He has not arisen,&quot; said Cort Een.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has inflicted on other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The verdict came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which will be celebrated with commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;There will be many tears this year,&quot; said Cort Een.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Canadian plane and train manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15 percent decline in net profit, after he was advised by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bombardier, based in Montreal, a flight test data for his brand-new aircraft of the contract and gave no new information about whether the plane could go according to the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The maiden flight of the test aircraft so far, only three other launches were followed by a year and a half months, which makes it doubtful whether the testing phase is proceeding as planned.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of &quot;outperform&quot; from &quot;sector perform&quot; in view of the fact that the shares in the next one to two quarters a limited rate potential.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Even though there are fewer delivery figures for aircraft detection, but clearly we are disappointed by the margins of development in the transport sector,&quot; Doerksen said in a client note.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the contract, if the test program is progressing for the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But if there are no new orders in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the aircraft of the contract can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test aircraft was presented in March after months of delays and flew to the public for the first time in September.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But so far are binding orders for the contract with 177 moderate, because potential buyers want to wait and see the results of the flight tests whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new Duesen transport aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">CEO Pierre Beaudoin, Bombardier is confident that it will achieve its goal of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Corporate governance also assured on Thursday with analysts and media, the program is in the schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test plane is no longer expected to remain on the ground,&quot; Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that during the life of the aircraft had been scheduled soil tests and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Each manufacturer is different.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We have decided to take a first flight and attach an Ueberarbeitungs period, what we have done.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This is happening throughout the flight program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, it said on the part of companies.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, analysts remain skeptical that it can take twelve months after the maiden flight of a plane's first customer of the contract.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said that it checked the planning for the start-up (EIS) and will update this in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015,&quot; Doerksen said.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter with the end of September 30 Bombardiers net profit to $147 million, or 8 cents per share fell by $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The adjusted earnings per share was unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Sales slipped slightly, and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected a gain of 10 cents per share, and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Net orders fell by 83 to 26.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The order book in the aerospace division was on September 30, 32.9 billion dollars and was unchanged compared with December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and market relations as a whole were disappointing,&quot; said Beaudoin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Sales in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area has risen by nearly eleven percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The order book in the transport sector, on September 30, 32.6 billion dollars and was increased to 31 December.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The profit margin in the field of transport has been hampered by Abwicklungs problems on some large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier shares by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that it will also change the Google CFO Patrick Pich, to the Board.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists have been able to throw more light on what the relationship is with the capable of creatively organizing his mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail stretched out to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while it was in nervous dogs the left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other dogs these subtle differences can perceive and respond to it.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vall Orti Gara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;In humans, is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we have tried to look at this in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He also pointed out that in dogs as in humans, the right brain hemisphere is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs respond to the side of their tail, the researchers monitored the animals, while others saw these movies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured heart rate of dogs and analyzed the behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Soon we are likely to understand why the tail in the first, in the other direction</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vall Orti said: &quot;We have shown the Gara dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">If the animals saw how an otherwise ausdrucksloser dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they are able to relax completely.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But it was left to the tail of the dog that wags perspective (again), increased their heart rate and they saw restless.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Professor Vall Orti Gara deliberately the dogs do not communicate with each other by these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, what movements they should not be worried, and when.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He said: &quot;When it comes to encounters with other dogs and is the perfect place with the tail in a direction more with friendly behavior and produces the right-hand page is a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of this experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right for dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada was as follows: &quot;Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog that wags his tail&quot; of left and right, rather than in the Italian study to be restless - precisely the other way around. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to his testimony could stir the differences so that interpretations of the dogs in the various studies of animals in films or the robot dogs and dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still must be determined and dogs are no exception,&quot; said Bradshaw.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Because of their behavior, but simply record will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes in one direction, sometimes the other.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In the work of HS2 Ltd is proposed, with the start of Phase 1 in 2026 high-speed rail links between Scotland and the north of England.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Transport Minister Baroness Kramer, said the project &quot;will bring Britain closer together.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">After the completion of phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail line between London and northern England by £32.7 billion to 42.6 billion pounds.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, HS2 Ltd, asked for more routes and travel time improvements in northern England and Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">These include the possibility of an eventual travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network, which brings together Britain and its cities.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">We are moving ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Without it, we are facing a Kapazitaets crisis in our network.</seg>

		<seg id="15">Mr Brown said: &quot;The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also the economic power of Scotland at the same time provides an argument for high-speed rail links across Great Britain.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">In fact, Waltraud Ries.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Their house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart, an old trees, friendly neighbors and not too much traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;They have hopefully not afraid of spiders?&quot; Asks Waltraud, and shows a big spider on door frames.</seg>
		<seg id="5">I am looking for some time now, a new apartment for my husband and me.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The reason is, however, no spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many stairs to the house and not being able to accomplish in the apartment, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Moreover, since a meniscus operation has experienced the Mittfuenfzigerin first-hand what it means to move with a handicap from floor to floor.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Recently, she published a book on the subject of happiness in the age - What residential form is the best for me? .&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Our apartment is the best example of what is not aged at all,&quot; she starts to tell.</seg>
		<seg id="11">More than 20 years ago, when she moved with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the Greens.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Today, with Waltraud Ries in mid-fifty, thinks differently.</seg>
		<seg id="13">They also know that it is one of the few people who, with the theme &quot;living in old age.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Most of it, as long as it is.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Old buildings are always only the other, &quot;she says humorous.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Only when the suffering, do you really think.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;Then it can be a bit too late,&quot; said Ries.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined lifestyle in old age.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;What a living form, however, is always an individual choice,&quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="20">D i e solution is not for old age.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Even those who could afford the residency in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could be ill.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And: &quot;Without good knowledge of the language vereinsame in Dolce Vita,&quot; warns the book Autorin Aussiedlung Willi gene.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Among their models are classic forms of childcare models, alternative housing or the oft-quoted pensioners - WG.</seg>
		<seg id="24">At the age of each of his ticks and quirks</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;For me it would be nothing but a residential community,&quot; she says with a wink.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Certainly not like in a student house with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;In the age simply takes its retreat,&quot; said Ries.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A senior residential community that can work, however, do not want to exclude the book author.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But then it must be different from the classic students - WG.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And sometimes you just want only his rest, &quot;she believed.</seg>
		<seg id="31">She is hardly alone, at least in the state capital.</seg>
		<seg id="32">&quot;The majority of old people in Stuttgart will remain as long as it is in their own apartment,&quot; is also the experience of Theresa Ruetten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the provincial capital.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The department advises people about &quot;age.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">So often, elderly people would just take inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment buildings.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Ries recommends that all those who deal with this conversion of their house or an apartment to find out not only to hire the best craftsmen.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Today, there are specialists for this transformation.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Even in the rental apartment will be realized one or the other, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, clarifies the interior designer.</seg>
		<seg id="39">But not always, reconstruct the existing flat age and thus accessible, even if it is still as beautiful.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.</seg>
		<seg id="41">While you could install a stair lift, which is also in the apartment with a cobblestone path to the door, but the far greater obstacle.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It will proceed until it has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Before the parade will hate it more than before the spider on their front door.</seg>

		<seg id="9">Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to gain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.</seg>

		<seg id="26">The relationship is not simply that of a drug Haendlers, but a drug Haendlers who supplied his lawyer with drugs.</seg>

		<seg id="33">But after the hearing superintendent Lee Halstead said: &quot;Mr processed by the police in Lancashire has taken the step of a criminal defendant to a criminal when he began to acquire drugs by organized criminals.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;The deers&quot; transition to the extensive rebuilding in order to improve road safety?</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yes, local councils have decided.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Schiltach, for 220,000 euros.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Deutsche Bahn wants to improve next year, has brought forward the rail route.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In particular, to increase the safety of railroad crossings - it is regularly nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The rebuilding of the communities, they must participate with one third of the cost, the rest share and covenant.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Schilt Achs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council on the specifics of the Bahuebergangs &quot;deer.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">There, the city plans to build the tunnel in Mundes west of the railway tracks a bulge.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There may be bigger cars, for example, those carrying logs, are at oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Grießhaber proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could widen the street from time to time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This was discussed in the municipal council is controversial because some councillors questioning the need for road expansion: Thomas Kipp, the mood of the critics, saying: &quot;We have to take so much money for so few vehicles in the hand?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing &quot;deer&quot; will be used regularly for long wooden Transporte.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Even wood from the area, in part, &quot;Kuhbach&quot; will be transported via this route because they could not use the vehicles up to 20 metres the track at the Haeberle bridge, because they could not turn to the main street.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Moreover, the line serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is clear that Kirch would have to be rebuilt and renovated mountain and Schlossberg tunnel, as is currently the case, the Wolf River &quot;on&quot; deer &quot;also have an important traffic for a longer period.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The council agreed to investigate what's intended enlargement costs would cause the street.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Regardless of the reconstruction of the railway was agreed by a majority of transition with the proviso that the retaining wall is being built so that the city's subsequent road towards &quot;Bahnhofstrasse&quot; for meeting traffic could eventually expand to around 5.5 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The renovation of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein may have a different problem, the access to the steeply rising &quot;Geroltzhaeuser path&quot; concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The administration had to examine the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger, because she had doubts about whether the planned end of the Geroltzhaeuser way then possible.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The investigation concluded that it is not excluded that the tilt of the street could lead to &quot;prolonged vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The responsibility for this, in turn, enter the city as a Straßenbaulasttraegerin.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The disputes could drag the liability.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Because both worked wood collection and turning in the current state of development, should they not agree to the reconstruction of the rail crossing, Haas argued.</seg>
		<seg id="24">At this point is also the risk of a collision of turn with a vehicle in the transition to much lower than in the other crossings, because is the next stop in the middle, which is a good view.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even the streets, even at this point would have to be slowed down as far as that of a collision.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The reconstruction of this train, because the city's consent has been denied by the majority of the problem with aufsitzenden Schiltach vehicles &quot;would have to pay,&quot; said the councils, which could withdraw the train after the construction of the responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The Panel considers as problematic the conversions of the crossings &quot;in Heubach&quot; and &quot;Kuhbach,&quot; Kreuzungs agreements already made for the train.</seg>

		<seg id="1">You could say that is New York City the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago began the Variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Starboys at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Over the years, innovation has been very pretty, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Founded and headed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carol Ines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and theaters.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Most of these began with Carol's headliner, and were always successful, until it became too well known to act in a club,&quot; said Hirsch.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At this year's event, there are appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and &quot;Stand Up for Heroes,&quot; an annual music and comedy fundraising event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, which, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Anderson.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The festival has grown in the world of comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year, have become known in more unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom in the cable television (the irony - &amp; nbsp; raunchy fantasy football series &quot;the League&quot; on MC12) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Jenny Slate was both &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;parks and Recreation&quot; part of the occupation, although best known for their viral video series &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, pessimistic view on racial issues, W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One of the biggest magnets for visitors of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, has developed into a reputable television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>
		<seg id="14">From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television program entitled &quot;Sit Down Comedy With David Steinberg&quot; in TV land.</seg>

		<seg id="16">&quot;The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work,&quot; Steinberg said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, supposedly &quot;phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World in May 2005, heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his &quot;special adviser&quot; Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlbys voice mails, and they followed, but Coulson also called and left messages, such as the court was told.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;According to the prosecutor, Coulson, who is now publisher of the NotW, no one is above the apartment of people and hopes to catch them red-handed, but one that faced with a history of people like to see their reaction,&quot; said Edis.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He said NotW use three methods to investigate stories citizen investigators: Phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The publisher is personally involved in the third method.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Obviously he knows from the second, the surveillance, it cannot be changed.</seg>
		<seg id="8">What about the first?</seg>
		<seg id="9">He knows about the phone hacking?</seg>
		<seg id="10">He continues to deny this, but we say: &quot;And if he knew about it.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">Clarke's rumours of an affair were first taken up by the feature editors of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: &quot;Do not waste your time, it is with Charles.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">A band with voice mail from their phone has been secured by at least three occasions in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, Pawlby and her sister as &quot;projects&quot; were saved.</seg>
		<seg id="14">When the research, the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby.</seg>
		<seg id="16">On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a voice mail with the following content: &quot;I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, I would like to speak with Charles.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">Edis said, followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett Coulsons activities in this story.</seg>
		<seg id="18">On Thursday, the jury heard that Coulson Blunkett was confronted with an affair with a married woman, when he was stable even with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Coulson and Brooks argue that to have conspired with others, between October 3, 2000 and 9. August 2006 to hack phones.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: Up Fast</seg>
		<seg id="1">African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be more likely than their white age mates whom studies show.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes do not mean immediately puberty</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe the epidemic of obesity is a trigger for early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend of early puberty is less pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A mother should be worried if her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Medical Association children this week in Orlando, Florida, declared the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes among American girls are relatively normal and a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - normally there is no indication that now the puberty,&quot; Kaplowitz said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, shame and Achsel hair and body odor, among girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the onset of first menstruation) in the last 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;If the development of breasts, it takes at least two to three years to menarche,&quot; Kaplowitz said, also author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this problem often encountered.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test of how the pace of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is a controversial issue, which is indeed the beginning of puberty, but it is &quot;precocious,&quot; if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt at the age of eight years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, slowing down the process or - something that can monitor a pediatrician.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For faster progress could be shown by an Endikronologen tests in order to prevent serious problems like tumors or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bone that can ultimately lead to growth and thus Hemmung small body size in adults.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is reticent about drugs, but he admits: &quot;The suppression of puberty can lessen behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different than their age.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want to see her very young daughters of the period.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They are worried about the Schwangerschafts risk or how they handle hygienic side,&quot; Kaplowitz said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter was with her in ten days.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, they were not prepared emotionally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She was scared and excited by the school home because she was the first in their circle of friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Young girls are similar to those used in puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He supported a study of the 2001 girls aged six to nine, which establishes a connection between body fat and the transition to adolescence.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be more likely than their white peers.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are different explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Global seems influenced by all sorts of things to be an early adolescence, from economic conditions on the climate to the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another conundrum: Although a growing boy's face and pubic hairs earlier, the trend is not so strong as to a full earlier puberty in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors on the Piezon ® - Conference stressed the complexity of the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even among babies and young children.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician, how they should talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;This may mean that you must hold a meeting sooner than expected,&quot; advised Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you stay calm, normally the child responded well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls who bloom early, need the insurance, which is a normal part of life, even if it happens earlier than thought.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Two YMCA staff members from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 charges have been levelled against the children, Jonathan Lord, Caring Bah, told the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But at the opening statement before the Commission of the YMCA, said it was &quot;never in the organization had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Managing director Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employees had been accused of any wrongdoing with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caring Bah Hall 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him had been condemned.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer that he knew from the first case, but did not know the second.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA of the Commission was also inaccurate in saying, &quot;there was external inspections of the YMCA, which was recognised by the YMCA as a frontline in the children's safety.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second lowest score of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) has received in August of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management of the &quot;failed&quot; by me in the recruitment of Lord and do not ensure that employees are aware of their obligations to report violations of the rules on child safety.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offenses involving twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had held a cultural problem and the employees to report violations of the Lords regarding the safety of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The employees testified that they had observed violations, among other things, that was Lord alone with children, they privately as a babysitter, she was sitting on his lap, said that he was a loving, and children playing with his cell phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, whose boss Lord was and had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was worried for his behavior, said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat, who was in the YMCA Caring Bah, the Lords, &quot;was very daunting and very remote to most of the time.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Managing Director has stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not dare to report to their superiors.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Instead, he said, it has affected their friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they have not reported.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hare explained that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organization from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident,&quot; said, &quot;this&quot; was not by employees, and the board voted to approve him.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kere Van: European unbundling gives the Scots the election</seg>
		<seg id="1">A new day, a new Schreckens history of independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This is the key word for stories of passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the Hadrian's Walls.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, it was pointed out in the template forming on the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was - as expected - in the headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">No one even mentioned that the EU member states often bent their strict rules, if it is more advantageous to them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Since Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">That is not really a story.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And one that has occurred in the years that it already looks like a fossil: The first time I used the &quot;independence means passport controls at least 40 years ago,&quot; duck heard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is an interesting point in the continuous replay of this ancient history.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should you expect from an independent Scotland that it is at the European pipe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why the London exchange against the yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">These are the real European news: The large, adopted after the war plan for the unification of Europe is stalled.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the euro crisis the European project is dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Parties are gaining ground everywhere in the EU, are hostile to the EU - or want to have the euro as their common currency.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany - until this year - almost five million votes in the federal election in September, and thus effectively for the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The current economic crisis, as a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket into which is forced the national economy by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments will cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial to German exporters and the German politicians would want to leave.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency is southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only way is to cut public spending and wages - spurred by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the current budget and monetary problems, a deeper European productivity problem.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of the &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and gas fourfold.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All the world does not reward hard Schreibungen protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into a corner by cheap American shale gas.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the EU saw France's political elite as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and could keep Paris on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Paris and Berlin does not need more than gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has put its own economic policy, which the struggling French economy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing National Front, hostile to the EU has just won a crucial by-election and the ruling Socialists in three.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it can expect a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working-class French?</seg>
		<seg id="33">They want to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti- common currency bloc in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and that is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is the point I want to: In the not-so-distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency, to the abolition of the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it is more like the &quot;Europe of the (sovereign) nations, the General de Gaulle preferred.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that Great Britain distanced itself from this project in the hope of cosying up to the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Where does Scotland in all this?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can determine a region by (ultimately) to be small - England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests - including Brussels, Berlin and say what they want to hinstecken.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland could run a looser European union quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should consider that Norway do well and maintain our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has 2011 spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and) cuts made by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to impose an austerity policy in Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no cell phone conversations)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Passengers can now from departure to landing their electronic devices to read, listen to music, games, activities and use the prestige of films, but not with your mobile phone, according to the new guidelines, which on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published in the US.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that these changes be implemented immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How fast they were implemented, would depend on the respective airline, Michael Huerta, FAA employees at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The FAA, the airlines must demonstrate that aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew, as well as the rules for the storage of the devices under the new rules.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said that she had already received plans by some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Under these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the plane doors are closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">You can start only once the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain the go-ahead.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the entrance to the runway, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again until the plane landed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the new guidelines could airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference, the devices also allow its passengers to start, landing and use on the tarmac, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most new airliners and other planes that were adapted for the use of Wi-Fi in larger amounts, should meet the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;If the new regulation is implemented, and we are working closely with the airline about this together - will benefit both sides,&quot; commented Glading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Frankly, we are sorry to have to feel on this subject as watchdogs.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the agency explained.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers will be asked to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Words With Friends,&quot; is still not online, the Scrabble game that played the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he is an American Airlines jet had to leave because he refused to switch the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices like laptops should continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In-flight cell phone conversations are also banned.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The regulatory authority for phone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA lifts ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing may be</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, said Mark Rosen of the Transportation Security Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, an expert on national transportation issues at CBS News, cellphones would still be considered as a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that can disrupt the transfer stations,&quot; said Rosen, also from the air.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, suggested last month that the government will permit a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, as critics represented the view that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions are more difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In some studies say that up to a third of the passengers are missing or ignored the closure of the unit.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travelers had become, after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment brought in by passengers VHF radios that were then the latest technology trend.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that comprise them electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the flight is reached.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The Wi-Fi systems, pilots are also less susceptible to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations.</seg>
		<seg id="36">E-mail reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if umblaettert.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But when it comes to downloading or sending data transmission values are stronger.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the devices used by passengers is Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">2011 firm employees invited an airliner full of Kindle e-book reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could find none.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd said the passenger association, National Association of Airline Passengers that he believes that the distraction of the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who did speak for a malfunction of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to land in poor visibility conditions instruments in the closure of the devices by the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing them as a proper adjustment for travelers who extensively today would be equipped with technology.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that there is not a pleasant experience at odds with the safety of passengers,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="5">A river area investigation had been given with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the Hochwasser protection concept in Gechingen.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The protection of cultivated land is the goal,&quot; says Häußler.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Jumbo manufacturers are arguing in the face of large orders on seat width</seg>
		<seg id="1">Between leading aircraft manufacturers has given rise to an argument about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers during long flights in economy class - not always the ones to make airlines, but most of these designated areas is the key to efficiency claims with the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for an industry standard that a seat width of 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, says the American rivalry between Boeing, the airlines should decide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell bigger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and at the event from 17th to 21th November expect record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">What is the structure of the rear of the aircraft - especially if there are nine or ten rows of seats - is crucial to the economic results that the new &quot;mini Jumbo&quot; is supposed to provide.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing claims its new &quot;777 X&quot; will be 406 people in seats in economy class, about 17 inches wide, and ten per series.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 astutely 350 persons in 18 -inch wide seats in economy class, where there are nine per series.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertising in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Airbus now calls before the Dubai Airshow, which will make the 777 X with more than 100 orders for the race, directly to the public.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The company recently unveiled an ad that the beginning of a new ad war, donors could and showed a picture, in which three people are squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: &quot;Would you accept that?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo props,&quot; says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">People with different dietary habits are thicker, but plane seats have not changed radically.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, and the end of the century defined the modern long-haul travel has increased the weight of the average American males between 40 and 49 years by ten percent, according to the data of the U.S. health ministry.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21th century, according to U.S. health statistics 100.8 cm.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept in the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized &quot;jet set&quot; was narrow.</seg>
		<seg id="16">We have, Airbus, investigations that documented that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat will sleep quality by 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputed Airbus says the numbers on the seat Maßen and that it is not up to the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between flight tariffs and establishment.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The company also stated that the experience in the aircraft, according to research by more than the seat width.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It is really intended to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful,&quot; says the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">You know your business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers is about more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the confrontation is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the export performance of the U.S. or Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the Sitzlayout the driving force behind the battle for new jets.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing are 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365 -seater Boeing 77 - 300 ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the 777 X is compared with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently with ten seats per row.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Boeing squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products,&quot; says Kevin Keniston, director for passenger comfort in the European Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row in the 777s indicated that many passengers have opted for closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper airline fares.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Eighteen inches of legroom would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view from the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777,&quot; said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin interior, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which to select the airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The world-travelling jet salesman with a tape measure even contribute to the establishment of the competition and gherkins.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Even if they extol the convenience, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but sold by his own account, not yet.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for greater adaptability of the cabin and offered some jets wide seats on the corridors.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets that experts say will evaporate the call for a new industry standard, but probably could distract from the wave of 777 X - sales.</seg>

		<seg id="0">According to the lexicons of veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism, but this is different in a significant way.</seg>
		<seg id="1">While vegetarians, eating ice cream cake, or a powerful Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Vega's.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the waiver of meat and fish, the vegans from all consumption of animal products - including honey is denied.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What, one might wonder, but a closer look at the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable resourcefulness.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Sandwich spreads are very popular,&quot; says Ute Henkel, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He eventually won a vegan for 13 years, he finds M100 (almost) everything that he needs to live. &quot;1997 I asked my diet, and was a vegetarian.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">Around the turn of the century, then the next step and I was vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe,&quot; says Proctor, who prefers leather and artificial leather.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He recognized that it is also in other everyday matters without animal products.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is primarily a vegan ethics.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I do not want that animals have to die for me,&quot; says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, who covers the entire consumer behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Instead of burgers, hinterherzutrauern scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegans quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm went up.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;It is a double bonus today,&quot; says Proctor, &quot;indeed, his vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset.&quot; The assumption that the one with the diet, the selection of dining options, Proctor more on the power of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">These conditions would also fail, and some even well-intentioned attempt.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The addiction is a crucial factor that many can be quickly abandoned, like smoking,&quot; Proctor, a comparison.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A: &quot;Certain tastes and are not in the animal.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;You can also produce the same effect in other ways,&quot; explains the vegans.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Proctor brings to a barbecue, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Vegan Wuerste.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is a balanced, varied diet, it should also taste to eat again.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Of course, if you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;It is supposed to taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Health to eating disorders, a more widespread adoption, he does not have suffered.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The change was a positive aspect for me.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I take no foreign cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;I am checking myself, my blood values are often,&quot; Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Especially against the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus, critics warn.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;When animals are fed with feed, rather than graze on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat that you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 - share high,&quot; Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;My B12 - values are in order,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Proctor must not go long distances for food procurement.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and now every supermarket has soy milk and other products.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Everything I need, I think.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Only once in a while I buy something special.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Many people overlooked that only the finished products are expensive, but it is also known as&quot; ordinary &quot;finished products.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="37">It is much cheaper and less time-consuming to prepare vegan meals than is commonly believed.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;There is a lot to explore in the home kitchen, with a few little tips can be good, if not achieve better results,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor was able to bring his in-laws.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Family celebrations gives the vegans a new seasoning.</seg>
		<seg id="41">This is dynamic, if combined, has a new role.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;The situations that can arise in the process are as different as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But, of course, he was shown skepticism.</seg>
		<seg id="44">You do not taste my food?</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;I feel bad because I drank milk?&quot; - On such issues as vegans must act with sensitivity.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;I do not reject people, yes, I am part of this society,&quot; Proctor would live no Enklaven existence.</seg>
		<seg id="47">And, more specifically, the everyday world seems so veganfremd as limited and not sufficient vigour of vegans are all in everyday life.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The fast food is allowed.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Chips are everywhere!</seg>
		<seg id="50">&quot;Many Döner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; Proctor says.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In a pizzeria he differs on pasta dishes, or simply ordered a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="52">The restaurants are so slow.</seg>
		<seg id="53">&quot;When I started 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult for me to eat vegan,&quot; the New Zealanders, a development that: &quot;You must talk to the people who make it to their attention.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="54">&quot;If enough demand, they are perhaps inclined to complement the menu,&quot; he hopes.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or café bird free.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Proctor is the desire that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Essentially, vegan dishes for everyone.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Everyone can eat them, they are exactly the opposite of that.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Meat dishes are exclusively, in the truest sense of the word, because they preclude others from,&quot; Proctor said.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safer way to make it impossible for the most part in the first place,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="61">Purchasing our products can be a little difficult but at the beginning.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Especially when one learns to understand that in peanuts may contain a donor animal additives as a color, it seems to comply with the ethics of so many hurdles and traps to leave quickly for courage.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen not only wrote a book, &quot;Vegan Issimo - animal substances and their alternatives,&quot; explains the many ingredients, but the food and detergents.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot;We know a scanner gradually developed views and the signs and logos,&quot; it is sometimes better to do than to stay small steps or to stumble, &quot;Proctor knows.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Of veganism, he is an important moral signal, which is proposing to raise awareness.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Perhaps he can't quite call it his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question its habits.</seg>

		<seg id="0">New nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking</seg>
		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which could spoil the fun of smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime of smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests are needed before tests on humans, which can take some years, said Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, the first results are good.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We are very hopeful that we can help this kind of vaccination strategy once millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have tried all methods available on the market, but that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,&quot; said Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus, the liver cells that produce a constant stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies in the blood Molekuele hunt the nicotine and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which is a smoker no nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine, their normal level of activity.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mice without vaccination would have a &quot;time out&quot; on the other hand, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine have reached their brains.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The experiments are described in the journal Science in translational medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Former tobacco Impfstoffe failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The vaccinations had to be ordered to maintain the antibodies Pegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be much lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As Professor Crystal, could be a future vaccine for people, if he is sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely that smokers would use to stop him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;You know: If they are beginning to smoke, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine is no longer enough, and that helps them to overcome the habit,&quot; he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists said, the results are interesting, but at the same time warned that further research is necessary.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohamed Morsi, the presidential oath, but his day of triumph may not be the end of the political disputes in Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt,&quot; as he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, and thus took over from Hosni Mubarak, was driven from office 16 months ago.</seg>
		<seg id="3">With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He put the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, which sits on the Nile, and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today the Egyptian people has laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said the 60-year-old Morsi, an U.S. educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been taken since its founding 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organization targeted by the respective government.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Morsi arrived shortly after eleven pm local time in a small car Konvoi.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court, shouting for joy about the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak era, the traffic was halted only temporarily, so that the Konvoi could cross the busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Brotherhood has derided as an uncharismatisches &quot;spare tire&quot; increased his personal prestige in his victory speech and a free day, not only for himself as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the autocratic Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; declared in a blue suit with red tie Morsi dressed the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, in which he gave the oath of office.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his inaugural speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem, which he listened in Habachtstellung.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On his arrival, he was among hundreds of people in the largest university classroom with chants of &quot;the army and the people are one hand&quot; welcomes.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, University of Cairo in the 1970s has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups.</seg>
		<seg id="16">On Friday, Morsi presented a symbolic oath on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he has vowed to reclaim presidential powers that had been accepted by the Military Council hunted out of office by the head of state.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual in front of the parliament he prevents the will of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Morsi's speech at the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines to require plans to $100 for passengers who want to pack in a carry-on bag.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines intends to up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even if the announcement on Wednesday that passengers would keep the whole box.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new fee applies for hand luggage in the baggage compartment above the seat, small pockets in the seat remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said that $25 be emitted if they pay the fee in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O &quot;Malley said that the fee of $100 was intended to encourage travelers to look ahead to the payment.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We do not want to compute this sum,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second checked baggage fees.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers who tried to get around this, therefore, as much as possible in your hand luggage, with the result that the baggage compartments above the seats are crowded.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O &quot;Malley said, the new fee is not really a question of earning money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It was the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the box on the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that a passenger must check in at the gate of Frontier, a piece of luggage for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O &quot;Malley said, the site of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Frontier's new carry-on fee will only come into force in the summer, there is not yet a specific date.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often grumbled about luggage fees and other fees, but airlines are happy to back.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that the transport of luggage cost money, and passengers should pay for this service if they wished.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But so far most of the fingers of charges for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. three years ago, was the first to charge for hand luggage and later followed All Giant Air, a budget airline.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who followed the additional fees.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He estimated in a report in December 2011 that bring the hand baggage fee is $50 million per year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious what would await him at the gate when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Distant planets, black holes, gravitational waves or experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Distant worlds.</seg>
		<seg id="4">More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have found.</seg>
		<seg id="5">If there is at least some of them, no one knows.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The selection is difficult: Should one look for gravitational waves?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Or prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Or discover earth-like planets and to search for alien life, perhaps?</seg>
		<seg id="9">These questions confront the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For their program &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The budget for such missions, &quot;l&quot; is about one billion euros.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The elite met in Paris in early September, the European space research to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">30 ideas were discussed, five of them are now in the final round.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Many bodies on the proposals, tick with the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A final decision is expected to fall in the next few days by the scientific program committee.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A total of four big questions that Esa has selected the missions of the 2007 &quot;program&quot; cosmic vision &quot;to find answers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?</seg>
		<seg id="19">The exact processes for the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the formation of planets that orbit these stars still lie in the proverbial dark.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A large infrared telescope in space could pierce the darkness.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise there?</seg>
		<seg id="22">To investigate this matter, &quot;dynasty,&quot; launching the space telescope in 2017, will be investigated with the 500 known planetary systems in our vicinity.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the possibilities are limited, Khufu is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With larger instruments, the astronomers and even the composition of their atmospheres analysed organic-rich fine fraction of planets and to search for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: Gases, which are seen as sign of biological activity.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How does the solar system?</seg>
		<seg id="26">Ultimately, this question is to give information about the conditions for the emergence of life.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The magnetic activity plays an important role of a star and the interaction of their magnetic Felds, as well as its continued particle radiation with the planetary system.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In our solar system to study these processes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">With the &quot;Solar Orbiter&quot; Esa already has a mission of the series (the budget is around half a billion euros) approved for this question.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The probe will start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The researchers are also of great interest to Jupiter and its moons.</seg>
		<seg id="32">You want to find out what role played in the development of the giant planet of the solar system.</seg>
		<seg id="33">This is the kind of the first of the three L - the &quot;cosmic vision&quot; missions - programme.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The probe &quot;juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey in 2022.</seg>
		<seg id="35">ACHT years later they reached Jupiter and the planet's atmosphere and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede, Kalli Sto.</seg>
		<seg id="36">What are the basic physical laws of the universe?</seg>
		<seg id="37">The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus whether the known laws of nature are still valid.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Maybe there are also variations that could point the way to a new theory, the physicists can come together under the umbrella of all known laws of nature.</seg>
		<seg id="39">As the universe was born, and what is it?</seg>
		<seg id="40">The Big Bang created our universe 13.7 billion years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Besides the material from which stars, planets and creatures bombarded as we are, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, accelerated by the actions of the Universe.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The researchers do not yet know what physical laws were in the first seconds of the CMB, which are still dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="43">With &quot;Euclid&quot; already approved by the Esa here a M- 2020 mission, scheduled to be launched.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, and thus allow conclusions on the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Who could make the race</seg>
		<seg id="46">Of the 30 proposals at the end of the selection procedure will remain only two.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The best chances of approval as a mission, according to many experts, &quot;Lisa,&quot; a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Including physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="49">They have been proven to date.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Elisa could succeed, the scientists behind the project hope.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The mission is one of two or three probes existing detector that will be deployed in space.</seg>
		<seg id="52">He could prove that unlike plants on Earth and gravitational waves that have emerged during the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.</seg>
		<seg id="53">FOUR more proposals to compete for the second L mission: A large X-ray telescope called &quot;Athena,&quot; is to explore the black holes, among other things, &quot;icy planets,&quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism,&quot; a mission for the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder,&quot; is to identify and investigate the organic-rich planets.</seg>
		<seg id="54">Among other proposals are already resigned to the samples - returning from Mars, Venus and the exploration of the moon, asteroids and solar physics.</seg>

		<seg id="2">After receiving hundreds of thousands of their insurers a letter of resignation, the president threw the Republicans in recent days that he had deceived the American public.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yesterday, Obama watered down his original promise.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, can keep them,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who receive such communications, to look for a new insurance on the open market.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Most citizens might be a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than received.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Parents can choose from intersexuellen children &quot;indeterminate gender.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany is the first European nation where a third sex is recognised for children who were not born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">No longer will newborns be rigidly male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Under the new law, parents have to explain a sex can be more for these children, but &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;no&quot; on the birth certificate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The aim of the law is to take the pressure off parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for a sex allocation for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersexuellen people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A year later, according to the BBC, said: &quot;I am neither man nor woman intersexuelle person.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I maintain the patchwork, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">An estimated one in 2,000 children every year, either as a boy or a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are among the Inter Sexu Ellen, a group that, among the diagnosis &quot;sexual Differenzierungs disorder&quot; (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson was probably intersexuell.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Understanding the gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts recommend in the US, we should use the best available information on sex, if a provision is not possible to wait and not on the psychological and physical development of the child, before we go - if any - for an operation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law &quot;blade for a good cause.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Intersexuelle children pose an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have life-threatening diseases that require a surgical procedure, but for most children are not,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait, like developing the identity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The scientific data about how a child develops his gender identity, are not at all.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one knows why it happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In a report to the European Commission from 2011 states intersexuelle people were indistinguishable from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not geschlechtsbezogen, but by their biological condition, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically not both at the same time, or when one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These properties were in second-tier sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or in Chromosom structures and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced intersexuelle and transgender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and Vorurteils crime.</seg>
		<seg id="21">No boys have been consistent with the picture of a special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Meanwhile, it is in Australia and Nepal for adults, male, female, or &quot;third sex&quot; on official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, Australians (52) and Norrie May Welby - the world's first &quot;recognized&quot; largely unknown person after a court had granted lifelong retention of a &quot;unspecified&quot; sexual status.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Besides the German cards have in the future, and a third, to intersexuell, the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news story on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of French parliamentarians have signed a petition to the strict Catholic country that the &quot;gender theory&quot; should be removed from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The U.S.-based site Catholic Online also spoke out against the German law, saying: &quot;If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we distort two other pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">The mother of a newborn baby, they told of Maryland would be better if babies will be assigned a sex at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;The parents&quot; existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child, &quot;she said of the parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and security.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children who were born with both male and female parts, were seen as Hermaphroditen, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ten years ago, the medicine the sex as something that you could build and destroy.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But meanwhile, questioned the ethical bases of operation, as is now known, the complexity of gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child's upbringing with the sex assigned to them.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the mid-20th century called it&quot; a psychiatric emergency, &quot;said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If such a child was born, then called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals, Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives - educate the parents as a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and consider whether such a person as male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one under the title &quot;John / Joan&quot; case in 1966, his controversial theories.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a botched circumcision to neuter the child to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;This case is presented as a successful example of a conversion, but not what it was,&quot; says Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">With 38 but he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">According to Drescher, there are still physicians who would have encouraged this approach.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries came to the public, &quot;not happy with the result.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such as Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never lead a &quot;satisfactory&quot; life as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So his external body and the testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">At the age of 12 he was awarded female hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I am not a girl,&quot; he said on ABCNews.com</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But because he was depressed and knew that something was amiss, he demanded his medical files.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he found was shocking.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilised am birth - and no one has ever told me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a DSD that his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After he learned the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and remove his breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The operation is becoming barren.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project that intersexuelle people are perceived as normal.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar - Mattis, managing director of rights group based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;could&quot; encourage places like Catalonia and stamped.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not&quot; assign, &quot;she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We fear that favours interventions.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we do not know yet how it will impact the law, so we can only speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar, Mattis said that her organization would support the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adult recognition as a third sex.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law relates to the allocation at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This is not a fight to the little children should be forced to produce at this time.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their own bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual Differenzierungs disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law &quot;and&quot; both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Andro resistance gene.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because of the Rezeptor Defektes of target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">In 29 and today is married Katie; she works as a researcher in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">While it is barren, but hopes that adoption or a surrogate mother to get a child.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents, and they must not make hasty decisions,&quot; Baratz said.</seg>
		<seg id="76">They will be given the time to do various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they are &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; letter.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this way, everything is fine - it attracts the child size and loves it.</seg>
		<seg id="78">It was a wonderful baby and the parents.</seg>
		<seg id="79">And we must not rush to make an operation, which is not irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;This includes the children in the decision and the fear is that parents, because they believe that they would not do the right thing,&quot; she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="81">The child ultimately decides on the sex, which is more suited to him - and that is wonderful.</seg>
		<seg id="82">This will allow children to make the decision themselves.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in the car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box, which will take place in the dashboard of each car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, which record every kilometer and report the information to the authorities, are central to a controversial trial of Washington and the state was planning to revise the outdated system of financing American roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The normally rather dull road planning suddenly has sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups and called for the government of the small boxes to record mileage charges - and possibly, where they were taken and then the information can be used for the calculation of tax, oaths.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Tea Party is appalled.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But while no agreement can be reached on a course of action in Congress, several states do not wait any longer.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are looking at how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile travelled.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance, already tested.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This really is a must for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It is not something that we will only use may be,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, director of the Southern California Assn. Of Governmental Movements, which has a record of a milestone for all California motorists in the state since 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The way we pay these taxes, will change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes, Americans pay at the pump is broke.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But in America is no longer as much petrol as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars use less gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The state-owned petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not risen in 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians do not dare to high gasoline prices, raise the tax by a penny.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gas tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, an expert on commercial law at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The federal government has recently provided 500 cars with black boxes, which are designed to test a meilenbasiertes payment system.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;This is the best option in the long term,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Bureaucrats call it meilenbasierte user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Not surprisingly, the idea of urban liberals, because, for example, the tax could be used to influence the behaviour to reduce congestion and greenhouse gases.</seg>
		<seg id="24">California's planners are counting on the system in the elaboration of strategies that are to be achieved, ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal government on climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The free marketers are taken with the idea of the Reason Foundation, drivers pay according to a pre-arranged route.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People pay directly for what they get.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers, who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move toward meilenbasierter reckoning.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would include 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the majority in the House of Representatives, the thrust and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles in everyday life on the way to work or in the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">However, several states and cities move on their own in this direction.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most active is Oregon, which enlists 5,000 drivers for the greatest experiment in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="36">New York City also is considering.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois is testing it in a limited way with lorries.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I- 95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are currently investigating how to introduce the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not an universal hit.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where 50 volunteers have been recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical at the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The people did not want it.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When the test started, warned the ACLU of Nevada on their website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in full-blown surveillance devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for more affordable technology that can capture the state mileage, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Thus, Khan, the public would be unlawful.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The company is not originally taken to help states in the taxation of motorists.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Rather, it was their goal to be in an emerging market for car insurance, which involves paying drivers based on miles driven.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices tested on the road planners are also interesting, because they do not use GPS and provide only limited information that will be uploaded regularly via modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;The people are more willing to participate, if not record their speed and locations,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">In some of these public pilot programs were made big mistakes.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There is much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with it to give drivers a number of choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">You can opt for a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they do not choose equipment and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a skeptical public by providing the devices with more functions than smaller.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York City transit officials want to develop a device on taxation, will also pay the parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data are collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate,&quot; it said in a planning document.</seg>
		<seg id="60">But some transport planners wonder whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge red herring.</seg>
		<seg id="61">The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund through tax on fuel.</seg>
		<seg id="62">An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, are imposed, so that they pay a fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no reason for an operation if there is an aspirin,&quot; said Randy aero-engine, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Security concerns in Mozambique grow amid clashes between influential personalities</seg>
		<seg id="1">Thousands of people gathered in the center Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of the founder and first president, Samora Machel of Mozambique to sing in a rare public demonstration calls for peace.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want peace, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, director of an investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Fear for the future of the country, their business attire for a T-shirt with the words &quot;we demand security&quot; traded in Portuguese, and on Thursday joined the crowd in Independence Square in the capital.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">RENAMO was formerly a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by the white government of Rhodesia and later of the Apartheit government of South Africa in a bid to destabilize the country's independent government.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts consider it unlikely that zurueckfalle the country back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could invest in the next few years to more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tension.</seg>
		<seg id="10">RENAMO claimed that the government was provoked by the recent clashes on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Rena Mos, would have attacked.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The escalated attacks on the former rebels, as government troops tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama and Renamo - bases attacked, leader of the group, said Rena, spokesman for the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government has accused Renamo of blame for the clashes and the organization that attacked soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Compared to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as &quot;losers&quot; who &quot;wants to use all of its remaining forces to prove that the government can impose its decisions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">FRELIMO and Renamo both stress that they want to avoid a war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the concerns have increased since Maza Nga was quoted as saying that Renamo was the 1992 peace agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To the FT he declared that he meant that FRELIMO does not respect the agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously,&quot; said Maza Nga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;Here we have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who heads collide,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">RENAMO, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement, concessions and financial concessions from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Rena's electoral success since 1992, while a newer party shrink from a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably will improve in the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Maza Nga said that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency,&quot; said Maza Nga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear what Renamo capacities, but she has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South ties.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which lies a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira, but finds itself in the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, a month after the use of the railway after Renamo announced an attack on the track.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Maza Nga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">RENAMO wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique,&quot; said Maza Nga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability has increased frustration with the government, said Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent Entfuehrungs wave.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar sultans, a protester, said that people simply wanted stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">FRELIMO and Renamo &quot;no interest, they simply want to regain peace and usable roads,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Whenever it comes to council meetings to the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster laugh.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Gemeindesaeckl in Wangen - Schoenberg's stove is well stocked and debt does not know the administration since 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="3">For the financial year 2012 can be made in this sense as an unqualified success.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This was at the launch of the annual accounts for 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As Andrea Roth, the administrative budget is planned with about 7.6 million more than a million higher than that.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Ueberschuss of the administrative budget of around EUR 1.8 million is about one million euros over the approach.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It was the Ueberschuss especially higher business tax revenues and the county's share of the income tax.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The capital budget was again well above the planned values.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Instead of the EUR 1.5 million last year, it was EUR 2.5 million.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;This is essentially due to the increase in supply from the administrative budget,&quot; says Roth.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As planned, made in 2012, has been less investment than the backward areas and higher.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Overall, the general reserve fund could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked the mouth and her team for their good work.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;This work cannot simply shaking out of the sleeve,&quot; Gerster praised overlooking the annual financial statements.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He and the local councils were visibly over the good figures.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could come at the public soon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Through the good financial situation could forgo the community in the past to high rates.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But this, in turn, have been reduced several times, according to Gerster, grants from the country.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For these grants from various compensatory sticks, there are conditions.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Among other things, the cities and communities who apply for grants, with some rates.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, because investment in the coming years, for which we would like to support,&quot; announced Gerster, in this context.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Despair scream of an Obama voter</seg>
		<seg id="1">I have twice elected President Barack Obama in the hope that change is possible</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blockade tactics of the Republican</seg>
		<seg id="3">The blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes</seg>
		<seg id="4">Obama's memoirs about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is the second year student at the Harvard Medical School.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I read a terribly sad book.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a book that I thought it would be sad during the second year of medical studies to liven up and give me hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;the Audacity to Win&quot; (gaining courage) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama to the presidential election in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I'm finished with my patients, &quot;and go to bed, then the book leads me back to a time when politics could rob millions and inspired speeches.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election was a landslide victory and kept the news to guide the historic importance of this hour.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates and my parents wept with joy, all the newspapers that they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionaries was on his way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">As Obama moved to office back in 2008, he had approval rates of 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if taken from a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years since I made my voice for the first time, something has changed.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But there is simply nothing that I could imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I acknowledge the great and varied things that Obama has reached, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for medical insurance until military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have tipped too many aspirations that our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after countless times I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances, brings me to my point to the end.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I have reached a point of political desperation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Republican blockade policy does not explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It does not explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers will be punished, the government misconduct.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It does not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why it bypassed public financing and spending limits during the presidential election.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House's efforts to restrain the media are the &quot;most aggressive... Since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And, most recently, it could not excuse the inability in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act a simple website.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know if this is what I should have expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If I should have understood in 18 that could contradict the government's work to their previous political campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Obviously, the parliamentarians, not a predictable rate, because of an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre public discussion.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But when I look at the above examples, then they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And that bothers me most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I have 2012 elected Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed to be able to determine its direction and positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes that we had heard for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But with the drop in approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book all the harder.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In a meeting with election officials after the decision, he said his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I hope that we will find our magic again,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We must remember who we are.</seg>
		<seg id="42">There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>
