		<seg id="2">Bwelle and its team spend nearly each weekend therewith to treat hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the west African country, there are not many physicians, only one for 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or with your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the Top of 10 the &quot;CNN Heroes of 2013&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The victor receives 250,000 dollars to the continuation of its extraordinary work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years saw be lost Georges Bwelle with on, how sick father again and again the consciousness and traveled to hospitals, that did not control the means in order to help it.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle became 1981 in a car accident in the vicinity of Yaoundé, that injures capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First it had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation, that expanded on its brain and caused there a hematoma, that should impair it for the remainder of its life, formed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It gave no Neurochirurgen in Cameroon&quot;, so Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have brought out it from Cameroon if we had had the money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead spent Bwelle years therewith, its father in overfilled to accompany clinics and hospitals, in order to get there the treatment, that they had to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not simple&quot;, comments on Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">One can leave at five o'clock mornings the house and race is to the hospital in order to be the first, and yet not first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are very many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some people die even because they must wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation did hardly change since Bwelles father 2002 died.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only a physician for 5,000 people apiece, so the world health organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">On the other hand the ratio in the United States is about a physician for 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Yet even if there would be a physician for it, most Kameruner could not afford the visit.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two of five people in the country live beneath the poverty line and almost three quarters the medical expenses in the country are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The single problem, that it have, is poverty&quot;, says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And poverty makes it impossibly to enjoy life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">To see suffer its father and so many of its compatriots let ripen in Bwelle the decision to undertake somewhat on the other hand.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and be carried out volunteer team in the last year 700 free operations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It became even physician and works as a container surgeon in the Central hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Moreover it established a public-spirited organization by the name of ASCOVIME that travels at weekends into rural areas and offers there free medical provision.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008 it and its volunteer group helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">He would force himself nearly every Friday and up to 30 people in small penance and go tied up with that medical equipment on the roof over unfortified grounds into the villages, that require aid.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Always all does not pass smooth.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They had to push already more than once the vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Yet if they arrive, they will receive like heros: a banquet, song and dance and the best lodging that the place has to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, free medical provision is is actual a reason for the celebrations and Bwelle – with its wide smile and its boundless energy – gladly in the cheerful celebration there.</seg>
		<seg id="35">At the next morning, the team begins then with the investigation of hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Per trip treat we 500 people&quot;, so Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come out of a vicinity of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of this Wochenendkliniken offers medical provision in a row of areas.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexually transferable illnesses.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others receive crutch, contributed glasses or free birth documents – a document that is required for the school, however many poor families simply do not afford can.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Evenings the team carries out operations simple with local anesthetic.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations take place normally in a school, the city hall or a dwelling; after the intervention, the patients rise and go into the recovery area to make around place for the neighbors.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The illumination for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed of the generator of the group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work into the early morning hours on Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is a strenuous stint, but the village musicians help normally to hold the team motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;You drum the entire night, so that we awake remain and our work continue can&quot;, says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday the team will go then back into the city, tiredly, but proud of the performed work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group – a mixture out of kamerunischen physicians and foreign medicine student – carried out free operations in the last year 700 and knows that she causes an enormous difference with its work for the people, whom she helps.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man explained that the free operation of a strip breach that he had received would enable it now to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;That changes the future of my family&quot;, meant the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Next to the Wochenendkliniken and its work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle works also at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="51">With this second job, it finances 60% of its public-spirited activity, so Bwelle; the remainder comes from private contributions.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I knows really not, when it sleeps&quot;, says Katie O' Malley that studies in the second year at the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and cooperates voluntarily in Bwelles group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">It is always either in the hospital or tries to raise money for the organization so that it can go on this campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For medicine students and nursing students such as O' Malley, that come out of the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, is this a chance to gather practical experiences, that never would get it at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We can in operations at the same time be, where we help, blood to dab away or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle hold&quot;, explains O' Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">That never would be in America possible as a medicine student in the second year.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The students pay its trip to Cameroon normally even and bring frequently contributed Sanitätsmaterial with.</seg>
		<seg id="58">If they are however first once in Yaoundé, Bwelle receives the lodging, the carrier and the instructions.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;It is entire without doubt a hero&quot;, says O' Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">It dedicates its life of this organization and its wish to help the kamerunischen people, knows no boundaries.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bwelle, the nearly permanent work is no load.</seg>
		<seg id="62">To help other to a happier life and to fulfill therewith a promise, that it gave its father, large joy prepares it.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy, if I this work would make&quot;, means Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope, it sees, what I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I make it in order to bring people again for laughing and in order to mitigate the pains.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Cardinals are are the around highest clerics in the Catholic church after the pope and it it also, the one popes select so that Franziskus therewith the first group will appoint of men, who will co-operate in the end in the choice of its successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Presently there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However a cardinal, who reached an age of 80 years, can participate, no longer in the pope choice – that falls a group of 120 &quot;cardinals&quot; entitled to vote to.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In an explanation, in which the message was announced, father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican said would take place, it a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony would be held off to the appointment of the new cardinals, that would be well known also as a Konsistorium.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Franziskus concluded, its decision to the summoning of the Konsistoriums in February in advance well known to give, so that other meeting, that the participation of cardinals out of all world require, planned will can&quot;, said Lombardi.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote probably would have sunk until February.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He explained, a pope appoints normally so many cardinals such as compel so that the number of the cardinals entitled to vote again 120 would amount to, and so many cardinals would like over 80, how he.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Let the Konsistorium in the next year be therefore significant because it would be the first since the choice of Franziskus in March these years, so Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Presently there are one certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.</seg>

		<seg id="12">Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The cardinals will be also the first, that are called since the development of the advice established by Franziskus of the cardinals, a group of eight cardinals out of the entire world, that have the order to find possibilities to the reformation of the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past, the pope of all decided alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now has Franziskus these eight cardinals selected, that it help should&quot;, said Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It explained, let it be &quot;well possible&quot; that Franziskus the cardinals around advice please.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Yet previously we were not in this situation – that is all entirely new.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said that characteristically the bishops would be called out of large places to cardinals, but Franziskus of &quot;full surprises would stick – we do not know therefore, whom he appoints&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Are elite Europe ready to make with Great Britain of businesses?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Business for Britain was started in April with the intention to bring and to define the economy at a table, what that would like to change, that provide in Great Britain for prosperity and work, at our relations to the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To this purpose, we gave the largest and most comprehensive survey under British business leaders in order and asked it, what it over Great Britain, that think economy and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov questioned over 1,000 managements out of the economy, that portray into about the British business sizes, -sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results of the survey will surprise many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found out that the predominant majority of the businesses exports outside of Europe in the meantime and concentrates on countries, that modernize and grow, while the countries stagnate in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They wish for that by government side new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored instead of staying with the long and strenuous process, to reform the obscure EU institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Ask about its view to certain legally regulated subjects – of the cartel right to the product legislation – is the majority the business leaders the view that become should gotten back control of these key competences after Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">General discontent ruled over the domestic market because according to statements of the businesses the costs of that would predominate Brussels directions in the meantime the advantages to be part of Europe trade zone – even 40 percent of the large firms agreed that to, that are traditional at the Europe friendliest.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In the end, and that says probably most, yielded our inquiry of business leaders that a clear majority wishes for of Great Britain a course toward variation of the agreement and a relation to the EU that is based on trade, not on politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This insight, that is found in business of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy presses on a &quot;meaningful variation&quot;, that brings the notebook of the actions again to Great Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It concerns much – a change of the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead in 16 percent to an opinion change for the benefit of the whereabouts in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The prime minister should have no doubts: This survey shows that the British economy stands behind its plan for the renegotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership.</seg>

		<seg id="1">They stand removes no 100 meters from one another: On Tuesday the new B 33 was taken in Gutach-pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot in operation - in visibility expanse of the older city hall traffic light.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Two plants so closely together: Intention or sign citizen stroke?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Gutachs mayor clearly answered this question yesterday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The city hall traffic light is certain at that time installs become, because this the school way&quot;, clarified Eckert yesterday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Kluser traffic light secures both cyclist and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Let the plant official in operation taken yesterday be important to the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We have 'dug' the museum, two churches, cure park, the bus stop, a physician and a bank as well as the traffic river out of the residential area.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;In the high traffic recovery and pedestrian recovery must to its security a further traffic light here&quot;, so Eckert.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Also Peter Arnold of the mayor velvet confirms this open castle.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;According to current measurements pass through on the B 33 daily about 12,000 vehicles the community Gutach, therefrom are about ten percent heavy harvest traffic&quot;, emphasizes Arnold.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Therefore let the building of a further traffic light be more than necessary: &quot;Security goes here simply before&quot;, so Arnold.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Altogether four traffic shows had been carried out, also a circle traffic was rejected angedacht, to be sure because of the narrow in the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again.</seg>
		<seg id="13">All was tested from according to Arnold in the location choice of the traffic light mast before: &quot;By means of one extra for us with especially long wood tribes of loaded vehicles we have ausgestestet whether these vehicles can pull out out of the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without snapping&quot; the traffic light mast.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Traffic light plant expensive the round 15,000 Euro itself is that &quot;most modern, what it presently on the market gives&quot;, clarified Arnold.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The plant is equipped with colored LEDs, that so strongly illuminate that the lights of the drivers are to be recognized for example also in depth standing sun well.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is and thrifty also: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just once eight watts.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Per direction, there are three lighting systems.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar sensors.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.</seg>
		<seg id="20">If the street is free, green comes directly for the pedestrian if not, lasts it about 15 seconds.</seg>
		<seg id="21">A radar sensor further tests whether the green phase can be concluded for the pedestrian.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;Should a group or gehbehinderte people over the street go, becomes the green phase extends, it comes therefore every certainly over the roadway&quot;, explained Arnold.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Naturally the driver had to follow here as a partner and had to observe the roadway.</seg>
		<seg id="24">This was not yesterday the case: Hardly the traffic light showed for pedestrian green, rustled an upper class vehicle through - in illuminating red.</seg>

		<seg id="11">&quot;Germany must wake up&quot;, explains Oliver green, president of the BITMi who represents small and middle IT firms in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Believe German businesses, the USA placed a nearly just as large risk there now like China if it would concern industry espionage and data theft, so a survey that was published in July by the adviser firm EY.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In the documents oozed by Snowden, there was to be sure previously no record that the USA transmitted the business secrets of foreign businesses at own firms.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Politicians expressed its worry about that that the EU certain IT should and Internet were missing possibilities and it should reduce its dependence of the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The businesses are relating to this sceptical.</seg>

		<seg id="20">All in Germany is subsidized, by the coal over cars to the agriculture.</seg>
		<seg id="21">All, up to the IT SECTOR.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nevertheless range and technical subtlety of the US espionage authorities uncovered by the Snowden uncovering shocked firms, that had seen previously the largest espionage risk in China.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the Cloud Computing, a large variation takes place because European business leaders are more aware themselves now, that in the USA stored data of the jurisdiction there are subject and potentially are endangerd therefore.</seg>

		<seg id="26">Many German business leaders represent the view, the youngest reports confirm simply only, what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful countries want to steal its most valuable secrets and these must be guarded therefore around every price.</seg>
		<seg id="27">That economy espionage takes place, is no surprise.</seg>
		<seg id="28">That was already always so.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;It was many years long a subject and has itself through the current discussion not fundamental changed&quot;, says Kurt ram, chairperson of the chemistry business BASF.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The Americans spy out us on more commercially and more industrially plain so how we make that also, for it is in the national interest, to defend our businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The business management does not boast normally over the countermeasure, that one seized, for that provides aggressors advantages.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In large businesses, already long petition loud becomes colleagues that the bringing of a free USB stick on a fair or that not advisably would be unguarded situation calm a laptop in the hotel room, mildly said.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of directors with car manufacturer Audi, says that it has belonged for years to the standard practice to gather the mobile phones before a Vorstandstreffen so that they cannot be used as bugging devices.</seg>

		<seg id="37">In Germany, many market leaders worldwide these businesses in the respective niche are.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Published bomb with seat in Montreal also no flight test data for its brand-new airplane of the CSeries and delivered no new information about whether the airplane could go in accordance with the ambitious timetable in the next September into the commercial utilization.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the boy distance flight of the test airplane one and a half months ago only three further starts followed until now what lets questionably appear it, whether the test phase passes planned how.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results remained behind the prognoses back and led to a stock market crash of more than eight percent at the stock exchange of Toronto.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, analyst in nationally bank financial, sank to on Thursday its estimation of &quot;outperform&quot; &quot;sector perform&quot; in the regard on that that the share in the next between one and two quarters possesses a limited course potential.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;To be sure became weaker delivery numbers in airplanes most extensive expects, but of the margin development in the carrier area are we very clearly disappoints&quot;, said Doerksen into a customer letter.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We are the view that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries, if the test program yelled at before for the airplane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If to be sure in the coming months no new orders are announced, let's expect that the market becomes vis-à-vis the program more sceptically.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bomb hopes that the airplane row of the CSeries can catapult the business into the lower market segment, that is dominated presently by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test airplane was introduced in March the public and flew to month-long delays for the first time in September.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Yet previously binding orders are for the CSeries with 177 moderate because potential buyers would like to wait and see for the results of the flight tests, whether the statements of the business are with respect to fuel efficiency and Kosteneinsparpotenzial of the new nozzle traffic airplane correct.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Presently there are altogether 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Chairman of the board Pierre Beaudoin gives itself confidently that Bombardier would reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial utilization of the jet.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The business management assured on Thursday vis-à-vis analysts and media moreover, who would lie program in the appointment plan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test airplane more long on the ground remained than expects&quot;, Beaudoin did not say in a telephone conference and joined had been thereto, during the standing time of the airplane ground tests and software updates prepared.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Every manufacturer plans differently.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We concluded to undertake a first flight and to suspend then a revision period, what we did also.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That happens during the entire flight program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test airplanes would start presumably in the next weeks, the remaining shortly after that, was named it of business side.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Nevertheless analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the boy distance flight the first customer can take an airplane of the CSeries in operation.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bomb explained, would review it the planning for the starting (ICE) and would update this in the next months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;The slow ahead step the flight test – also if it obviously Bombardiers of internal planning correspond – strengthens our view, that itself the starting on the first quarter 2015 shifts&quot;, said Doerksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter with end on the 30th of September, Bombardiers net profit fell on 147 million dollars and/or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and/or 9 cents per share in the previous year.</seg>

		<seg id="28">The net orders fell of 83 airplanes on 26.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The orders in hand in the air branch and space flight branch amounted to on the 30th of September 32.9 billions of dollar and was therewith unchanged vis-à-vis the 31st of December.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In the area of aviation and space flight lay the results in the frame of our specification, but the low incoming orders and the market ratios altogether were disappointing&quot;, said Beaudoin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The revenue in the air branch and space flight branch fell around 13 percent on two billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bomb, the railroad manufacturer largest worldwide, announced that the revenue in this branch climbed around nearly eleven percent on 2.1 billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The orders in hand in the carrier branch amounted to on the 30th of September 32.6 billions of dollar and easily was increased therewith vis-à-vis the 31st of December.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists were able to throw more light on that, in which context stands that tail fronds of a dog with its mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier researches had shown that happy dogs with the tail was more to the right wedelten (from the viewpoint of the dog), while it with nervous dogs the left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yet now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and can react on that.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist of the university Trient, said: &quot;in humans is well well known, that the left and right side of the brain differently on stimuli react, the positive or negative emotion evoke&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we tried to look at this in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It noted moreover that with dogs exactly like in humans the right side of the brain for the movement of the left side responsibly would be and reversed, and that both hemispheres different rolls played in the feelings.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In order to learn more about that how dogs react to the tail fronds lateral of its members of the same species, supervised the researchers the animals while these films of other dogs looked at.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the heart frequency of the quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Probably we will understand soon why the tail moves once in the one, once into the other direction</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;we have the dogs films with dogs shown – either a nature loyal version or a silhouette, around distracting other aspects to eliminate, and we could therewith the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right drive&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If the animals saw, like an otherwise inexpressive dog the tail to the right moved has (of the perspective of the wedelnden dog out of seen), remained relaxes it totally.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The tail inclination was however especially to the left (again out of perspective of the dog, the wedelt), its heart frequency and it got out saw restlessly.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the opinion of professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate intentionally together through these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It is not convinced rather that the dogs would have learned from experience, in which movements they should worry, and when.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It said: &quot;if one different encounters with other dogs has and that fronds with the tail into a direction sooner with friendly behavior connects is and the right side sooner a less friendly behavior produces, reacts one to basis of these experiences&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that the insights could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of its animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">John Bradshaw, expert for dog behavior and guest scholar at the faculty for veterinary medicine of the university of Bristol explained, this had not been the first study, with which examined became, whether to the left and to the right for dogs would be important.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year found out a team of the university of Lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left, if they look at an aggressive dog, and concerns to the right, if it a satisfied dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In another research project at the university of Victoria in Canada following did not stand: &quot;dogs go sooner on a robot dog to, if be, tail' to the left of wedelt and to the right to become instead of restless – exactly the other way around as in the Italian study&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to its statements, the differences could stir therefore that the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films and/or the robot dogs as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study how dogs react to real dogs, could help, explained it.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;To be sure gives it considerable records for many different mammals, that both sides of the brain for different purposes uses become, but must many of the details yet determines become – and dogs form there no exception&quot;, so Bradshaw.</seg>

		<seg id="38">Even in the rent dwelling, the one or others could be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect clarifies up.</seg>
		<seg id="39">But always the existing dwelling not -freely can be reshaped age-appropriately and therewith barrier, also if it yet so beautifully lies.</seg>
		<seg id="40">This experience must raced make Waltraud.</seg>
		<seg id="41">To be sure one could install within the dwelling a stairway elevator, would be the way paved also with stairways up to the dwelling door however the by far larger hindrance.</seg>

		<seg id="8">The ascertainments brought to light that Ditta consumed regularly drugs of the class A, after in tests traces had been found of cocaine in its hairs, on its billfold and at credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 tried it to procure prohibited information about the arrest of these men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All four suspects were supervised at that time Yorkshire of the police in the frame of a large investigative procedure to the heroin trade and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and west.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Jointly with 32 other people they later were arrested after the police guaranteed heroin and cocaine in the value of 1.5 million pounds as well as 200,000 pounds in a row of house searches at cash.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Ditta, 42, transmitted information at the criminals because it feared, its drug addiction could become public.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today Ditta, that became color works for the office Solicitors in Blackburn, found at the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two accusation points because of handicap of the justice for indebted and convicts.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It admitted the cocaine possession in an earlier inquiry.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The lawyer was transported after the police out found in its ascertainments against Scarborough, that this had stood in February 2011 into regular by telephone contact with Ditta.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two investigators followed the suspecting and saw how he went to Dittas house and put there the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black gulf glove under the trashcan of the lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Shortly after it had delivered the drugs, telephoned Scarborough regularly with Ditta, that was in the supper in the soccer stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood park.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer returned home, got himself the drugs and then nine communications between both were exchanged.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Before court became well known that Ditta was a &quot;regular consumer&quot; of cocaine, after in tests drugs of the class A in its hairs, its billfold had been discovered and on its credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta later was arrested, fought however off to take cocaine and said, it had spoken with the presumed Dealer because this would be its client, and maintained, its discussion would be subject secret&quot; to the &quot;lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During its arrest, Ditta took its billfold and tried to remove a row of credit cards, but they were guaranteed and was taken a hair sample from it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In the police interrogation, it indicated would operate, it both would call an office and client under its private address and at the job it at home because of juristic matters.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Before court became well known that he had called important participants of the drug trade, of whom he had represented some before, after significant arrests and had informed about that, what the investigators knew over it.</seg>
		<seg id="24">District attorney Anne Whyte did not say: &quot;a punishment lawyer should better than everyone others know, that one the law breaks&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Ditta is accused the abuse of its position as a punishment defender because he admitted himself too very with certain client.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The questionable relation is not simple that of a drug dealer, but rather a drug dealer who furnishes its lawyer with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">A part of its communications was undoubtedly legitimate, for it was the lawyer of these people.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Yet that went out far over the boundaries of a normal relation between lawyer and client.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It caused the police ascertainments so far like possible toward so that they were able to investigate further its criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr. Ditta brought therewith its occupation state in discredit.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It stood let certain client to near, especially Scarborough, and it it to that its independence was compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta did not show each false behavior of itself and maintained: &quot;if I a corrupt lawyer would be, what I am, and information at Scarborough transmit wanted, would become I no 15 hours wait, but rather that immediately do&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Yet after the hearing, Superintendent lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: &quot;Mr. Ditta has the step of a punishment defender to a criminal in the moment done, when he began, drugs of organized criminal to acquire&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Its cocaine dependence led to a hopeless Kompromittierung and made it impressionably for the subjects of leading members of the organized crime, that delegated it to overtake valuable information about police ascertainments.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Lawyers must maintain the highest standards at integrity and must provide in the public for confidence and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Ditta deceived this confidence and tries to take cover behind the facade of its occupation.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the ascertainments against Ditta, that led also to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and justice handicap, what underlines our determination to bring criminal before court.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This case should be criminal a warning and shows that the arm of the law evade can from no.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We find you and bring before court.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough itself was convicted to 14 years prison after he had declared himself to the heroin trade, cocaine trade and cannabis trade to be indebted to the plot.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Thirty-five further people involved at the drug trade were convicted to entire punishments by 153 years because of drug offense.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On its websites, Ditta published would be an area with questions and answers over itself, in which it indicated, its dream job it when lawyer to represent client in the death cell in America, its given as an ultimatum guest in the supper would be Mohammed Ali and chance inequality would be the motivation for its work.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Is the train transition costly supposed to be rebuilt &quot;at the deer&quot; in order to increase the traffic security?</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yes, the local councils concluded.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Schiltach must take for that 220,000 Euro into the hand.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Germans train the Kinzigtal track wants to improve in the coming year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Especially the security is supposed to be increased at the same time at train transitions - regularly comes it nationwide to collision of trains with other vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="6">If the communities agree the reconstruction measures, they must be involved with one-third in the costs, divide the remainder itself train and alliance.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Schiltachs city master builder Roland Grießhaber clarified the local council the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs &quot;at the deer&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There the city plans to construct an Ausbuchtung in height of the tunnel mouth there west of the tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There also larger vehicles, for example such that transport long wood could stand, in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Grießhaber proposed therefore to construct a required support wall so that the city could the subsequent street to given time distributors in order to guarantee a smooth traffic river.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This controversially was discussed in the local council, pulled there some Räte the necessity of a street distribution in doubt: Thomas slag heap brought the mood of the critics with its remark on the point: Must we &quot;take&quot; so much money because of so few vehicles into the hand?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The train transition &quot;deer&quot; would be used regularly for long wood carriers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Even wood out of the area &quot;cow stream&quot; would be transported partially over this stretch because that could not use the stretch until vehicles long to 20 meters at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main street.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In addition the stretch serves as an Umleitungfür those vehicles that may not use the tunnel, if the main street is blocked, Haas argued.</seg>
		<seg id="15">To see there be that Kirchberg- and lock mountain tunnel rebuilt and rehabilitates become must how this is presently in Wolfach the case, could approach the train transition &quot;at the&quot; deer&quot; also for a longer period an important traffic meaning.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The Räte agreements let examine, which would cause costs the angedachte widening of the street.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Without regard to its was agreed by a majority with the standard that the required support wall is constructed so, with the reconstruction of the train transition that the city could expand the subsequent street direction &quot;railway station street&quot; if necessary for encounter traffic on approximately 5.5 meter.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The reconstruction of the train transition in the tannery Trautwein could stretch on the other hand an entirely other problem after, concerns that the driveway into the strongly increasing &quot;Geroltzhäuser way&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The administration had examine let the reconstruction plans of the train of the engineer office Breinlinger because it had doubt on that, whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser of way would be further possible then yet without.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The investigation concluded that not to exclude would be, that the inclination ratios of the street could lead in addition, that longer vehicles rest.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The responsibility for this carries again the city as a road construction load carrier.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The reconstruction could stretch accordingly liability disputes after.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Because both the wood removal and the turning in the current extension condition functioned, one should not agree with the reconstruction of the train transition, argued Haas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Also let the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition be here clearly slighter than at the other train transitions because directly beside it the stop point middle would be, to which a good line of sight would exist.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even trains of the central station here should have been braked here already so far that no collision would threaten.</seg>
		<seg id="26">By a majority the approval was denied the reconstruction of this train transition because the city Schiltach could withdraw the problem with resting vehicles &quot;bathe from must&quot;, so the Räte, because the train after conclusion of the structural work out of the responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As unproblematic observed the group that rebuilt at the train transitions &quot;before hay stream&quot; and &quot;before cow stream&quot;, for which already intersection agreements with the train were encountered.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: Faster adult become</seg>
		<seg id="1">Afroamerikanische and hispanische girl tend to reach sooner puberty than its white age comrades how investigations show.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical variations do not mean yet directly puberty</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no record that hormone or other chemicals are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe, the epidemic obesity would be a trigger of the early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend to the early puberty is stamped fewer with boy</seg>
		<seg id="6">The earlier CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specialized in child health and family subjects.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Should a mother be provided if its daughter already in the age of seven or of eight years breasts and shame hairs grow?</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the annual conference of the pediatrician association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, explained the pediatric Endokrinologe Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical variations would be relatively normally under American girls and represented a new standard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend much time therewith, parents to calm – normally is that no sign, that now quickly puberty enters&quot;, clarified Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious notices of the development how for example growing breasts, shamed hairs and shoulder hairs as well as body smell, appear with girl earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Nevertheless there was only an easy postponement in the age of the Menarche (appearance of the first rule hemorrhage) in the last 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age is about 12.5 years, something less than 12.75 in the year 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;If the development of the breasts begins, takes it longer at least two to three years to the Menarche&quot;, said Kaplowitz, also author of the book &quot;early puberty with girl: The essential counselor to the contact with this frequently appearing problem&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most exact test how puberty yelled at before.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is disputed, what represents actually the start of puberty, but it counts &quot;precocious&quot; if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before an age by eight years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something, that a pediatrician exactly supervise can.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In faster ahead step, tests could be indicated by an Endikronologen so that serious problems such as Tumore or cysts can be excluded.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and the defense another consequence: the premature aging of the bones that can lead as an ultimatum to growth inhibition and therewith small body growth with adult.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations for a medicinal or hormonelle therapy orient themselves towards the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is reservedly, what concerns medicines, but it clears: &quot;the suppressing of puberty can behavior problems and the feelings of girl soften, unlike its age comrade to be&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other large problem is intelligible: Parents would not want simply that its very young daughters have the period.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;You provide yourself because of the pregnancy risk or about, like it the hygienic side handle&quot;, said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock&quot;, remembers a woman whose daughter with ten got its days.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Also if there were first signs and had spoken we over menstruation, emotionally was not prepared it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It came frightens and excited of the school home because it was that not until its circle of friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many comprehensively published theories over the causes of premature puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">No conclusive proofs exist yet for that that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causal.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Boy come similar to girl earlier into puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz is convincing would be the view, that premise the epidemic of the obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It supported the execution of a study in 2001 over girl in the age of six to nine years, who produces a context between body fat and the entrance into puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, afroamerikanische and hispanische girl reach tendency sooner puberty than its white age comrades.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are for that different explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Globally an early puberty of all possible things seems influenced to be, of economy conditions over the climate to the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">A further riddle: Although boy the face hair and shame hair already earlier are awake, the trend to a complete earlier puberty is not stamped so like with girl.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other physicians on the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the subject.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The emerging of Akne and pubic hair is spread even in baby and infants.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We must be careful, like we the true start of puberty identify&quot;, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric Endokrinologe at the Goryeb Children's it hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to be advised of its pediatrician how they should speak with its child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;That can mean, that one earlier than an expected a conversation lead must&quot;, advised Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If one remains quiet, the child reacts normally good.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girl, who early erblühen, need the insurance, that is the process a normal part of life, even if it enters thought earlier than.</seg>

		<seg id="6">Does if user &quot;Anna&quot; send at &quot;Benni&quot; a mail, the computers of both then directly are connected?</seg>
		<seg id="7">The e-mail-program or the browser of Anna sends the mail in the first step at the mail server of its service provider.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Two YMCA colleagues out of New South whale (NSW) had been accused because of sexual offense in the context with children before 2011 accusations against the pediatric nurse Jonathan lord were raised out of Caringbah, how the royal commission learned for sexual abuse of children.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yet in the opening explanation before the commission, the YMCA had explained, one had had&quot; to never to do &quot;in the organization with an occurrence of sexual child abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Manager Phillip Hare was questioned over a case, with which a YMCA colleague had been accused because of offense with child pornography, and another with which a sport teacher of children entrusted to the YMCA Caringbah hall 1991 because of the abuse it had been convicted.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Hare said Gail Furness, one of the commission of assisting lawyer that it had known of the first case, that not however had known second.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It cleared had been, the opening explanation of the YMCA vis-à-vis the commission also inexact in the statement, &quot;it would have external examinations of the YMCA given, in which the YMCA as at frontmost front in the child security acknowledged became&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Proofs before the commission show rather that the YMCA was instructed about that, that it received the second lowest estimation of four possible in a quality audit of the department of Education and Communities (upbringing ministry) in August the year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hare, that began with 21 in the YMCA, cleared would have fails and not guaranteed, the management &quot;of me at downward&quot; in the attitude of lord that colleagues had been himself over its obligations in the clear to report offences against the guidelines to the child security.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Lord had been convicted beginning of the year because of sexual offense at twelve boys during its two-year activity for the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It was convicted to at least six years prison.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Hare contested however that the YMCA would have a cultural problem, that colleague had held off therefrom to report lord offences with regard to the security of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The colleagues stated, they would have observed offences, looked after among other things that lord was alone with children, it privately as a babysitter, sit let it on its lap, said to one that he would have it dearly, and let play children with its mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was lord and had asked that for a training to the child protection, because it was provided because of its behavior, stated that the child service leader Jacqui Barnat, that was in the YMCA Caringbah the superior lord, &quot;very intimidating and most time very unapproachable was&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The manager explained, he would not accept statements of colleagues according to what these would not have trusted itself to return its superior message.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Instead, so it said, had impaired rather its friendship with lord its judgment fortune why they would not have reported it.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hare explained, it had announced its view to the board of directors of the YMCA NSW that the lesson, that has to pull the organization out of the „Jonathan-Lord-Zwischenfall&quot;, would not concern, &quot;the reporting&quot; through colleague, and the board of directors had agreed with it.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The tour begins very unspectacularly: &quot;We catch in the underground garage at&quot;, says Schulze.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car just city, and therefore only that remained stand of the remainders of the old city wall, what was not too large.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Most users of the park house hurry therefore today also at the Roman remnants past and turn down only its car.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: European divestiture gives the scot the choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">A new day, a new fright story to the independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required in order to join the Schengen room as a condition for the EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">That delivers the cue for stories over passport inspection in Berwick and one with barbed wire secured boundary along the Hadrianswalls.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In the deed was referred in the Strathclyde model to the possible economic advantages, played, that would bring more trip freedom in the remaining Europe with itself, but this – as expected – in the headlines no role.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Also no one mentioned that the EU member countries bend right themselves frequently its strict rules, if it more favorably is for it.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Because Scotland does not belong presently to the Schengen room, the continued non-observance would be for Brussels only a small concession in return for that, what one wants really of the scot.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Therefore actually no story.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And a, that came already so in the years, that it is similar to already a fossil: I heard the first time the &quot;independence meant passport inspection&quot; -duck before at least 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At the same time an interesting point gets lost in the permanent repeating of this age old story.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should one expect of an independent Scotland that it dances after the European pipe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why do the Londoner yoke against that of Brussels exchange, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Those are the actual European novelties: The large after which war run is plan calm to the union of Europe into the coring.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the Euro crisis, the project Europe officially died.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Everywhere in the EU, parties win at ground, that EU hostily are or would like to throw the Euro as a common currency over board.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Euro sceptical party was able to manage to grab alternative for Germany – first this year established – tightly five million voices in the Bundestag election in September for itself and was able to banish therewith effectively the free democrats (that equivalently to the British liberally Democrats) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There was already always domestic resistance against the plan, to create a federalist Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The current economic crisis turns out to be sure as a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Because of the cost-cutting policy imposed severe by Berlin and the European central bank in connection with the compulsion jacket, in which the respective national economy is compelled by the adherence to the joint currency, are many people of the view, the project Europe would be to far gone.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the Euro has to do few therewith that national governments cause excessive budgets deficits – that was only in Greece the case.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Instead the Euro system nailed its members on exchange rates, advantageously are that for German exporters – and that would like to let German politicians gladly so.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe with an incorporated productivity disadvantage regains itself vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The single possibility exists therein to shorten wages and public editions – encouraged of Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the current budget problems and currency problems, a deep going European productivity problem lies.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a consequence of the energy guidelines decreed &quot;green&quot; by Brussels – a code for the subsidizing More french and German energy businesses at the expense of consumer –, the European industry pays compared the double for electricity and the fourfold to the United States for gas.</seg>
		<seg id="25">That is some paralyzing costs disadvantage how we were able to see already in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All wage festival spellings of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry before that to be pressed of cheap American slate gas into the corner.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a consequence, a revolt pulls up, especially in France, the former Cheerleader of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle, with which one hold Germany in chess and Paris was able to lift at eye level with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Yet Berlin needs Paris no longer as a gate to the political authorization and pressed Europe its own economic policy wherewith the marred French economy has to fight.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result: Navy Le Pens of to the right arranged, EU hostile front nationally won just a decisive after choice and referred therewith the reigning socialists to place three.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The front the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes nationally is now – a timely warning for the British Labour party that it cannot assume, a split in the right spectrum would mean automatically advantages for the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What does Le Pen make with its newly won popularity under the white Frenchman of the worker class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">It would like to use the EU choices next year in addition, an Anti EU-to forge Anti common currency block in the European parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the Anti-EU-parties in these choices well cut off – and that is very well possible –, could dominate for the first time such a block the European parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is the point on which I want out: In not all too furthermore future, the growing resentment against the EU and the joint currency will meet itself to the abolition of the Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it will become sooner something akin to the &quot;Europe of the (sovereign) nations&quot;, that general favored de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and a couple of its satellite economies hold perhaps at the Euro firmly, but France and southern Europe will return to its own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that Great Britain of this project dissociates itself in the hope to ingratiate myself in the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="39">To be sure interest growing in the Pacific room suggests Washington that Great Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Where does Scotland remain in all that?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can decide to be a region of (in last consequence) small England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests – why also belonged to say Berlin and Brussels, what they can stick there itself where.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I assume, Scotland could go in a looser European association very well as far as we retain our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The cooperation with other, similarly thinking countries is simpler in a not federate Europe of the nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise we should consider, should retain it Norway gleichzutun and our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkable would prove – the most successful political movement against the cost-cutting policy in Europe and won 2011 a spectacular majority based on the rejection of the proposed (and undertaken) abridgments, that the Labour treasury Ministers had to take responsibility for Alistair Darling and the following Tory Lib the coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be for Scotland laughable to decide now on an independence, to got forced only around then of Berlin and Brussels a cost-cutting policy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: Passengers can use now electronic devices in airplanes (however no mobile phone conversations lead)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Flight travelers can hear now its electronic devices from the take-off to the landing for reading, works, games, music and can use the appearance of films, telephone not however with the mobile phone, so the new guidelines that were published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation administration (FAA) in the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yet the passengers should not expect that these changes are transferred immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly they would implement, would depend on the respective airline, explained FAA colleague Michael Huerta on a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The airlines must prove the FAA that airplanes correspond to the new guidelines and that they updated the training handbooks of the flight personnel as well as the regulations for the stowing of the devices corresponding to the new directions.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA explained, it had received already of some airlines plans, that would like to expand the use of portable electronic devices in airplanes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Under these airlines, also delta and JetBlue were.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;According to condition of the plan could we the expanded utilization of electronic devices very soon approve&quot;, announced the FAA in an announcement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Presently passengers must disengage Smartphones, Tablets and other devices if the airplane doors are closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They may start it first then again if the airplane reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In the entrance in the country approach, the passengers must disengage it again and may start it not again before the airplane landed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">After the new guidelines, airlines, whose airplanes against electronic interferences would be certain, could to use its passengers permit, the devices also in start, landing and on the roll field, explained the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most new traffic airplanes and other flyers, who were converted for the use by Wi Fi in larger heights, should correspond to the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the occupation association of professional flight companion, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;If the new regulation certainly transferred is – and we work relating to this closely with the airline together –, become both side therefrom profit&quot;, commented on Glading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We honestly are said it sorrow to have to feel at this subject such as overseer.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nevertheless Internet connections for surfing, exchanges of e-mails, text messages or downloading of data remained forbidden under three kilometers further, clarified the authority.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers are requested, Smartphones to transfer Tablets and other devices in the flight mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Therefore still no &quot;Word With Friends&quot;, that Scrabble resembling Online game, that the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 played on its Smartphone, when he had to leave public effective a jet of American airlines, because he refused to disengage the device while the airplane was parked at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices such as laptops must be stowed also further because here an injury danger exists, if they fly by the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mobile phone conversations during the flight remain forbidden also further.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The regulation competence for telephone conversations is not about the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA cancels possibly ban for certain electronic devices in start and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Mark Rosenker of the traffic security authority said last month nationally Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national traffic questions on CBS News, mobile phones would be regarded yet always as a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Mobile phone are actual a problem, not only because it potentially interferences in navigation devices cause could, but rather because we of the FCC know, that the transmission out of the air also envoy mast disturb can&quot;, so Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">A consultation committee of the industry, that was called by the FAA to the investigation of this subject into life, recommended last month that the government would permit a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In the last years, the pressure increased to the FAA to relax restrictions for the use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critic such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill out of Missouri represent would be the view, there no valid safety reasons for the ban.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions are to be put through also increasingly more heavily because the utilization of the devices became omnipresent.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In some studies, the speech, that forgets or ignores to one-third of the passengers the disengaging of the device, is therefrom.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA began 1966 to restrict the utilization of electronic devices through flight traveler after reports had become on interferences of navigations and communication devices through UKW radios carried by passengers well known, that at that time the newest technology trend represented.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New airplanes are by far more dependent on electric systems as earlier generations of aircrafts, but they are constructed also so and approves by the FAA that them electronic Interferenzen settle nothing.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines have offered already for some years Wi Fi to passengers if the altitude is reached.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The flyers adapted at Wi-Fi-systems are also more insensible vis-à-vis Interferenzen.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The predominant majority of the passenger airplanes should be suited for the stronger use of electronic devices after the new guidelines, said Huerta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The current electronic devices give in general substantially less radio radiation from than earlier generations.</seg>
		<seg id="36">E Reader for example deliver only minimal radiation if one turns over.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Yet in the downloading or sending of data, the transmission values are stronger.</seg>
		<seg id="38">To the advocates of a loosening of the restrictions for the device utilization through passengers, Amazon. com counts.</seg>
		<seg id="39">2011 loaded firm colleague of Kindle E Reader full a passenger airplane and made a test flight in order to determine problems, were able to assess however none.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the FAA consultation committee expressed mixed feelings what concerns the risk in regards to the utilization of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd of the passenger association nationally Association of airline Passengers said would be would be, it the view, the interference through the devices real, also if the risk would be minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other committee members said, there would be would be only isolated reports of pilots, that would speak for an interference about airplane systems through the devices, and that therefrom very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The committee recommended the FAA to be sure to permit it pilots, to arrange the disengaging of the devices in instrument landing under bad visibility ratios through the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A grouping out of the trip industry welcomed the changes and designated it as a sensible adaptation for traveler, who would be equipped today extensively with technology.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We please us, that the FAA recognizes, that a comfortable passenger experience not in the contradiction to the security stands&quot;, said Roger Dow, CEO of that Travel Association U.S.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;We want the inhabitants prematurely into the planning bind&quot;, opened mayor Jens Häußler the citizen information organization to the flood protection draft in Gechingen.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Approximately 80 participants had come into the community hall in order to be explained the planned measures, to ask questions, to express objection and to bring in ideas.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Häußler placed clearly: &quot;That in the end decisions fällen the members of the local council&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The flood, the Gechingen on the 15th of May 2009, unprepared encountered, had been an incisive event, that raised ask that about precaution for the future, so Häußler.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A river zone investigation had been given with the neighbor community Aidlingen in order, that is now base for the flood protection draft in Gechingen.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The protection if possible many cultivated plots of land is the goal&quot;, so Häußler.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Bottom put is the protection from a year statistical every 100 according to Germans weather service to expecting floods the planning.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The climate variation taken into account through a 15-percent extra charge.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In circles of experts, this is designated with &quot;HQ 100aKlima&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The water measures, that had led 2009 in Gechingen to considerable damages, corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;An absolute protection gives it not, but a relative improvement can we obtain&quot;, so Häußler.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In order to obtain the protection HQ 100aKlima, must invest become in Gechingen approximately Four Million Euro whereby the community can reckon with country subsidies in height of approximately 70 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Häußler referred however on that that there only would be the support, if a total concept would be transferred.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Jumbo manufacturers fight in the face of large orders over seat width</seg>
		<seg id="1">Between leading airplane manufacturers, it came to a discussion over the width of seats in the tourist class in long-range flights, what indicates the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubais Airshow this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute revolves offered becomes around the seat width, the passengers in long flights in the tourist class – always that around which airlines strive most, but this expelled room does not place SOW the key for the efficiency statements in the newest airplanes of Airbus and Boeing Co. there.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus demanded says this week an industry standard, that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18-inch) in the tourist class, but the US American archrival Boeing, the airlines should decide that.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The discussion comes at a time because the airplane manufacturers to sell therefore rivalries, even larger versions of its zweimotorigen long-range flyers, and expect at the organization of that 17th until 21st of November of record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">How the rear part of the airplane arranged is – especially whether it rows with nine or ten seats gives –, is decisively for the indicated economic results, that should deliver the new &quot;mini jumbo&quot; -to design.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing maintains, its modernized &quot;777X&quot; would grasp 406 people in seats in the tourist class, that extend are over 17-inch and permit so ten per row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus explains, the competing version of the A350 conveys 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class whereby there are nine per row.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Airplane giants distribute frequently blows over technical details by means of advertising in the specialty press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now Airbus appeals before the Dubais Airshow where the 777X with more than 100 orders will make presumably the race, directly at the public.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Did recently the business introduce a notice, that could be the start of a new notice war and showed financier a picture, in which three people sit bruised together in a restaurant, and in addition the title: &quot;would become you that accept&quot;?</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing strikes long-range flights in seats before, that are narrower than regional Turbo Props&quot;, says Airbus sales and marketing boss John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In view of changed eating, habits become the people thicker, but airplane seats did not change radically.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970ern when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-range trip, and the end of the century the weight of the masculine average American between 40 and 49 years increased around ten percent, so the data of the US health ministry.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The waist circumference of the masculine average American in the 21st century amounts to 100.8 cm according to US American health statistics.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus says, its rival would comply with a seat draft out of the 1950ern when the average body circumference of the freshly baptized &quot;jet Set&quot; more narrowly was.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Have, so Airbus, investigations carried out, that covered, that a (2.54 cm additional customs would increase) per seat the sleep quality around 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing challenges the numbers of Airbus to the seat measures and says, it stands to not to decide in the estimating of the manufacturers how airlines form the balance between flight tariffs and arrangement.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The business explains would hang also, according to investigations the experience in the airplane of more than the seat width off.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It runs really on that out, airline flexibility to give, so that it that do can, what it in its opinion must, around successful to be&quot;, clarifies the flight cabin experts Kent Craver of Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They would not want that we dictate them, what makes it profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know its business better than every other.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, it concerns more elbow freedom, but for manufacturer, it becomes in increasing mass of a subject, that can affect the revenues.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the discussion, a race stands around airplane orders with an appreciated volume of at least 700 billion U.S. dollars after Listenpreisen in the coming decades, what could affect persistently the export balances of the USA or Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">How Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving power behind the discussion around the new jets.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in its newest zweimotorigen long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, that 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The statements Boeings on the results depend partially therefrom that the 777X with its ten seats is compared per row to the original design by nine seats in the 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The increased costs per unit are always even slighter than in presently related machines with ten seats per row.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Boeing bruises therefore more seats into its airplane, around it more competitive to our products to make&quot;, says Kevin Keniston, leader for passenger comfort in the European Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand analysts, full cabins with ten seats say pointed per row in available 777s on that there that many passengers decided on the narrower arrangement, what could walk with cheap flight tariffs.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Eighteen-inch seat width would be crazy for passengers, but the reality is: of an economic viewpoint out of is the Airbus offer of the threat through the 777 driven&quot;, says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin arrangement, founder and publisher of Runway Girl network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but rather a catalogue of supplier out of which the airlines can select.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The world traveling jets salesmen carry even tape measure with itself, around which to check arrangement in the competition.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Even if they extol the comfort, all manufacturers offer yet also jets with highly condensed arrangement for cheap airline and regional flights.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen rows, sold however yet none according to own statements.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently Airbus emphasized how importantly more Anpassbarkeit of the cabins would be and offered for some jets wide seats at the gears.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only jet large modern other manufacturer, experts say that the call probably would explode after a new industry standard, but could distract by the wave of 777X-Verkäufen.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Veganismus is imputes according to lexicons the Vegetarismus, differs of this however yet on entirely considerable manner.</seg>
		<seg id="1">For during vegetarian permit itself the consumption of creme pie, ice or a strong Edamer, stand these feast eggs not on the menu of a vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Milk, cheese, egg, next to the renunciation of meat and fish the vegan of the product animal all consumption lets from - also honey is denied.</seg>
		<seg id="3">One likes to ask himself what remains,, but in nearer view, the vegane nourishment world draws itself through a notable ingenuity from.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Spreads are very chooses&quot;, explains Ute handle man, that proprietor of the local health food shop, who has ready a multitude of special products for vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Also Proctor rubbed visits the store in the cathedral lane gladly.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For 13 years the native New Zealander vegan lives finds, in Lampertheim he (almost) all before, what he needs for life. I shifted &quot;1997 my nourishment and became vegetarian&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Around the century turning point resulted then the next step and I vegan became.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;The conviction came however not only because of the nourishment, but rather based on the shoe choice&quot;, says Proctor, that art leather prefers leather normal.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It recognized that it goes also in other daily concerns without animal products.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Primarily vegan is its ethics one.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I wants not, that animals for me die must&quot;, speaks Proctor the maxim of the vegans from, that extends on the entire consumption behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mourn afterwards instead of castles, scrambled egg or Gummi Bears, had discovered climbed the vegan products quickly entirely new, the enthusiasm on.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;It is a double bonus&quot;, says Proctor today, &quot;actually places vegan its no renunciation, no asceticism there, but rather it is an enrichment&quot;. The acceptance that one would reduce the selection with the nourishment transposition at food option, attributes Proctor sooner to the power of the habit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And exactly these conditionings let fail also many a yet so well meant attempt.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The Suchtfaktor is an entirely decisive factor, that many quickly abandon lets, similarly in the smoking&quot;, places Proctor a comparison up.</seg>
		<seg id="16">And objects: &quot;Certain Geschmäcker are not to be fastened&quot; at the animal.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Often the spices or the type of the preparation that settle the taste are it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;One can however also in other manner the same effect produce&quot;, clarifies the vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="19">To a grill festival, Proctor brings along for example eggplant, mushroom and also a couple Veganwürste.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It pays attention to a well-balanced, varied nourishment, with which it thoroughly also once heftily should taste.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Naturally one would like to have something between the teeth, is that legitimate.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;It should taste, but that is not only on animal nourishment to reduce&quot;, so Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Health damages up to eating disorders, a further widespread acceptance, had not suffered it.</seg>
		<seg id="24">For me, the transposition had a positive aspect.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I receive no strange cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are high performance athletes who eat excluding vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;My blood values are best, I let me often check&quot;, betrays Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Especially before the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;There animals with lining means nourished become, instead of on the meadow grasses, is it questionably, whether in the meat, that one in the cool trunk buys, the Vitamin-B12-Anteil is high&quot;, finds Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For vegan, there is moreover the possibility to take the Coenzym in the form of tray to itself.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;My B12-Werte are in order&quot;, explains it.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Proctor didn't have to go far ways for the food procurement.</seg>
		<seg id="33">There is reason food in the end everywhere and every supermarket has meanwhile soya bean milk and other products.</seg>
		<seg id="34">All what I need, I find on the spot.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Only off and at I buy something special.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Many people survey that just only the finished products are expensive, but so it behaves in&quot; usual&quot; finished products of course also&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Anyway let the preparation be vegan of courts by far more favorable and less time-consuming when commonly supposed.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;In the house kitchen gives it much to discover, with a couple of small pinched can one good, if not partially better results obtain&quot;, says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Margarine instead of butter, somewhat more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its veganen cheesecakes Proctor was able to bring also its Schwiegereltern for marveling.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The vegan lends would spice family festivals a new.</seg>
		<seg id="41">That has dynamics if one cooks together, has the one new status.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;The situations, that at the same time emerge can, are as different as the people themselves&quot;, says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Naturally scepticism was offered it however also already.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Does my meal taste you no longer?</seg>
		<seg id="45">Should I &quot;now badly feel because I drink&quot; milk? - In questions such one had to act as a vegan with fingertip feeling.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;I lean the people not off, I am part of this company&quot;, would like Proctor no enclave existence time periods.</seg>
		<seg id="47">And more exactly observed the everyday life world appears then not at all so veganfremd such as assumed - and the vegan not so in the everyday life restricted supposed how commonly.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Also almost Food is permitted.</seg>
		<seg id="49">There is fry everywhere!</seg>
		<seg id="50">&quot;Many Dönerläden offer Falafel on, or just a vegetarian Yufka&quot;, says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In a pizzeria, it switches over to Pastagerichte, or a pizza without cheese, all one question of the habit orders just.</seg>
		<seg id="52">The restaurants adjust themselves so slowly on that.</seg>
		<seg id="53">&quot;As I 13 years ago begun still would have, me vegan to nourish, was all much more hard&quot;, foundly can make the New Zealander a development: &quot;One must speak with the people, make&quot; it aware.</seg>
		<seg id="54">&quot;If sufficient demands come, are it perhaps in addition tended, the menu to supplement&quot;, hopes it.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Vegane restaurants develop, like for example the Kombüse in Mannheim or the café bird free.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Proctor cultivates the wish that also other restaurants have stand at least a veganes court on the menu.</seg>
		<seg id="57">In the reason taken are vegane courts for everyone there.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Everyone can eat it, they are therefore exactly the opposite of exclusive.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Meat courts are on the other hand exclusive, and to be sure in the truest sense of the word, for it conclude other from&quot;, places Proctor firmly.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;If one groceries scandals avoid wants, is certain Veganismus a way, the very largest part from the start impossibly to make&quot;, says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="61">The purchase vegan products could be somewhat difficult however at the beginning.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Especially if one learns to understand, the additive animal also into peanuts as a color giver his contain can, seems to leave one with the compliance with the ethics in so many hurdles and falling quickly the courage.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Not only therefore have rubbed Proctor and Lars Thomsen a book written: &quot;Veganissimo - animal ingredients and its alternatives&quot; explains the many ingredients that are buried food however also cleaner.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot;Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows has&quot; is to be done to pay attention to which signs and Logos one it sometimes better small steps as to stumble remain standing or&quot;, knows Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="65">The Veganismus, it an important moral tip-off that strikes on the consciousness is.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Perhaps it does not create it entirely that one discards its habits, but it at least can teach the consumer to examine its habits critically.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists developed an Anti-nicotine-vaccine, that could ruin the joke at the smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice a life long against smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Before tests at the person, even further attempts are required, what can last a few more years, but professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said, the first results would be good.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We are very hopeful, that this type of vaccinate strategy once millions of smokers help can, that tried have to stop and there all methods available on the market tries have, but experience must, that its smoking is stronger than these extensions&quot;, so Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was changed so, that it contains the genetic information to the manufacture of nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus infects selective the liver cell that produce then a permanent current of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize it before they reach the brain, by what means a smoker no nicotine High learns.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In attempts, vaccinated mice which nicotine was dispensed retained, its normal activity level.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mice without vaccination on the other hand would have taken a &quot;time out&quot;, declared the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The experiments are described in the specialist journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibody.</seg>

		<seg id="5">Frontier speaker Kate O' Malley said to move the fee of 100 U.S. dollars would aim on that off, traveler, to attend in the forefield to the payment.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We would want this sum do not calculate&quot;, explained it.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines began 2008 therewith to demand fees for the first and second abandoned baggage piece.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers that tried to go around this, so much plugged therefore like possible into the carry-on luggage, what has as a consequence, that the baggage specialties frequently is overfilled over the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees are a possibility to move passengers in addition, to take fewer with on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O' Malley said, would go in the new fee it not really therefore to earn money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It concerns the most faithful customers of Frontier, who would have expressed clearly, that it would become more heavily and more heavily to find place in the specialty over the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers, that buy your tickets on the websites of the airline, don't have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">That means that a passenger may bring a baggage piece at the gate of Frontier under circumstances free of charge, that next person must pay however 100 dollars for a comparable baggage piece.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O' Malley explained, that changed would become website of Frontier and the Check-in-procedure, so that the passengers would be informed about the fee, before they would come to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The new carry-on luggage fee of Frontier steps not until the summer effective, gives an exact date it not yet.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers scold frequently over baggage extra charges and other fees, but airlines grasp gladly on that back.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that the carrier of the baggage money would cost and passengers should pay these services, if they wished it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many at the Wall Street regard the new baggage fees as a sign that the airline enough money take in in order to cover after years the losses the costs of flight trips.</seg>
		<seg id="19">That let until now however the fingers of fees for carry-on luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit airline inc. demanded three years ago as the first fees for carry-on luggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a no-frills airline.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Let the only other airline with such a fee be the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline adviser Jay Sorensen that the addition fees pursues attentively.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It appreciated in a report from December 2011 that the carry-on luggage fee Spirit would bring in annually 50 million US dollar.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, that earlier a lead possessed in Midwest airline, flew recently with Spirit and was curious, what would expect it at the gate, if passengers would be confronted with the unusual carry-on luggage fee of the business.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The Boarding process belonged to the smoothest, that I in my course in the aviation experienced would have&quot;, said it.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected, Zähneknirschen and hand grasp would laugh to see discussions at the gate.</seg>

		<seg id="30">US Airways had tried 2008 short-term to demand for refreshment drinks money, made this however seven months later again annulled after passengers had burdened themselves and no other large company was done likewise.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Frontiers step to raise fees for the carry-on luggage if passengers do not buy directly in the airline, is the youngest initiative, with which customers on the own websites directed will should.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay Online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per sold ticket.</seg>
		<seg id="33">That delivers a stimulus to move passengers to the direct purchase with them instead of over an Online travel agency to all companies.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Frontier went in this area to be sure furthest.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September the business began therewith to forgive only half so many much flyer miles in entry over an Online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday the miles were shortened once again to 25 percent the flight stretch.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The billionaire and delegate Clive Palmer says, prime minister Tony Abbott would stand in a conflict of interest in its plans to the parents vacation because its daughters could become pregnant and could profit therefore therefrom.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The mining magnate, that is in a judicial discussion over the payment of 6 million dollars at CO2-Steuer, set up the statement when he wanted to wipe questions of the table, whether he would be in a conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Palmer united party could control up to four voices in the senate, that are important to the decision, whether the CO2S are painted or shortened- and mining tax.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Yet Palmer maintained that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters would profit from Abbott personally of the laws.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;He is in a large conflict of interest, if it around paid parents vacation goes, for if one its daughters pregnant becomes, has he a direct interest on that, whether it vacation receives or not&quot;, said Palmer.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Distant planets, gravitation waves or black holes - experts of the European space flight agency must agree now on two large projects, that want to start it in the next years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">30 suggestions stood are to the selection, five yet in the race.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Distant worlds.</seg>
		<seg id="4">More than 1000 planets in other stars already found astronomer.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Whether there is life at least on some of them, knows no.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The selection falls heavily: Should one search for gravitation waves?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Investigate or rather the origin of the cosmos?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Search or after earth similar planet and discover therewith perhaps extraterrestial life?</seg>
		<seg id="9">These questions stand just the responsibles of the European space flight agency Esa.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For its program &quot;Cosmic vision&quot; they seek ideas for two large space flight projects, that should advance the cause of the research decisively.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The budget for such &quot;L missions&quot; is respectively about about a billion Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The start will be presumable 2028 and 2034.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Beginning of September met in Paris the elite of the European space research in order to discuss suggestions for such missions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">30 ideas were came up for debate, five therefrom now into the narrower choice.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Numerous groups appraise the suggestions, hook at the researchers after.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the next days, a final decision should fall through the scientific program committee.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The Esa selected altogether four large questions, on which the missions of the 2007 initiated program &quot;Cosmic vision&quot; answers should find.</seg>
		<seg id="18">What are the conditions for the origin of planets and life?</seg>
		<seg id="19">The exact processes in the origin of stars out of large gas clouds - and therewith also the origin of planets, that these stars circle - lie still in the proverbial dark.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A large infrared telescope in that all this darkly could permeate.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Does and if a star planets possess, under which circumstances life can emerge there?</seg>
		<seg id="22">In order to investigate this question, the space telescope &quot;Cheops&quot; should start 2017, with which 500 already well known planet systems in our nearer environment more exactly are examined.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The possibilities are limited however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With larger instruments, the astronomers could portray earth similar planets and could analyze even the composition of its atmospheres and search so for &quot;organic markers&quot; : Gases that apply as an indication to biological activity.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How does the solar system function?</seg>
		<seg id="26">Also this question should give last of all information about that, which prerequisites there are for the origin of life.</seg>
		<seg id="27">An important roll plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation outgoing by it with the planet system.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary manner.</seg>
		<seg id="29">With the &quot;solar Orbiter&quot;, the Esa allowed already a mission of the M class (there is the budget about about a half billion Euro) for this question.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The probe should start 2017 and exactly should observe surface and activity of the sun.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Of large interest for the researchers, also Jupiter and its moons are.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They want to find out, whom roll played the giant planet in the development of the solar system.</seg>
		<seg id="33">For that the Esa plans the first of the altogether three L missions of the &quot;Cosmic vision&quot; -program.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The probe &quot;Juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy Moons explorer) begins its trip presumably 2022.</seg>
		<seg id="35">It later reaches eight years Jupiter and should examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.</seg>
		<seg id="36">What are the basic physical laws of the universe?</seg>
		<seg id="37">The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine so, whether that confessed nature laws there still validly are to us.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Perhaps also deviations, that could the physicists the way to a new theory of wise, are found, under whose roof all well known nature laws can be united.</seg>
		<seg id="39">How did the universe emerge and from where it exists?</seg>
		<seg id="40">Before 13.7 billion years, our cosmos was caused by the Big Bang.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Next to matter familiar us, out of the stars, planet and living thing how we exist, gives it dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy pile, and dark energy by whose causing the expansion of the universe speeds up.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Until now the researchers know exist neither, which physical laws in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang were valid, yet from where dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="43">With &quot;Euclid&quot;, the Esa allowed also here already a M mission, whose start is planned for 2020.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With a special telescope, the probe should examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time at the entire sky and should enable so conclusions on the state of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Who could make the race</seg>
		<seg id="46">Of the 30 suggestions will remain at the end of the selection procedure only two remaining.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The best chances for a permission as a L mission &quot;E Lisa&quot;, a demanding draft to the proof of gravitation waves has in the opinion of many experts.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Under that physicists understand changes in the structure of the room time that Albert Einstein had predicted before almost 100 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Proved became it until today not.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Elisa could create that, hope the scientists behind the project.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The mission plans one out of two or three probes existing detector, that becomes all stationed in that.</seg>
		<seg id="52">It could prove in contrast to plants on the earth also gravitation waves, could deliver that emerged in the Big Bang, and so new insights over the origin of the cosmos.</seg>
		<seg id="53">Four further suggestions compete yet around the second L mission: a large x-ray telescope by the name of &quot;Athena&quot; that should investigate among other things black holes, &quot;Icy planet it&quot;, a further mission to the external planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism&quot;, a mission to the measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and that &quot;exoplanet Finder&quot; that earth similar planets should track down and examine.</seg>
		<seg id="54">Already eliminated are suggestions to the rehearsing back carrier of Mars among other things, to the investigation of moon, Venus and asteroid as well as to sun physics.</seg>

		<seg id="1">US American street plans is believe found in search of a money source in order to repair the decaying Highway system, and the solution in a small black box to have, that in the instrument panel of each car place finds.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, that record every gone kilometer and report the information at the authorities, to revise are essential point of a controversial attempt of Washington and the planning offices of the states, the obsolete system of streets US American to the financing.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The zone rather boring normally of the street planning has kindles suddenly an intensive debate with colorful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarian allied and speak itself with environment groups itself for that from that the government can use the small boxes for recording the gone kilometers – and possibly also, where it gone became – and can use the information then for the calculation of tax modest.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Tea party is appalled.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American civil right union (ACLU) is provided also deeply and expresses a row of data protection objection.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Yet during one in the congress on an action do not agree can, wait several states not more long.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They test presently how they can change in the course of the next ten years to a system, with which drivers pay per gone mile.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of drivers already tested the tachographs, of which some with GPS supervision are equipped.</seg>
		<seg id="10">That is must actual a for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It is nothing, that we only possibly use become&quot;, said Hasan Ikhrata, manager of the Southern Californias Assn. of Governments, that plans a record of the gone miles at all Californian drivers in the state from 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The type and manner how we pay these taxes, will change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology for that is there.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The initiative comes at a time because the Highway trust finding that is financed out of the taxes is, that US Americans pays at the gasoline pump, broke.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Yet in America, so much is refueled no longer like earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars consume less gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The national mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Euro cents per liter) did not climb for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians do not venture in high Spritpreisen to raise the tax also only around a cent.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gasoline tax is simply not future capable&quot;, so lee Munnich, an expert for traffic legislation at the university of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Its state equipped recently 500 cars with tachographs, with which a mile been based pay system is supposed to be tested.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;That places the long-termed most meaningful alternative there&quot;, said it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Bureaucrats designate it as a mile been based user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It do not surprise that the idea finds in municipal liberal accord, for the tax could be used for example in addition to influence the driving behavior so that obstruction and climate harmful exhaust fumes are reduced.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Californian plans set on the system in the elaboration of strategies, with which the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state are supposed to be reached to climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Yet the republican Bill Shuster out of Pennsylvania, chairperson of the House Transportation Committee, explained also that he would see therein the most passable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Also the free marketers of the Reason Foundation are done of the idea let pay driver after traversed stretch.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;That is no tax, that in a black hole disappears&quot;, explains Adrian bogs, vice president for guidelines in Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The people pay directly for that, what they get.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is supported also of two earlier American transportation ministers, who had requested the congress in a report in 2011, to move toward mile been based statement.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Year approved last the US senate a pilot project expensive 90 million dollars that would have comprised 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Yet the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the attack and reacted therewith on the objections of delegate out of rural zones, that people represent, who must traverse many miles in the everyday life often on the way to the work or into the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several states and cities move nevertheless independently into this direction.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Most engagly Oregon, that presently 5,000 drivers recruits for the largest experiment of the country, is.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will pay soon the mile fees instead of the mineral oil tax at the state.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada locked already a pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="36">New York city considers also such a.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois tests it in restricted mass with truck.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95-Koalition, to which the transportation ministries of 17 states belong at the east coast, examines presently how one could introduce the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The draft is no universal hit.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada where recently 50 volunteers with the devices were equipped, were driver sceptical in the thought, the government could pursue each of its movements.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Consider against Big Brother and such things were a large problem&quot;, explains Alauddin Khan, leader of the strategy management and result management in the transportation ministry of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The people did not want it.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its websites: &quot;it would be relatively simple, the tachographs into fully grown supervision devices to change&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="44">There was no necessity to construct a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure, that would become inevitable in addition relatedly to grasp data over the daily movements of individual.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada does not belong to a row of states, that hold now after affordable technology lookout, with which the country can grasp the gone kilometers, but exactly when and where.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Therewith, so Khan, would be also the public more calmed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The hunt after this technology led some authorities to a small Startup business by the name of True Mileage in California.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The firm not originally is begun in order to help states in the taxation of drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Rather it was its goal of getting an in a soaring market for motor vehicle insurances foothold, with which drivers should pay on base of the gone miles.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Yet that of its devices of tested are not work also for the street plans interesting, for it with GPS and deliver only limited information that become high loaded regularly per modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;The people are rather ready, itself on that to involve, if its speed and locations not recorded become&quot;, explained Ryan Morrison, manager of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">In some of these public pilot programs, large mistakes were made.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are substantially cheap and less intrusive possibilities to transfer this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, the plans experiment therewith to give drivers a row of choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can for a device with or without GPS decide.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Thousands people of met itself in the center Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the country founder and first President Mozambique in order to tune in a rare public demonstration peace call.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want again peace, we want stability&quot;, said Vanessa de Sousa, manager of an Investment business.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Out of anxiety around the future of the country, it has demand exchanged its business clothing against a T Shirt with the inscription &quot;we security&quot; on Portugese and joined on Thursday the quantity on the independence place of the capital.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks there has been nearly daily report on collisions between government powers and Renamo, that are among the worst combats since the peace agreement before more than 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, that became initial of that of white reigned Rhodesia and later the Apartheitsregierung of South Africa supported in the exertion, to destabilize the independent government of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After the peace contract of 1992, it became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts consider it to be unlikely that the country fall back again into a fully grown conflict, but the youngest events disturbed foreign investors and domestic.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For the quickly growing economy, much stands could on the game, for the discovery of gigantic gas occurrence before the coast and coal warehouse in the northwest investments of more than 50 billion U.S. dollars of firms such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil in the next years, Eni from Italy and Anadarko out of the USA into the country bring.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The reigning Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominating power, and Renamo have given itself mutually the guilt for the tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo maintains, the government had provoked the youngest collisions in that it on the 17th of October its members in the province Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos would have attacked.</seg>
		<seg id="11">That would spread escalated on the earlier rebels, attacked and tried Renamo base than a government troops to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos speaker vis-à-vis the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government gives Renamo the guilt for the collisions and accuses the organization to have attacked soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza tried to deemphasize objection over an instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Opposite AFP, that French news agency, said he on Wednesday that Dhlakama would regard itself as a &quot;loser&quot;, who wants to devote &quot;all its yet remaining energy, in order to prove that he can&quot; force the government its decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they would like to avoid a war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Yet the objections increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gives that peace agreement of 1992 up.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It explained had meant opposite of the FT, therewith it that Frelimo would respect the agreement no longer.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our vision is it, again negotiations to receive and to be sure seriously&quot;, said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Earlier conversations between the parties contributed only few to the settlement of the tensions, that were fueled by a row of collisions this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), that the heads collide&quot;, means Joseph Hanlon, instructor at the opuses University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
		<seg id="21">No of them is is good in the negotiating and none ready to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Renamo that presses on choice reforms already explained, it would boycott the municipal elections in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidency choices and parliament choices are planned for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators interpreted the use of force as the attempt of a kränkelnden movement to obtain concessions and financial privileges of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Renamos choice successes have shrunk since 1992 while a newer party that will improve itself of an earlier Renamo member established Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), probably in the choices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mazanga maintains that Guebuza – its resignation stands, if its second tenure in the next year ends – wanted destroy the democracy of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;It wants no more parties democracy, it wants no transparent choices, it wants no peace, because it the president office do not abandon wants&quot;, so Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is controlled unclear, which capacities Renamo, but it undertook unrest establishing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south-connection.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most combats took place in the province Sofala, that lies several hundred kilometer north of Maputo, in which however Beira is, that harbor, that mountain construction companies such as Rio use Tinto and Vale to the export of coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June Rio interrupted a month long the utilization of the railroad after Renamo had announced an attack on the stretch.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mazanga answered reservedly on the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo wanted &quot;the international partnership warn, that the things in Mozambique not well stand&quot;, said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability yet had increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, leader of Mediacoop, an independent medium business, for many people provided themselves already because of the corruption, the dragging progress in the development and one recently kidnapping wave.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;The people think, that the government and the president for the future of the country are responsible and he that one be should, the solutions for the problems finds&quot;, explains he.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar sultan, a demonstrator, said, the people wanted simply only stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;None interest Renamo and Frelimo, it want simply only again peace and usable streets&quot;, explained it.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The narrowest advisers of Präsident Barack Obama considered in the secret, vice president Joe bathed to replace in the campaign 2012 by Hillary Clinton, so the New York Times.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The uncovering is the remarkableest surprise of the long expected work of mark Halperin and John well-being man over the campaign 2012, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A copy of the soon appearing book exists the Times and it reported on Thursday evening that the Topberater of the president would have carried out &quot;extensive group sessions and surveys end 2011&quot; to find around out whether it better would look fading hope for re-election for Obamas, if he would let bathed fall.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the Times, the book draws thoroughly the story of the efforts of leading colleague the campaign and the white house after, nominally the earlier White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure, which effect it would have on the survey values, to trade the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the vice president.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The potential change was an exertally watched secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the oval Office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only a half dozen of the narrowest advisers of the president – including Daley, the earlier campaign leader Obamas, Jim measuring, and the earlier leading advisers of the white house, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew over the angedachten change.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In &quot;Double Down&quot; is maintained had stood, Daley at the tip of the efforts, bathed to exchange in spite of its &quot;narrow, personal ratio&quot; before one decided in the end against such a gambit, after the data showed, that the candidacy of Clinton would not improve&quot; &quot;the chances Obamas authoritatively.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Daley confirmed in an interview with Martin that the government actually had considered, bathed to replace by Clinton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I expressed a whole series of things, that one in deliberation pull should, and that was one of them&quot;, explained Daley the magazine.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Must one call himself in memory that the president had at that time terrible survey values, therefore we thought: &quot;for God's sake, what make we&quot;?</seg>
		<seg id="11">While Daley designated the investigations as an &quot;offered care&quot;, Martin said vis-à-vis Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for the re-election considerable expense had been operated to find around out whether such a train would pay itself with regard to the choice urns.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;In campaign becomes not so much money for surveys and focus groups issued, if one not seriously over somewhat thinks&quot;, explained Martin on AC360.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It is to be sure not clearly whether Obama knew, that its team thought about an exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Martin said vis-à-vis CNN, it had asked Daley whether its at that time boss would have known over the potential change.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Although Daley explained, it would believe not that himself the president of the possible variation &quot;was aware&quot;, admitted the earlier rod boss, it would be &quot;possible&quot; been that Obama had known therefrom.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Always if it concerns in local council sessions the household, mayor Ralph Gerster has laugh well.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Gemeindesäckl in stove cheeks Schönach is filled well and has known guilt the administration already since 2005 no longer.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Also that fiscal years 2012 can be booked in this sense as a full success.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This became in the presentation of the year calculation for 2012 clear.</seg>
		<seg id="5">How Andrea Rothmund clarified, the administration household with approximately 7.6 Million Euro more highly had fallen out than planned over a million Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Also the excess of the administration household lies with about 1.8 million Euro round a million Euro over the extension.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To owe would be the excess above all higher business tax collections and the community share at the income tax.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Also the fortune household lay again clearly over the planned values.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Instead of the planned 1.5 million Euro, it amounted to 2.5 million Euro in the past year.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;This lies essentially at the higher conveyance out of the administration household&quot;, so Rothmund.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Because in the fiscal year 2012 less investments were handled than planned, also the reserve conveyance more highly fell out.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Altogether the general reserve could be increased around approximately 2.1 Million Euro on now altogether 4.9 million Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and its team for the good work.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Such a work shakes one not simply out of the sleeve&quot;, praised Gerster with view of the year calculation.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It and the local councils were happy evidently about the good numbers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It paradoxically likes to sound, but exactly these good numbers the citizens could come to stand soon expensively.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Through the good financial state, the community in the past was able to forgo high assessments rates.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Through it again subsidies had been shortened however according to Gerster already often by the country.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For these subsidies out of various balance canes, there are prerequisites.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Among other things the cities and communities that apply for subsidies must, certain assessments rates share.</seg>

		<seg id="8">It is named &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; (courage to win) and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas to the presidential election 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">If I am evenings with my patient written records ready and go to bed, me the keep the books back into a time when the politics was able to steal millions inspired and a speech the breath.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The choice perceived held to a landslide victory and newscaster in order to bring to the attention of the historic meaning of this hour.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates cried gathered before joy and my parents all newspapers that were able to find it.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionary was was on the way into the white house and the nation ready for variation.</seg>
		<seg id="13">When at that time 2008 Obama changed into the office, it had approval value of 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then latch I the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">To shift again on the present an evil awakening is as if one is torn out of a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It falls heavily to remember these optimistic times – it seem to be one vaguely memory, a sad admonition at missed possibilities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years since I delivered for the first time my voice, changed actually something.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But it is simple nothing what I would have been able to introduce me.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I acknowledge the magnificent and multilateral things, that Obama reached, of the dismissal of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military deduction out of Iraq, the end of the forced concealing of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Also I am the view that the party-political blockade tactic had tipped over too many strivings, with which our nation should be brought forwards: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay in order to name only some.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Yet after I defended countless times the Obama government vis-à-vis colleagues and acquaintance, I arrived with my explanation attempt at the end.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I reached a point of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The republican blockade politics cannot explain why one allows the monitoring of foreign country chief or the killing of innocent children through drones in overseas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It cannot explain why that gathers nationally Security Agency data over the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower are punished, that disclose national false behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It cannot explain why Anwar al Awlaki, a US American citizen was murdered, without procedure, yet why the public financing boundaries and edition boundaries during the presidential elections gone around become.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It does not justify the results of a report in which it is named, let the exertions of the white house to the immobilization of the media be that &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon government&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="27">And jüngstens cannot excuse it the inability to sketch a simple website in the more than three years since the dismissal of the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know whether it is that, what I should have expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Whether I should have understood with 18, that the government work could contradict that its campaign preceding political.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The delegate office is obvious no foreseeable course because an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre stamp the public discussion.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Yet if I look at the examples named above, they seem selected extensively by the government itself to be.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And that disturbs me most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I selected 2012 again Obama, not because I was enthused over its candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If Romney avoided placed a confusing and unausgegorene alternative there, it did not seem determine its direction and positions to can.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I had, freely of the pressure of future choices, would fulfill the impression, a second tenure for Obama the hope, belong had we of that already so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Yet with the sinking of the approval values for Obama on less than 45% this week the return became into the year 2008 through this book the harder.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It wakes the longing in me after the many promises, that broke up in air.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I read this week a section in the book that describes, how Obama had to put away a heavy loss against Clinton in the areas codes in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In a meeting with the choice helpers after the decision, he said would have to come, it back on course to its colleagues and follow the purpose of its thing.</seg>
