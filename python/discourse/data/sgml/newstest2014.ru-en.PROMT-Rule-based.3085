		<seg id="1">Survived and relatives of 202 dead as a result of explosion of a bomb in Bali in 2002 angrily reacted to the sentence pronounced to the last of conspirators who appeared before the court and declared that Oumar Patek has to be shot.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Began to flow which spent nearly 10 years which are in hiding as one of the most searched people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for its role in creation of the explosive devices used during act of terrorism yesterday.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It can be released within 15 years if receives a conditional early release.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacre as a result of attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist region of Kut during which 202 persons were lost, including 88 Australians, and tens more were wounded.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He was also found guilty on some other the charges, including of a wave of explosions of churches connected with terrorism across all Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prosecutors demanded a life sentence though they could insist that the person nicknamed &quot;demolition man&quot; for the reputation of the master in production of explosive devices has to be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This decision aggravated painful memoirs of mother from Perth with June Kortin who lost the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jannie in the act of terrorism which is carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly ten years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Hardly constraining tears, she told that Patek had to be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I really consider that it has to follow in the footsteps of other guys.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It has to appear before rasstrelny team — Mrs. Kortin AAP told.</seg>
		<seg id="11">— I have to live every day, knowing that I will have no grandsons any more and I will not see my daughters&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Sari club was destroyed when the massive explosive device put in the van parked outside right after the 11th evening was put on October 12, 2002 in action.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was in the bar &quot;Paddy&quot; where the suicide bomber blew up the backpack filled with explosive, only 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="14">After that act of terrorism he for a month felled into a coma and &quot;died&quot; three times, being connected to a life support system.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hughes told that Patek has to share a fate of three other members of a terrorist cell of &quot;Jemaah Islamiyah&quot; responsible for a bloody slaughter — Amrozi, Mukhlas and the Imam Samudra who were executed four years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Really, this guy deserves the death penalty most.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To keep to it life, well, there are no reasons to keep to it life.</seg>
		<seg id="18">To receive 20 years after killed 202 persons and wounded hundreds — it not so much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Began to flow is the last of participants of act of terrorism in Bali who appeared before the court.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He disappeared within nearly ten years, but eventually was detained in January, 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad where the American troops killed the former leader of &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During judicial proceedings the agent of FBI showed that the intelligence data testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in attempt to reestablish communication between terrorist groups of Southeast Asia and &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;He did not give up&quot; — Mrs. Kortin told.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently he did not regret for that at all, how many he grieved other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The sentence is pronounced in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of act of terrorism which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;This year there will be many tears&quot; — Mrs. Kortin speaks.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Power industry of Dnepropetrovshchina began the unique program for rescue... nests of storks</seg>
		<seg id="1">In old times to accustom to the yard of storks, peasants on a high column established a wheel from a cart, and the heavy nest is good on it kept.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Such special support are not put for a long time therefore storks chose columns of power lines - the bound branches lean on wires thanks to what the aistiny lodge costs reliably.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The grandmother Ania near which house in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovsky area years twenty there lives the aistiny family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all efforts of his inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Birds put from above new branches, and the lower layer already gave between wires, just about will fail.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Of course, it is a pity for seven storks who nested every year at a farmstead, removed and brought up for summer of three-four baby birds, but also there is no wish to remain without electricity.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As soon as birds departed to warm regions, the grandmother Ania called in Tsarichansky RES which possesses a support.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And did not even expect that there will react so quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="8">When our experts arrived to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest in general still keeps, - the technical director of DTEK &quot;Dneprooblenergo&quot; Sergey Berezovsky told.</seg>
		<seg id="9">On wires which appeared, in fact, already in the nest weighing 150 - 200 kilograms corrosion began.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At any moment of a bird could be lost from an electric discharge.</seg>
		<seg id="11">And locals risked to remain without electricity because of damage of wires.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Therefore linear adjusters began operation on rescue of a nest, and any more not for the first time in our practice.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Scientists-ornithologists from the Dnepropetrovsk national university who developed the scheme of transfer of a nest helped.</seg>
		<seg id="14">They provided trainings for employees of regional networks.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineering specialists at all stages of reconstruction of nests.</seg>
		<seg id="16">For a start counted that in area in an emergency state there are more than 50 aistiny &quot;apartments&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For their reconstruction the special metal platforms reminding a funnel were welded.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The basis was braided willow branches, and then transferred an old nest there.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis that birds learned a nest and returned to it.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Already then storks will complete the dwelling.</seg>
		<seg id="21">A month ago in the village the Sandwort of the Novomoskovsk area the first nest was reconstructed.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Near an electrosupport put a new ferroconcrete column and placed on it a platform with the old, already rendered habitable nest.</seg>
		<seg id="23">All operation cost to power engineering specialists nine thousand hryvnias.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And the other day the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovsky area on the grandmother Ania's farmstead.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Here the platform was fixed on a former place, only raised over wires.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Ornithologists are sure that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their &quot;apartment&quot; underwent capital repairs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Until the end of the year the same reconstruction expects four more nests in Pokrovsk and Tsarichansk the Areas of Dnepropetrovshchina.</seg>
		<seg id="28">By the way, while one rescue rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The other day all area was flown by a sad message - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolovsky area, in the opening day of hunting for pheasants, poachers for the sake of entertainment shot the swan family living on a local pond.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - locals fed them and did not offend.</seg>
		<seg id="31">When villagers, having heard shots, came running to a pond, four handsome swans already lay on water the dead.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Now the staff of Apostolovsky regional department of militia finds out who shot at the birds included in the Red List.</seg>

		<seg id="1">42-year-old Basharat Ditta transferred information to criminal authority to Neil Skarboro</seg>
		<seg id="2">The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction will be opened</seg>
		<seg id="3">It was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the Liverpool royal court.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about large police investigation because was afraid of exposure of the secret drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.</seg>
		<seg id="5">42-year-old Basharat Ditta gave to criminal authority to Neil Skarboro the classified information on investigation of its activities for a drug trafficking after it appeared under the threat because of the cocaine dependence.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The lawyer who got a nickname Bash and nicknamed among criminals &quot;the cool lawyer&quot; was arrested at home in 2011 after police operation on shadowing Scarborough of which it represented in the court connected with drugs earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Officers noticed how 32-year Scarborough left three bags with cocaine at the house of the lawyer in the city of Blackburn of the County of Lancashire while that was during a dinner of association of lawyers with colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The consequence opened that Ditta &quot;regularly used&quot; class A drug after tests showed cocaine traces in his hair, on its wallet and on credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Within eight months from January to August, 2011 he tried to receive illegally information on arrests of two people at the request of Scarborough, and also one of his accomplices.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All four suspects were under supervision of police within large-scale investigation of activity of the criminal organization for sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and the Western Yorkshire at this time.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They and 32 more persons were imprisoned later after the police withdrew during a series of raids heroin and cocaine for the sum of £1,5 million and also more than £200 thousand cash.</seg>
		<seg id="12">42-year-old Ditta told information to criminals because of fear that its cocaine dependence will be opened.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today in the Liverpool royal court of Ditt which works in law firm of Forbes Solicitors which is in Blackburn it was disgraced after recognition of his guilt in two cases of intended hindrance to implementation of justice following the results of three-week court in the Liverpool Court of a crown.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He admitted storage of cocaine on one of the previous court sessions.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Exposure of the lawyer happened after the police investigating activity of Scarborough found out that he regularly spoke from Ditt by phone since February, 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two detectives tracked the suspect and found how he approached Ditt's house in Blackburn and placed drugs of 60 percent purity in a black glove for golf under dustbins of the lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Soon after the Scarborough broadcast repeatedly called up from Ditt who Ivud Park of the Blackburn Rovers team was during a dinner at football stadium.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer came back home behind drugs; between them nine talk took place.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The court learned that Ditta &quot;regularly took&quot; cocaine after tests found class A drug traces in his hair, a purse and on its credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta was arrested later, however denied the cocaine use, told that talked to the suspected dealer as that was his client, and insisted that their communication is &quot;lawyer secret&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the detention of Ditt took the wallet and tried to take out some credit cards, however all of them were confiscated, the sample of hair was also taken from it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">On interrogation in police it told that along with a workplace, it had both a house office, and clients came to it home on legal affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="23">However the court knew that after important arrests it called the largest participants of a drug trafficking which row it represented in court earlier to tell that detectives know about them.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In an accusatory speech of Ann Whyte told: &quot;If someone also knows that it is not necessary to break the law, this is the lawyer on criminal cases&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of the position of the lawyer on criminal cases as he entered too close relations with certain clients.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Contact about which we speak — it not simply the drug dealer, and the drug dealer supplying with drugs of the own lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of his talk, certainly, will be lawful as he was their lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="28">However it substantially overstepped the limits of the usual relations of the lawyer and the client.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It interfered with police investigation so strongly as it is possible to allow these persons to continue the criminal activity.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr. Ditta did not honor the profession, and dishonored it.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He too approached with certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed to doubt the disinterest.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta did not admit guilt and declared: &quot;If I was the corrupted lawyer whom I am not, and would like to transfer information to Mr. of Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, I would make it immediately&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after a meeting the senior officer Li Holsted from police of Lancashire declared: &quot;Mr. Ditta turned from the lawyer on criminal cases into the criminal as soon as started getting drugs at representatives of organized crime&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Its addiction to cocaine made it hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the main participants of criminal groups who charged to it to get valuable information on police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Lawyers have to follow the royal standards of professional ethics and inspire in society trust and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to be covered with the profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Investigation in the matter of Mr. Ditt conducted division of Lancashire on especially dangerous organized crime which already achieved for it a sentence in three cases of storage of cocaine, and now also on hindrance to justice implementation, showing our aspiration to achieve fair punishment for criminals.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Let this business will serve as the prevention for criminals that nobody is out of reach of the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and we will bring to judicial responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough was condemned for 14 years after recognition of the fault in arrangement to the purpose of supply of heroin, cocaine and marihuana.</seg>
		<seg id="41">35 more people participating in fraud in the sum were sentenced to 153 years for the crimes connected with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On the site of Ditt organized conversation in the form of questions and answers in which he says that work of his dream — is the lawyer representing clients with the death sentence in America, the ideal partner for it at supper — Muhammad Ali, and motivation in work — this inequality.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Producers of jet planes are at enmity concerning seat width, when on a game big orders</seg>
		<seg id="1">Between the leading producers of planes fierce dispute concerning width of seats of a tourist class on distant flights inflamed, setting the tone for fierce confrontation at the Dubai aviation exhibition this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Dispute spins round width of the seats provided on long-haul flights to passengers of economy class, whose interests not always are in the center of attention of airlines, thus that the volume of the space allocated for them plays a key role in statements about efficiency of the last planes offered Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for introduction of the industry standard which would provide seat width not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in salons of economy class, but her main American competitor of Boeing says that airlines have to solve it.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Dispute goes when producers of planes compete on sales of more and more large versions of the two-engined long-haul planes, and on action potentially record orders are expected on November 17-21.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Configuration of back part of the plane — especially, whether 9 or 10 people in a row sit — takes the central place in statements for economic efficiency of new projects of &quot;mini-airbuses&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accomodate 406 people, proceeding from seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width placed on 10 in each row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport in economy class of 350 people on the seats 18 inches wide rowed on 9.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Giants of aircraft construction often exchange blows to technical questions by means of advertizing in the professional press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And now Airbus addresses directly to the public before an air show in Dubai where 777X, as expected, will become the leader with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It showed recently what can be the beginning of new advertizing war, having shown to financiers the slide representing three people at restaurant pressed to each other under the name &quot;You would agree on it?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats of narrower, than at regional turbo-propeller planes&quot; — the head of sales of Airbus John Likhi told.</seg>
		<seg id="12">With change of a food allowance people gain weight, but plane seats cardinally did not change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the beginning of the 1970th when widebody Boeing 747 set standards of modern distant travel, and a turn of century the weight of the average American man aged from 40 till 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to Department of health care of the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The grasp of a waist of the average American man of the 21st eyelid makes 39,7 inches, according to statistical data of a health service of the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus claims that her competitor adheres to the concept of seats of the 1950th years when the average grasp of a waist of those who was called by &quot;jet public&quot; recently, was already.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus says that ordered the research testifying that the additional inch in width of a seat improves quality of a dream for 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing challenges Airbus figures by the sizes of seats and says that producers should not interfere with decisions how to airlines to find balance between tariffs and conveniences.</seg>
		<seg id="18">According to her, researches show that convenience of salon depends not only on seat width.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;Everything actually is reduced to granting to airlines a choice and opportunity to do that in their opinion they have to make for achievement of success&quot; — the expert of Boeing in salons Kent Kreyver told.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want that we decided for them that will make for them profit.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know the business better, than someone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers the question consists in increase in space on each side, but for suppliers it even more often becomes a factor which can influence profit.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind this dispute there is a race behind orders for the planes estimated at least at $700 billion at the catalog prices in the next decades — there is enough to change a ratio of the American and European export.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As for the first time reported in July Reuters agency, an arrangement of seats — it that warms up rivalry in fight between the latest jet planes.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus, and Boeing declare 20 percent increase of profitability on one place in their latest two-engined long-haul models in comparison with the leader of the market in this segment, 365-seater Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The declared characteristics of Boeing are partially based on comparison of 10-seater ranks 777X with original 9-seater configuration of ranks of the constructive decision 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The prize in specific prime cost decreases when comparing with 10-seater configuration, now in use.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;The reason for which Boeing does it, consists in squeezing more places and to make the plane more competitive in comparison with our development&quot; — Kevin Keniston, the head of department of comfort of passengers of Airbus in Europe told.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, analysts say that salons with complete 10-seater series for existing the 777th specify that many passengers prefer dense seating which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Seats eighteen inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but reality such is that from the commercial point of view the Airbus offer is caused by threat from the 777th model&quot; — the specialist in an interior of salon Mary Kirby, the founder and the Runway Girl Network editor told.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing do not deliver a chair, but offer the catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Under Samora Mashel's statue looking at them from top to down, the president-founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the Maputo center to chant slogans about the world on one of demonstrations rare here.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want return of the world; we want stability&quot; — Vanessa told de Sousse, the executive director of investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Being afraid for the future of the country, it replaced a business suit with the t-shirt decorated with an inscription &quot;We demand safety&quot; in Portuguese, and joined on Thursday crowd at capital Square of Independence.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Within two weeks almost daily messages on collisions between government troops and Renamo arrived — these are one of the most cruel skirmishes since a truce more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo once was the known insurgent movement which was supported at first by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then the government of apartheid era of South Africa within efforts on destabilization of the independent government of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After a truce of 1992 it became opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts believe that the country hardly again will come down to the full-scale conflict, however recent events forced to be fidgety foreign investors and locals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Rates are high for fast-growing economy as opening of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal fields in the northwest can attract more than $50 billion as investments into the following some years from such companies as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling party of Frelimo, the leading political force since 1975, and Renamo's party accuse each other of the created intensity.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo's party claims that the government became the instigator of the last collisions, having attacked her members in Sofal's province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Attacks on the former insurgents then became aggravated when government troops attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dkhlakama — the leader of group, reported to the Financial Times newspaper of Fernando Mazanga, the representative Renamo.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government blames Renamo for initiation of collisions, accusing party of attack on soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The president Armando Guebuza tried to dispel fears concerning instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Guebuza declared AFP, to the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt the &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;everything that remained from his forces to try to prove that he can impose to the government own decisions&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Both Frelimo, and Renamo insist that wars want to avoid.</seg>
		<seg id="16">However fears grew after the message that Mazanga declared Renamo's refusal of the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He reported Financial Times that meant non-compliance with the agreement by party of Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our purpose - to return to negotiations, but with all gravity&quot; — told Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The previous negotiations between parties made for easing of intensity which was increased by a series of collisions this year a little.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;It is two influential persons (Guebuza and Dkhlakama) who faced foreheads&quot; — Joseph Hanlon, the lecturer of Open university and the expert in Mozambique told.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Any of them is not the good negotiator and any of them is not ready to make necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The party of Renamo which tries to achieve selective reforms, already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections appointed to November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators interpreted this pressure as attempt of the weakened movement to get concessions and financial bonuses from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The share of voices for Renamo decreases since 1992 whereas new party — the Democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM) which is based by the former member Renamo, as expected, improves the indicators on these elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza who has to resign next year when its second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want the world because he does not want to leave the president's post&quot; — told Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Not clearly, what opportunities Renamo possesses, however it already carried out destructive and prompt attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway conducting with the North on the South.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The majority of skirmishes took place in Sofal's province which is in several hundred kilometers to the North from Maputo, but includes Beira — port which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June of Rio suspended use of railway tracks approximately for a week after Renamo threatened with attack on the railroad.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mazanga it was evasive when asked it a question of, whether Renamo will repeat this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo's party wanted &quot;to warn the international community that affairs in Mozambique go not really well&quot;, – told Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Instability strengthened discontent with the government, and many people are also excited by corruption, slow rate of development and kidnappings which became frequent recently, speaks Fernando Lim, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that responsibility for the future of the country bear the government and the president who has to find the solution of these problems&quot; — he speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultuan, the demonstrator, told that people simply want stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Nobody is excited by neither Renamo, nor Frelimo, they simply want renewal of the world, they want a free access to roads&quot; — he told.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists shed light how the movements of a tail of a dog are connected with her mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier researches showed that happy dogs wag a tail to the right side (from the point of view of a dog) while alarmed dogs wag with a tail mainly to the left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other representatives of family of the psovy can notice these subtle differences in wagging by a tail and react to them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, the neurobiologist from Trentsky university, speaks: &quot;It is well known that at people the left and right parties of a brain differently participate in formation of pobuditel who cause positive or negative emotions&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we tried to look at it and at other types.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that the same as at the person, at dogs the right part of a brain controls the left side of a body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more how dogs react to versatile povilivaniye of tails of other dogs, researchers watched animals when they watched movies about other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the frequency of heartbeat of animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Possibly, we will understand already soon why their tails sometimes go to one party, and sometimes — in another</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara told: &quot;We showed to dogs of video with dogs — either naturalistic versions, or a silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of a tail and direct a tail more to the left or to the right&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">When animals saw that for the rest nothing the expressing dog moved a tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging a tail), they remained absolutely weakened.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they noticed that the tail inclined mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging a tail), their heartbeat became frequent and they looked alarmed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professor Vallortigara told that he does not think that dogs intentionally communicated with each other with the help of these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Actually he considers that dogs learned from the experience, about what movements they should worry, and about what — no.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He notices: &quot;If there are some meetings with other dogs and often wagging of their tail in one party are connected with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Researchers say that these results can yield to owners, veterinarians and trainers deeper understanding of emotions of the animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The expert in the field of behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, the invited research associate at veterinary school of University of Bristol, told that it was not the first research for check of, whether the left and right parties have value for dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year the group of scientists of university of the Lincoln found out that dogs turn the heads to the left if look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if look at a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in other scientific work of university of the Victoria in Canada it reported: &quot;Dogs approached a thicket a dog robot when wagging of her tail went to the left, but not to the right instead of becoming alarmed — opposite behavior in relation to the Italian research&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He told that distinctions could be because dogs in various researches not completely perceived animals in movies or dogs robots as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">There could be useful a research of how dogs react to the real dogs, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;While on various mammals there are enough certificates of that two hemispheres of a brain are used for various purposes, many details still it is necessary to specify, and dogs not an exception&quot; — he told.</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, considering that ease with which their behavior probably can be registered already soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go to one party, and sometimes — in another.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Whether the elite of Europe is ready to do business with England?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Campaign of Business for Britain was started in April with the obligation to bring together representatives of business and to define, what changes founders of welfare and workplaces of Great Britain want to see in the relations with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">For this purpose we ordered the biggest and fullest poll of the British business leaders, having asked them to introduce the ideas of Great Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The YouGov company interrogated more than 1000 business leaders representing a wide cut of business in Great Britain by the sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Conclusions of poll will appear surprise for many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found out that the vast majority of the enterprises looks for possibilities of export out of limits of Europe now, paying special attention to the countries which carry out modernization and grow while EU countries are in stagnation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want that the government gave a priority to new commercial relations with such countries as China, India and Brazil, but did not spend time for long and difficult process of reforming of the confused EU institutes.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When they were asked about their views of specific political affairs, from antimonopoly regulation to laws on production, most of business leaders considered that control of these key spheres of competence has to be returned to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was the general discontent with the uniform market, and representatives of business declared that costs from regulation from Brussels now outweigh advantages from stay in a trade zone of Europe — 40 percent of the large enterprises, traditionally most of a proyevropeyska adjusted from all companies agreed with it even.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The last and the most indicative — our poll of heads of business revealed that the obvious majority wants that Great Britain conducted a course of change of the contract and for the relations with the EU based on trade, but not on policy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This result which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business insists on &quot;significant change&quot; which will return powers back to Great Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Rates are high — achievement of changes in the contract and more favorable conditions for Great Britain will provide 16 percent shift in vote remaining in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The prime minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that the British business supports its plan of revision of conditions of membership of Great Britain in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that business expects that revision will lead to considerable shift in the current balance of forces back towards Great Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The best conditions for the British business are possible and become more and more necessary as the eurozone takes a way of closer economic and financial association.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority has to be given to workplaces and economic growth in Great Britain, and as show results of our poll, it means the strengthened concentration of attention on trade for business and fundamental changes in standard activity of Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">In Siberia you should not be a vegan: the hothouse tomato will not replace soup</seg>
		<seg id="1">Why the vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the correspondent of RIA Novosti found out.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The people who completely refused products of an animal origin should not live in Siberia.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Here to them not to transfer winter without loss for health, and no hothouse tomatoes compensate them, the Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interrogated on the eve of Day of the vegan consider.</seg>
		<seg id="4">To drink oil in liters</seg>
		<seg id="5">The strict vegetarianism when refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.</seg>
		<seg id="6">However dietitians are sure that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in food, at least, insalubriously for health.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Full refusal of animal products is harmful.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Animal protein contains irreplaceable amino acids which are very difficult for compensating the vegetable.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is necessary to include in a diet at least milk or eggs&quot;, - the nutritionist Marina Bogay is sure.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It cites as an example the fish containing irreplaceable Omega-3 fatty acid.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The richest with it vegetable oil - linen.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;To consume it in quantities, necessary for the person, it is necessary to drink in liters!&quot; - the nutritionist speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Physicians are sure that inhabitants of Siberia need to pay special attention to a diet in the winter.</seg>
		<seg id="14">During this season the vegetarianism is especially called into question.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In the conditions of our realities great demands are made of food.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Not to freeze, the increased caloric content is necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;If the person limits himself on animal products, respectively, this caloric content he does not gather additionally&quot;, - the expert speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The dietitian Olga Poznyak agrees with it.</seg>
		<seg id="19">She adds that imported vegetables and fruit - not an exit.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is better for person to feed mainly on products which are grown up in the region of residence or where he was born.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The genetic code is adjusted on the best assimilation and digestion of these products.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And in the winter people do not want not a cucumber pogryzt, and hot soup or still something posytny&quot;, - the doctor explains the position.</seg>
		<seg id="23">According to her, from this, that vegans can eat, various cereals, grain, bean, local vegetables, apples remaining at winter, the frozen berries are rather useful.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But it, unambiguously, it is not enough for good nutrition.</seg>
		<seg id="25">According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians in organisms have a level of vitamins sufficient only from the middle of August on the middle of September.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Full transition to vegetarianism in our rigid environment when temperature can change in days on 30 degrees and in May snow lies, is inexpedient.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The organism for life needs energy, and it, first of all, fat&quot;, - is stated by the physician.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Doctors note that the veganstvo is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Children grow, they need construction material, including in the form of amino acids.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And adhering to vegetarianism, we give them the defective.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Pregnant women also need the increased protein content, vitamins and microcells in the menu.</seg>
		<seg id="32">&quot;Veganki them is received less&quot;, - Bogay is sure.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Arifulina says that the adult is free to choose anything, &quot;to play those toys which wants&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="34">It has already created organism, a skeleton, bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="35">And children nevertheless have to eat fully.</seg>
		<seg id="36">If parents deprive of it any microcells or amino acids, choosing for it that he will eat, it is simple violation of the rights of the child.</seg>
		<seg id="37">&quot;Tomorrow you will not restore a lack of these or those substances for development of a brain, sight, bones any more&quot;, - she speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">All interrogated medical specialists agree in opinion on low quality of the grown-up in the winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruit.</seg>
		<seg id="39">That bring to us and grown up in greenhouses, contains smaller quantity of microcells necessary for us, than (grown up) in an open ground.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Quality of products not that&quot;, - speaks Bogay.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Arifulina also notes that imported and hothouse vegetables and fruit are far from ideal standards.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Sometimes the desire of producers to reap a bigger crop causes damage to quality.</seg>
		<seg id="43">&quot;Apples do not become brown on a cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and grow mouldy, tomatoes tasteless and not fragrant&quot;, - the physician gives examples, adding that they, most likely, are stuffed with excessive amount of fertilizers.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Also become suppliers not of vitamins, and cellulose.</seg>
		<seg id="45">The Head of Laboratory of the Siberian physics and technology institute of agrarian problems, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk does not agree with it.</seg>
		<seg id="46">She says that at the correct approach and observance of all norms and requirements in greenhouses cultivation of full-fledged vegetables is possible.</seg>
		<seg id="47">If try to expel more from square meter, of course, and will begin to water to a thicket, and to overfeed plants with mineral fertilizers.</seg>
		<seg id="48">For example, when there are too much nitric fertilizers, tomatoes quickly grow, they large, but watery and unsweetened&quot;, - she explains, adding that the quality question, first of all, depends conscience on the producer.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Russia out of fight for pollution of the cities cars</seg>
		<seg id="1">Attempts to solve transport problems of the large cities were observed in the majority of megalopolises of the world since the second half of the XX century.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As a rule, it was talked or of their reorganization and expansion of highways, or of attempts to reduce demand for automobile trips, number of cars and time of their use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The example of Singapore where rigid quoting of a gain of number of private cars is entered is widely known, and the right of their acquisition is bought at auctions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Its price can exceed the price of the car by two-three times.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The European cities, including London, entered a payment for entrance to the downtown.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, enter so-called green zones where entrance only is allowed cars with the certain ecoclass using also quality fuel (including biofuel or electric cars).</seg>
		<seg id="7">The agency of environment protection of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 &quot;the five-year plan of clean air&quot; in the total cost about 250 billion yuans (about $40 billion).</seg>
		<seg id="8">As told &quot;Kommersant&quot; the director of department of control of transport pollution of municipal bureau of environment protection of Beijing Li Kunsheng, a main goal of a five-years period - decrease in the leading pollutants of air by 20-35% by 2017, growth of number of private cars to the level which is not exceeding 6 million (now 5,2 million), and also increase no more than for 5% of use of fuel counting on one vehicle.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to agency, now motor transport in Beijing is responsible for 22,5% of the general air pollution.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Among the main measures of the program - restriction of use of the motor transport, and also introduction of surtaxes for car owners.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In addition, city measures of &quot;a green five-years period&quot; include the transition to fuel European standards accelerated in comparison with other country, introduction of local system of ecostandards and marking of cars and fuel, restriction on entrance of cars to the central part of the city, a ban on use of outdated vehicles (besides, creation of incentive financial programs of replacement of old cars on hybrid or electric cars), development of electrotransport (including public and office), development of public transport (including high-speed).</seg>
		<seg id="12">The ban for all private cars on the movement within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the People's Republic of China their six) one day in a week (the relevant information contains in registration plate of the vehicle), and also delivery of registration signs for cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of action of a lottery, the total of permissions to registration of private cars in Beijing made only a third of number of 2010) is also among automobile innovations of Beijing.</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to the existing &quot;Environmental Protection for 2012-2020&quot; state program, the number of the cities with high and very high air pollution has to be reduced to 128 (in their 2012 was 138).</seg>
		<seg id="14">According to Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources, in 2011 on &quot;mobile sources&quot; 41% of all emissions of the polluting substances in the atmosphere of the cities fell.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars exceed industrial, and in St. Petersburg - by nine times ten times.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the Russian Federation so far only start reflecting on opportunities of restrictive regulation of cars on streets of the cities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The director of Institute of transport economics and transport policy of VShE Mikhail Blinkin considers that the administrative and fiscal measures directed on suppression of demand for automobile trips - business obviously unpopular, they can be accepted by society only on condition of their total universality.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In case of Moscow there is a unique problem connected with structure of its vehicle fleet where there are two clusters poorly sensitive to any regulatory to influences - official and personal cars, and also cars of &quot;exclusive&quot; users which total number makes not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of vehicle fleet of Moscow).</seg>
		<seg id="19">The other day urbanists from the WHAT center in St. Petersburg prepared research where the balance of urban areas between a housing estate, the area of a paving and quantity of motor transport is analyzed.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Main conclusions of researchers: the downtown is provided with roads twice smaller demanded, and most of the motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time on parkings or it is simple on streets.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is as a result offered to build not parkings, but storage of cars, not to expand, and to reduce the carriageway (streets became more friendly for pedestrians), and also to limit use and placement of an individual transport in borders of the territory of a security zone of historic center (the general territory about 3212 hectares covering a number of the central regions of the city).</seg>

		<seg id="1">Doctor George Bvelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bvelle and his team carry out almost every weekend, accepting hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In this West African country of doctors there is not a lot of — only one on 5000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or via your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Doctor George Bvelle — one of 10 main heroes of CNN of 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for it or for any of other 10 main characters that he became the Hero of year of CNN.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This person will receive $250 000 for continuation of the outstanding work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">During 21 year George Bvelle saw how his father was restored to life and again fell into an unconsciousness, wandering on hospitals which were not equipped properly to help it.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Dzhamef Bvelle was traumatized in road accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At first at it the hand was only broken, but the arisen infection extended on a brain and caused a hematoma which reminded of itself until the end of life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;In Cameroon there were no neurosurgeons — George Bvelle told.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If we had money, we would take out it from Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead of this Bvelle accompanied for years the father in the crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment which they could receive.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is hard — Bvelle told.</seg>
		<seg id="15">— You can leave the house in the 5th mornings, come running in hospital to be the first, but you not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There is a lot of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some can die because they should wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation not strongly changed since the father Bvelle died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor on 5000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">For comparison, a ratio in the United States — one doctor on 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if Cameroonians could address to the doctor, it would be too expensive for much of them.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of expenses on health care in it are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Their only problem is poverty — Bvelle told.</seg>
		<seg id="24">— And because of poverty they cannot enjoy the life&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Seeing sufferings of the father and his very many compatriots, Bvelle was filled determination something with it to make.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Last year doctor George Bvelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a doctor and works as the vascular surgeon in the Central hospital Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It also founded ASCOVIME non-profit organization which will organize trips to rural areas on days off for providing free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008 it and its group of volunteers gave help of nearly 32 000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Nearly an every Friday it and to 30 people jam in vans, tie medical belongings to roofs and go on a cross-country terrain to visit the villages needing the help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Not always they are accompanied by good luck.</seg>
		<seg id="32">More than once they had to push cars through the rivers and dirt.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they come, them meet, as real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms what locals can only offer.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The free medical care in these villages really is a reason for a holiday, and Bvelle with his wide smile and boundless energy more than is happy to join fun.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning the crew starts accepting hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We accept 500 people on each trip&quot; — Bvelle told.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come with all the district in a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these clinics of the day off provides various medical services.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, sexually transmitted.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others can receive crutches, the offered points or free birth certificates — the documents necessary for school which many poor families simply are not able to afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evenings the crew performs simple operations under local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Operations are, as a rule, performed in the building of school, municipality or in the house; after procedure patients get up and go to a postoperative zone to release a place for the following person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Using the generator for publicizing of operational and sanitary processing of the equipment, Bvelle and his volunteers work till early morning of Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is excessive speed, but rural musicians usually help to maintain commitment of crew.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They all night long beat the drum that we were awake and continued to work&quot; — Bvelle told.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday members of crew go back to the city, tired, but proud of the work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">This group consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students performed 700 free operations for last year, and they know that their help can have huge value for those to whom they help.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One person explained that the free operation on treatment of hernia received by him will allow it to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;It will change the future for me and my family&quot; — the man told.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to these clinical receptions in days off and work in hospital as the surgeon Bvelle also works at the nights in private medical clinics round Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">This second work, according to him, provides 60% of financing of its non-profit organization; other means become covered at the expense of private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I do not even know when he sleeps&quot; — Cathie O'Malley, the medical student of the second year of Drekselsky university in Philadelphia, the volunteer in group Bvelle told.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He always or in hospital, or tries to earn money for the organization that it was possible to continue these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the USA and Europe to join Bvella in realization of his tasks, is opportunity of practice which they never had at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We had an opportunity to assist on operations where we helped to delete spots of blood or to hold tools for doctor Bvelle&quot; — O'Malley told.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Being the student second-year student, you would never receive such opportunity in America.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Students volunteers usually pay the journey to Cameroon, often arriving with the offered medicines.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But on arrival in Yaounde their food, transport and training pays by Bvelle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is a hero, undoubtedly&quot; — O'Malley told.</seg>
		<seg id="60">It gives the life of this organization, and his desire to help people of Cameroon infinitely.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bvelle almost constant load work is not a heartrending experience.</seg>
		<seg id="62">To help to lead happy life to another, to keep the promise made to the father — it that brings it big joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I do this work — Bvelle told.</seg>
		<seg id="64">— And I think of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope, he sees that I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I do it that people laughed to reduce their pain.</seg>

		<seg id="0">To &quot;the Russian mafia&quot; in the USA the new name - &quot;A brotherly circle&quot; was finally assigned</seg>
		<seg id="1">This week the black list of &quot;the Russian mafia&quot; in America was replenished with new names and four companies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The U.S. Treasury Department entered into &quot;A brotherly circle&quot; of three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and the Israeli.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The famous singer Grigory Leps whom the USA suspect of transportation of money for members of group appeared one of Russians.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In total in a black list of the USA 22 persons involved in &quot;A brotherly circle&quot;, and six organizations affiliated with it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nevertheless many experts drop a hint of doubt that such organization really exists.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The statement for 'A brotherly circle' resembles attempt to unite separate criminal groups&quot; more, - the expert in organized crime and professor of University of New York Mark Galeotti declared earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In his opinion, &quot;The brotherly circle&quot; reflects popular perception of &quot;the Russian mafia&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;I did not meet anybody in the Russian law enforcement agencies or still somewhere who would confirm existence of such criminal organization&quot;, - quotes Mr. Galeotti the American Center for research of corruption and organized crime.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor of George Mason University Lise Shelley also agrees with Mr. Galeotti.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;If they also act together, it is more similar to a criminal network, but not the organization&quot;, - the Center for research of corruption and organized crime provides her words.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti suggested that &quot;The brotherly circle&quot; unites in a bigger measure of confidants of the Russian thief in law Aslan Usoyan known as Grandpa Hassan.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="13">So, Lasha Shushanashvili's activity and Zachariah Kalashova, filled up the list in 2012, was closely connected with Grandpa Hassan, and one more participant of the list, Temuri Mirzoyev, had to Grandpa Hassan the nephew.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Nevertheless Mr. Galeotti notes that some persons and have no relation to Usoyan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In his opinion, all of them were united by rather common financial and criminal interests, for example supply of drugs from Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile scandal over inclusion in &quot;A brotherly circle&quot; of Grigory Leps - the favourite singer of the president of Russia Vladimir Putin - drew attention of the Kremlin.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Naturally, we count that we will receive more detailed information in this connection such decision why it in such lists was entered was made from our American partner colleagues, - the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov told.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Anyway he (Leps) is the citizen of the Russian Federation.</seg>
		<seg id="19">As well as interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Goldman Sachs warned about risks for the Russian economy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It first of all crisis of non-payments on the poor consumer credits and mass reductions of workers.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Our main concern now - not that growth was slowed down, and it is rather, structure of this growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Recently it is completely caused by consumption which almost does not reduce turns&quot;, - the chief economist of Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Graff declared, submitting the quarterly report of Investbank on the Russian economy yesterday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Now the nominal growth of salaries in Russia - about 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At inflation in 6% it will be able to provide future consumer demand approximately at the current level, expect in Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But profitability of the Russian companies falls therefore, most likely, they will be engaged in optimization of expenses on the personnel.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Today we see the essential growth of a share of salaries in GDP: if salaries grow for 10%, GDP - only for 2%, - Mr. Grafe explained.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The companies faced profitability reduction.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If she does not grow up, it can lead to dismissals and growth of unemployment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Russian business can raise wages, the chief economist of Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin comments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Unemployment near historical minima, the competition for workers the high.</seg>
		<seg id="13">To entice employees from the party or to hold present, employers should raise wages.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Consumption in Russia is supported also by very rapid growth of consumer crediting.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to Mr. Grafe, because of the highest rates on consumer loans of multiplicative effect this type of crediting does not render on national economy.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;We any did not see advantage for economy of consumer crediting growth, money does not disperse on economy, and comes back to the same banks in the form of percentage payments&quot;, - the economist told.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But a problem in other - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on the poor credits.</seg>
		<seg id="18">They are taken by generally rather poor people who have nothing to provide in providing.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Percent on such loans the high.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, do not return to their thicket&quot;, - Mr. Grafe noted.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Therefore the second threat to growth of economy in Russia - possible crisis of non-payments on the poor credits.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The director of the VShE Bank institute Vasily Solodkov already now sees signs of the becoming ripe bank crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The small credit organizations, without having access to cheap resources what the State Banks have, were compelled to raise funds of the population under high percent.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In reply the State Banks came to a track of war and began to reduce credit rates, - the economist continues.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The small credit organizations cannot give out loans under the same percent, differently they will have a negative percentage margin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If the State Banks do not refuse a dumping, Russia is threatened by full bank crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In recent weeks the economist considers deprivation of licenses of a number of banks as a harbinger of mass crash.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;The State Banks will not cope with such situation: the deposit insurance system initially was not calculated on system crisis&quot;, - the head of institute warns.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But growth of consumption will be slowed down and without crisis of non-payments, believe in Investbank, - because of refusal of indexation of salaries of civil servants and military, put in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Partially the fall to consumption will be broken by a freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, decrease of the inflation rate).</seg>
		<seg id="31">But only partially: if investments do not grow (and prerequisites to it are not present so far - see the reference), growth of consumption will all the same be slowed down, are sure of Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not see prerequisites for implementation of pessimistic scenarios yet.</seg>
		<seg id="33">&quot;The main risk is still falling of price of oil&quot;, - he speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="34">By its assessment, the economy of Russia will start being reduced at the cost of oil lower than 90 dollars/barrel.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank yet not in forces to lower interest rates in economy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The paradoxical picture is observed: inflation decreased, and banks began to increase rates.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It can mean that they did not believe the Central Bank which declared transition to inflation targeting&quot;, - Clemens Graff told.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The percentage policy of the Central Bank does not influence market rates, influences only rates of interbank crediting.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;For the Central Bank it is crash of all hopes&quot;, - Clemens Graff estimated.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The money received at auctions of the Central Bank uses banks not for crediting of economy, and for management of the liquidity</seg>
		<seg id="41">As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes at once, it means that means try to leave on speculation against ruble.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;Sooner or later the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work&quot;, - Mr. Grafe told and reminded that the state plans to start up ruble in &quot;free swimming&quot; by the end of 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But it is necessary or to make it earlier, or to increase a key rate of the Central Bank (5,5%), he considers.</seg>
		<seg id="44">By its assessment, ruble exchange rate is now artificially overestimated by 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="45">I cut only one road - to weaken, - the expert draws a conclusion.</seg>
		<seg id="46">But if the Central Bank arouses in financiers though a doubt shadow that elimination of a currency corridor is not part of policy onto weakening of ruble, it can bring down ruble much more strongly.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAU: &quot;Air passengers can use gadgets now by planes (but not to call from the mobile phone)&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Air passengers will be able to use the electronic devices during all flight to read, work, play games, to watch movies and to listen to music, but not to speak by mobile phones — according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that changes will happen immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">As quickly such change is realized, will vary depending on airline, the FAU administrator Michael Uerta at a press conference told.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Airlines should show FAU as their planes answer the new guidelines and that they update the manuals for members of flight crew and the rule on laying of devices to correspond to the new guidelines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">FAU declared that it already received plans from some airlines for expansion of use of portable electronic devices in planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among airlines which already submitted plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on a condition of the plan we could approve expansion of use of electronic devices soon&quot; — declared FAU.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now passengers are obliged to switch-off the smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the plane is closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They should not restart them until the plane reaches height of 10 000 foots and the captain will not give a green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers have to switch off the devices again when the plane decreases for landing, and not to include them until the plane appears on the earth.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes are properly protected from electronic hindrances, can allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxing, declared FAU.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The majority of the new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at big heights, as expected, answer these criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glejding, the president of Association of professional stewards, welcomed these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;After the new policy will be safely realized (and we are going to work in close contact with a carrier to achieve it), it will be a sure bet&quot; — declared Gleyding.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We frankly were tired to feel like &quot;persons on duty on school&quot; when business reaches this question.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But connection to the Internet for surfing, an exchange of e-mails, text messages or loading of data will be all the same forbidden at the height less than 10 000 foots, reported agency.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It will be offered to passengers to switch the smartphones, tablets and other devices in the plane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thus, still any &quot;Words with friends&quot; — intellectual Internet game which the actor Alec Baldwin played on the smartphone in 2011 when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from the plane of American Airlines airline for refusal to switch off the device when the plane was at a gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices, such as laptops, it will be still necessary to stack in a luggage compartment as they can injure somebody if fly on all salon.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Calls from the mobile phone in flight will also be still forbidden.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Regulatory powers on phone calls belong to the Federal commission on communication, but not FAU.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAU can withdraw a ban on some electronic devices during take off and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month Mark Rozenker from National council on safety of transport, the national expert in safety of transportations of CBS News, declared that cell phones are still considered as risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Cell phones — it validly a problem not only because potentially they can create hindrances for navigation devices, but we know thanks to FKS that they can create hindrances for towers of cellular communication when the plane is airborne&quot; — Rozenker told.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The branch advisory committee created by FAU for studying of this question recommended last month that the government allowed wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years pressure upon FAU for the purpose of weakening of restrictions on their use increased.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics, such as democrat senator from the State of Missouri Claire Makkaskil, claim that for a ban there are no the good reasons connected with safety.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Observance of restrictions also becomes more and more difficult to be provided as use of devices became universal.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some researches show that to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to switch off the devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">FAU started limiting use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966 in response to messages on hindrances for the navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying with themselves FM radio receivers — hi-tech gadgets of that time.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New airliners are much more dependent on electric systems, than the previous generations of planes, but they are also developed and approved by FAU, as steady against electronic hindrances.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines offer passengers use of Wi-fi at cruiser height within several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The planes modified for Wi - Fi - systems, are also steadier against hindrances.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of liners is adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, told Uerta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices usually radiate radio signals of much lower power, than the previous generations of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Devices for reading electronic books, for example, radiate only the minimum signals when browsing pages.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among those who achieved mitigation of restrictions on use by passengers of electronic devices, there was an Amazon.com company.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011 representatives of the company loaded the whole airliner the devices for reading electronic books Kindle and flew on it to check existence of problems, but did not find them.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the FAU advisory committee expressed the mixed feelings concerning, whether any risk represents use of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from National association of air passengers declared that considers hindrances from devices real even if the risk is minimum.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other members of the committee said that there are only separate messages of pilots confirming that devices can create hindrances for aviation systems, and the majority of these messages the very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Nevertheless the committee recommended that FAU allowed pilots to demand from passengers to switch-off devices during instrument landings in the conditions of limited visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The group of representatives of the tourist industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sane step towards to passengers who now use a set of technological devices.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are glad that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and protection&quot; — Roger Dow, the CEO of Tourist association of the USA told.</seg>

		<seg id="7">As the intelligence service claims, Smirnov under cover scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly came to Lithuania and contacted to local politicians, political scientists and members of the media.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine which could deprive process of smoking of cigarettes of pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One dose of a vaccine could protect mice from nicotinic dependence for the rest of life.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests prior to tests in public are necessary, on what some years, but professor Ronald Kristall from medical college will be required Whale Cornell in New York declared that the first results encourage.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We very much hope that such strategy of application of a vaccine can help, at last, to millions of smokers who tried to throw, having tried all methods which are available in the market today, but found out that their nicotinic dependence rather strong to overcome it by means of these modern means&quot; — professor Cornell told.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus which was developed to bear genetic information for production of anti-nicotinic antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus selectively infects cells of a liver which then start making a stable stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Antibodies track down any molecules of nicotine in blood, neutralizing them before they reach a brain, preventing receiving nicotinic blow by the smoker.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In tests the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine subsequently, continued the normal activity.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And mice who were not given a vaccine, &quot;relaxed&quot;, and it is a sign of that nicotine reached their brain, - researchers speak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">These experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The previous tobacco vaccines suffered failure because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">To keep the high level of antibodies, injections needed to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of a new vaccine probably will be much lower because it turns cells of a liver into factories of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professor Kristall told that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotinic dependence.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more probable that she will be used by smokers to give up smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They will know that if they will start smoking again, they will not receive from this pleasure because of a nicotinic vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit&quot; — he told.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The British scientists told that results were interesting, but warned that additional researches are necessary.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Frontier Airlines will raise a payment for hand luggage</seg>
		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to raise from passengers to $100 that they carry by hand luggage aboard the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to start raising to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or aerated water though their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to leave themselves all can.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new payment for hand luggage extends on bags in the top luggage compartments therefore the small bags placed under a seat will remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier told that will raise $25 if collecting is paid in advance, and $100 if the traveling pay, having only appeared at a gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The representative of Frontier Kate O'Malley told that the payment in $100 has to force passengers to think of payment in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We do not want to raise a payment for it&quot; — she told.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines started raising a payment for the first and second bag which is handed over in baggage, in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The passengers trying to avoid this collecting fill so much, how many will be able, in the hand luggage placed in the top luggage compartments because of what in these compartments often there is no place.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Collecting — one of ways to force passengers to carry by less aboard.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'Malley told that this new collecting actually not for the sake of earning money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The matter is that the most loyal clients of Frontier declare that it becomes more difficult to find a place in the top luggage compartments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy tickets on the site of airline, will not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It means that one passenger in turn at an exit to the flight Frontier can have an opportunity to carry by a bag free of charge while the following passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'Malley told that change of procedures on the website and at front desks of Frontier is urged to guarantee that passengers will know about collecting before they get to a gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">New charge Frontier for hand luggage will not start being raised till summer though date is not determined yet.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often complain of a payment for baggage and other collecting, but airlines adore them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They claim that processing of baggage costs money, and passengers who need this service, have to pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on the Wall Street consider addition of luggage collecting is familiar that airlines raise enough money to cover costs of air flights after several years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However the majority of them did not concern charges for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. entered the first charge for hand luggage three years ago, and one more discounter of Allegiant Air followed its example later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such collecting is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the consultant for airlines Jay Sorensen who attentively traces additional collecting told.</seg>
		<seg id="22">By its assessment in the report of December, 2011, charge for hand luggage brings Spirit of $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, the former top manager of Midwest Airlines, flied the flight Spirit recently, and it was interesting to it that he will find in a gate when passengers face unusual charge Spirit for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Process of landing was the most smooth that I saw for the career in airlines&quot; — he told.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see a gnashing of teeth and emergence of a fight at a gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he told, &quot;and landing took place promptly&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also follows Spirit concerning a payment in $2 for coffee, tea, aerated water or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier declared that passengers who receive aerated water or juice, can leave themselves all can and that having added coffee it will be provided free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="29">She will still distribute free of charge water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways short time tried to raise a payment for drinks in 2008, but refused it in seven months after passengers started complaining and no other large airline followed its example.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Frontier initiative of collection of a payment for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from airline — is its last measure for customer acquisition on the website.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay online sellers of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It allowed all airlines incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, but not to address to tourist online agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">However Frontier went further all in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September it started giving twice less bonus miles of often flying passenger to clients who bought tickets through on-line travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday it cut off bonus number of miles to 25 percent from trip miles.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So, the trip to 1000 miles with Frontier acquired at on-line travel agency would allow to receive 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Besides, passengers can choose a place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the site Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier have a base of loyal clients in its hometown of Denver, but its business is reduced and becomes unprofitable.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The revenue decreased by 9 percent, and flight opportunities were reduced almost by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the parental company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic tries to correct Frontier finance within sale to airline.</seg>

		<seg id="1">And now - news because of the ocean, namely - from Syria where, as we know today, Israel struck blow to rockets of the Russian production which, according to messages, intended to &quot;Hezbollah&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Today Syria satisfied an important condition - to destroy the productions of the chemical weapon by November 1.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It was made within the agreement reached with mediation of Russia and which allowed the USA not to perform military operation which they closely approached this summer.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In more detail our chief international correspondent Richard Engel will tell about the weapon and that all this means to the Syrian president.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Washington declared that Assad's regime will be punished for it.</seg>
		<seg id="6">More than 1400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were lost in August from the poisoning gas.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And punishment came.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But not in the form of the American bombings, and in the form of the transaction which Assad's friend - Vladimir Putin arranged.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Syria will refuse the chemical weapon to the middle of the next year.</seg>

		<seg id="16">The question not in, whether happens it, and in when it happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is not legitimate any more and has to leave.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But Assad remains.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Also feels even more surely.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Its troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.</seg>
		<seg id="21">His opponents are separated and badly armed.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Its people forcedly leave the houses, many starve.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Some should feed on leaves and cats.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Many believe that Bashar al-Assad avoided punishment for massacre.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The agreement on the chemical weapon is called success of diplomacy, to inspectors awarded Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad made impression of the person ready to cooperation.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Today in Washington the ambassador of the USA in Syria had to answer difficult questions.</seg>
		<seg id="27">When the child perishes for hunger, it is hardly easier for his mother than that did not kill him by means of the chemical weapon.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Parents of interseksualny children can choose &quot;uncertain sex&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European country which recognized the third floor at the children born with external genitals of intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The newborn will surely not attribute man's or a female any more.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new law does not demand from parents to call any sex of such children, allowing parents to specify a floor as &quot;uncertain&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; in their birth certificates.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions on operation on assignment of a floor by the newborn, and counteract discrimination of interseksualny people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One interseksualny person, according to BBC, told many years later: &quot;I am not a man and not the woman&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain the scrappy product created by doctors with bruises and scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">About one of two thousand children born annually is not neither the boy, nor the girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They have an interseksualnost, one of about 60 pathological states which get under the diagnosis of &quot;violation of sexual development&quot; — the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or seed plants) or unusually developed external genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson, perhaps, was interseksualy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Gender identification is still insufficiently studied, however most of experts in the USA say that if the sex cannot be defined, better to use all available information and to appropriate it, than to wait and trace psychological and physical development of the child before carrying out operation if at all it will occur.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist, doctor Jack Dresher who specializes on problems of gender identification, told that the new German law &quot;sounds as good idea&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Interseksualny children create an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have menacing violation lives which demand surgery, however most of children does not have them&quot; — he told.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can appropriate a floor without operation and then look as the personality develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science how at the child any gender identity will develop, is not too exact.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nobody can answer questions of why it occurs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It as a riddle about why people happen gomoseksualna.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The report sent to the European commission in 2011 describes interseksualny people as differing from transsexual or transgender as their state is related not to a gender, and to their biological structure which does not correspond only neither man's, nor to a female, and is typical for both at the same time or is not characteristic for one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics can be shown in secondary sexual signs, such as the muscle bulk, distribution of indumentum, a breast and a constitution; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also adumbrates about discrimination which interseksualny and transgender people in the sphere of employment, and also about the level of oppressions, cruelty and crimes because of prejudices face.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Boys with gender deviations have a special camp now.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put man's, female or &quot;the third floor&quot; in the official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June the 52-year-old inhabitant of Australia Norri Mai-Uelbi became the first-ever person, recognized &quot;sexless&quot;, having asserted in court the right for saving of the &quot;uncertain&quot; sexual status for the rest of life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the German passports the third designation in addition to M and F — X, that is interseksualny will be used.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In the next France gender issues still cause contradictions, according to news release on the France 24 channel.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011 tens legislators from France, this pronounced Catholic country, signed the petition about withdrawal of &quot;the gender theory&quot; from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with the German law, having written that &quot;in a situation when the world is involved in a new state where the floor is a choice subject, and sexual activity — no, we overturn two more pillars of a civilization&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="28">One mother of the newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that established to children a floor at the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;To raise the child rather hard and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know a sex of the child&quot; — she told the website for parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically the children born with male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites — by name beautiful Greek god who possessed signs of both floors.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And more than only ten years ago the medical community perceived a gender as a leaf on which it is possible to erase everything, and then again to draw.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now many challenge the ethical bases for a surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult, and doctors sometimes make an incorrect choice, without knowing as the child will perceive the floor appropriated to it when grows.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the middle of the XX century it was called as &quot;an urgent psychiatric case&quot;&quot; — Dresher told.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When such children were born, you called not the psychiatrist — you called the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The dominating theory how to treat children with genitals of intermediate type, was offered by doctor John Manya from Johns Hopkins University who considered that the gender easily gives in to change.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He introduced the term &quot;gender identity&quot; into circulation and claimed that environment signals, including social — how parents raise the child — interact with genes and the child's hormones, defining, whether the person will consider himself as the man or the woman.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one case of 1966 known as &quot;John/Joan&quot;, its theories appeared questionable.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the boy's parents, whose penis was injured during negligent trimming, completely to castrate the child, having removed also his small eggs, and to raise it as the girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Manya presented a case as a successful example of transition, but it was not so&quot; — Dresher told.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married the woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But in 38 years he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Dresher told that now some doctors still &quot;apply this model&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990th, with arrival of the Internet, the people who endured these operations on change of a floor declared themselves, &quot;dissatisfied with result&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such is was also Jim Bruce's case, the 36-year-old writer from the State of Montana which was born with man's chromosomes of XY, but genitals of intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors could not define precisely, whether there was for it a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he will never be able to lead &quot;full-fledged life&quot; of the man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Therefore soon after its birth in 1976 the external genital and Bruce's small eggs were surgically removed, and it was brought up as the girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Began to give it female hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I am not a girl&quot; — he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In 18 years to it the vaginoplastika was appointed.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But being in a depression and understanding that something not so, he demanded medical documentation.</seg>
		<seg id="53">That he learned, was awful.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at the birth, and anybody never told me about it.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with violation of sexual development which did not give it to a body to make enough testosterone for normal development of genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Having learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving pricks of testosterone and having removed the breast.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Operation made it fruitless.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today he speaks out in defense of others in the organization under the name Interface Project, trying to bring into norm perception of people with an interseksualnost.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Ann Temar-Mettis, the executive director of the Californian legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned by that the German law &quot;induces to a naveshivaniye of labels and a stigma&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned by that the German law will induce parents to make the hasty decision and to give to the child &quot;uncertain sex&quot;&quot; — she told.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that it will promote intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We consider that it is better to appropriate man's or a female, and then to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we did not see yet how this law, therefore everything will prove that we can do — it to speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Temar-Mettis told that her organization supports the Australian law as &quot;it allows adults to make a choice for the third floor&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults have to have opportunity to make own decisions on a formal sex&quot; — she speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law means its assignment at the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This battle which small children should not enter at this stage.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions of rather own body.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arleene Barats, the mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people with support group, told that the German law &quot;will support&quot; both parents, and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">The daughter Barats, Cathie, was born with man's chromosomes, however it has a violation of sexual development under the name &quot;syndrome of full tolerance to androgens&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="71">As its androgenic receptors incorrectly work, at Cathie female signs developed.</seg>
		<seg id="72">It has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now, in 29 years, Cathie is married and studies internship in children's psychiatry at university of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">In spite of the fact that she is infertile, she hopes to become the parent by means of adoption or gestational substitute motherhood.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives to parents time not to make hasty decisions&quot; — Barats told.</seg>
		<seg id="76">He allows them time to make some analyses and to understand a situation, and also a period before they write &quot;man's&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In that case you as it should be — raise the child, love the child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a wonderful child, and you feel pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We do not need to do operation which is irreversible hasty.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates excitement which moves parents because they do not feel that arrive correctly&quot; — she told.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Eventually the child will solve, with what floor to him or her is more comfortable — and it is remarkable.</seg>
		<seg id="82">It gives to children the chance to make the decision independently.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The federal government insists that the package of saving measures of $325 million for the weakened health system of Tasmania will be added with severe conditions which guarantee that the government of staff will not spend means for nothing.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek declared that the Commonwealth takes &quot;urgent measures&quot; to prevent the crisis caused by aging of the population of this island state, higher level of chronic diseases and restrictions of system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The decision on financing within four years was made after consultations of the government with the independent deputy of Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government offered a package of the emergency saving measures which, we trust, will solve specific problems, facing staff&quot; — Mrs. Plibersek declared today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The package of $325 million in size includes $31 million for blitz campaign for planned operations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">2600 more operations, including orthopedic and operations on removal of a cataract, will help to overcome lag.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There is also money for the clinics accepting patients without making an appointment in Hobart and Launceston, for improvement of quality of leaving after a hospital, training of medical experts, security services of mental health and introduction of systems of personal electronic medical records in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments will go on the ideas stated by the advanced doctors realization how it is better to help health system of Tasmania&quot; — Mrs. Plibersek told.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will work in the mode of the strict reporting and responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Staff will need to support the current levels of financing to receive funds of the Commonwealth, and monthly to report on where it spends these additional resources.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The commission from three people will be created to be convinced that staff provides services as it is possible more effectively and is more effective.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr. Wilkie declared today that $325 million will solve nothing, &quot;if they are not followed by original reform which will put health system of Tasmania on steadier basis&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless he praised the government for the answer to its request for the urgent help with which he for the first time addressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I hope that the package of the federal help will promote considerably to a conclusion of health system of this staff from critical condition&quot; — Mr. Wilkie told.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the government of staff, these additional selective procedures substantially compensate recent reductions.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the federal oppositional representative on health care Peter Datton considers that today's statement represents &quot;the decision similar to an adhesive plaster&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason for which we here, consists that the labor government of staff pulled out $430 million from health system&quot; — he told ABC TV TV companies.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When the government of staff tears off nearly half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth puts 300 million, it is impossible to pretend to be that it is good news.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Shout of despair of the voter Obama</seg>
		<seg id="1">I voted for the president Obama twice, sharing hope for possibility of changes</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says that Obama allowed obstructionism of republicans to nullify laudable efforts.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The obstructionism cannot excuse problems with the website of the health system reformed by Obama, attacks of UAVs</seg>
		<seg id="4">Memoirs about Obama's campaign are of 2008 a sad reminder that could be</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathanael P. Morris — the second-year student of medical faculty of Harvard university.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I read awfully sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I thought that this book will inspire me at the time of despondency on the second year of medical faculty and will revive in me feeling of hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;Impudence for a victory&quot;, and these are memoirs about presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I stop writing reports on my patients in the evening and I go to bed, this book returns me when the policy inspired millions of people, and performances could capture spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The victory on elections was impressive, and hosts of news programs did a pause for judgment of this historical moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My schoolmates cried with happiness, and my parents protected all newspapers which they could only find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The young team of strategists had to come to the White house, and the people were ready to changes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In an effective date of Obama in a position in 2008 its level of support made 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Return to the present represents rough awakening as wrest from dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem far reminiscence, a sad reminder on the missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years which passed since I lowered the first ballot, changes really happened.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was that I could not even imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I pay to Obama tribute for its big and various achievements, from adoption of law on available medical care to a conclusion of our military from Iraq, cancellation of the rule &quot;Do Not Ask, Do Not Speak&quot;, Osama bin Laden's murder.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, I consider that the party obstructionism blocked too many attempts of advance of our country forward: immigration reform, possibility of a choice of the state health care and closing of base in Guantanamo among the other.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after uncountable number of times when I appeared on the party of administration of Obama, protecting it before colleagues and contemporaries, I finished explanations which I can provide.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I reached a point of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The obstructionism of republicans cannot explain permission to the wiretap of foreign leaders or drawing blows with UAVs on innocent children in other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He cannot explain data collection about private life of Americans by National security agency or prosecutions of the unmaskers opening illegal actions of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He cannot explain murder of the American citizen Anwar al-Avlaki extrajudicially or non-compliance with limits of public financing and expenses during presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It cannot justify conclusions of the report in which it is said that the efforts used by the White house to make silent mass media, are &quot;the most aggressive … since Nixon's administration&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="27">And recently it cannot justify that it is not possible to develop the simple website within more than three years after signing of the law on available medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know, whether it to me should be expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Whether I had to understand at the age of 18 years, what the management can contradict political campaigns which precede it?</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is obvious that work on an elective office is not the predictable action program as our public dialogue will be formed by opposition political party and such casual events as slaughter in Nyyutaun.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Nevertheless by all examples which are listed above by me it is visible that they substantially were own choice of administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And it that disturbs me most of all.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm concerning its candidate.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney represented unclear and rough alternative, appear, that he is not able to make the decision on own policy or views.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I believed that in the second time Obama, having exempted from pressure of future elections, will equal hopes about which we heard during such long time.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, when this week Obama's rating fell lower than 45%, it became much more difficult to come back in 2008 by means of this book.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It forces me to grieve for many promises which disappeared.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read that part of the book in which it is described how Clinton inflicted over Obama deafening defeat on primary elections in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At a meeting according to the analysis of the reasons of failure it told the employees that they have to return back to normal and remain faithful to the purpose.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want that we returned our appeal — he told.</seg>
		<seg id="41">— We have to remember the one who we are&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Passed five years, Mr. president, and I absolutely agree with you.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The opinions expressed in this comment belong only to Nathanael Morris.</seg>

		<seg id="4">He took the oath before 18 judges in black cloaks in the courthouse on the bank of Nile built in style of the ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We aspire to the better future, new Egypt and the second republic&quot; — Morsi during the ceremony which is sent live on the state television told.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation of new life — absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability&quot; — Morsi, the 60-year-old engineer with an American education from &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, fundamentalist group which the most part from 84 years of the existence was the forbidden organization serving as a target for rigid actions of the governments replacing each other declared.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Morsi arrived with a small train soon after the 11th morning local time.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundreds of supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike a presidential pomp of times of Mubarak, the movement was stopped only for a short time to pass its motorcade on usually brisk road connecting the downtown to the southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Though Morsi derided as not charismatic &quot;a spare wheel&quot; of &quot;Brothers&quot;, its personal prestige sharply grew from the moment of its victory and Friday performance in which he tried to present itself(himself) as the candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who wants to finish business of revolt of 2011 against authoritative Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Today Egypt is the civil, national, constitutional and modern state&quot; — Morsi dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in the hall sheathed by wooden panels where he took the oath told.</seg>
		<seg id="11">After Morsi went to Cairo university where he had to deliver the inaugural speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The formal reception with the army orchestra which executed a national anthem during which he stood at attention &quot;quietly&quot; was accorded to it.</seg>
		<seg id="13">There was a military figure field marshal Hussein Tantawi.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Its arrival was met by the slogan &quot;Army and the People — One Hand&quot; which was chanted by hundreds of audience in the main lecture hall of university.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo university in the 1970th years became a stronghold of Islamic student's groups.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi took the symbolical oath on Friday on Tahrir Square where the revolt which finished authoritative board of Mubarak last year arose and promised to return powers of the president of which his position was deprived by the Council of War which accepted affairs from the overthrown leader.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But having agreed to take the official oath before court, but not before parliament as it is accepted, it carries out will of military, and it is a sign of that race for power will proceed.</seg>

		<seg id="4">James Klepper, the director of the National intelligence of the USA, in September again assured that the USA do not use possibility of foreign intelligence &quot;for plunder of trade secrets of the foreign companies in interests of the American companies to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their profit&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden — the contract employee who became the unmasker — started publishing the treasury of secrets of intelligence of the USA, the European governments and heads of the companies are not assured any more, whether it is possible to take the director the word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Messages on that the National agency of safety of the USA watched the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and got access to the data stored at suppliers of cloudy services of the USA including Google and Yahoo, lifted the paranoia of corporations caused by shadowing of the state on new heights.</seg>
		<seg id="7">News that phone of the chancellor Angela Merkel was listened, perhaps, about ten years became a last straw.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the most influential person of Europe can become a target, of course, potential targets are also leaders of business.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between intelligence services of the USA and the companies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I think, it is quite probable that these data are used with mutual benefit.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Germany has to wake up&quot; — Oliver Gryun, the president of the association BITMi which represents the small and average IT companies of Germany speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The German companies are convinced that the USA now represent almost same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and plunder of data, according to the research published in July by consulting agency EY.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In all documents opened by Mr. Snowden, nevertheless, still there were no certificates of that the USA transferred trade secrets of the foreign companies to the own companies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Politicians expressed concern about that the EU is not enough certain opportunities in the field of information technologies and the Internet, and expressed opinion that he should try to reduce the dependence on the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Businessmen are skeptical about it.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Someone in parliament of Germany says that we have to create the German Google.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I can only close eyes and slowly open them again …</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;It not option&quot; — Gasso Plattner, the president of the German company supplier of the software for business of SAP speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If there is a need for the powerful European IT industry, you should not allow it have to been lost more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Everything, except the IT industry.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And nevertheless the coverage and technical development of agencies on espionage of the USA which became known thanks to Snowden's revelations were shock for some companies which thought earlier that the biggest risk of shadowing represents China.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Big shift happens in cloudy technologies where heads of the European companies realized better that the data which are stored in the USA are in the same jurisdiction and therefore are potentially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to the research conducted by trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non American participants refused plans to use services of the cloudy provider who is in the USA after exposure of the American program for the intellectual analysis of data of Prism.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Jim Sneyb, one of executive directors of SAP, told: &quot;We see that consumers ask a new question which did not arise a year ago, namely: where my data are stored and whether you can guarantee that they physically will remain in this jurisdiction&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many German heads claim that the last messages — it only confirmation of that they already knew: the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and, therefore, these data have to be protected at any cost.</seg>
		<seg id="27">That there is an economic espionage — no wonder.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It always took place.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;It was a subject of discussion many years and significantly did not change in the current polemic&quot; — Curt Bock, the chief executive officer of the BASF chemical company speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Americans spy for us at commercial and industrial level, and we too spy for them because it enters our national interests — to protect our commercial enterprises.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Leaders of corporations usually do not like to brag of those countermeasures which they undertook as it can provide advantage to the opponent.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In the large companies the thought that to take a free flash card at an exhibition or to leave the laptop without supervision in a hotel room — it, at least, imprudently was acquired for a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Ulrich Hakenberg, the board member of Audi carmaker, says that many years it is standard practice — to assemble mobile phones before board meetings that they could not be used as taps.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The federal service of protection of the constitution of Germany recommends to heads of the companies to consider possibility of use of simple pre-paid mobile phones during foreign trips because of vulnerability of smartphones.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Pre-paid mobile phones jump out subsequently.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Nevertheless there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable for breakings and shadowing.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Germany many similar companies are leaders in the world market in the concrete niche.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;Small and medium-sized companies often do not have experience, employees and financial resources effectively to protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access&quot; — warns in the report of BfV.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The USA warn the own companies about economic espionage from other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The national prospecting report of the USA in February placed France together with Russia and Israel in the second row of violators who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, approves The Washington Post.</seg>
		<seg id="41">The board member of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it is about economic espionage, &quot;French are most worse&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Bernard Skarsini, the former head of the French agency of internal investigation of DCRI as it is reported, said in interview this month: &quot;Services are known perfectly that all countries, even when they cooperate in fight against terrorism, spy for the allies&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="0">After charge of Evgeny Vasilyev's bad taste started talking</seg>
		<seg id="1">Evgenia Vasilyeva on which person nearly a year the close attention of mass media is riveted, still never commented on numerous publications in the press both about plunders in the Ministry of Defence, and about it personally - the relations with the ex-Minister of Defence Anatoly Serdyukov, its poetry and about addiction to valuable things.</seg>
		<seg id="2">However on November 1 the person involved in business of &quot;Oboronservis&quot; broke silence.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Said in interview of Life News of Vasilyev: &quot;Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to pull out from me any negative information concerning the former Minister of Defence&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">There was a blackmail regarding that I have to give evidences, differently I will be put in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Today these threats stopped.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Further we go to court, we will prove the innocence.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We are sure of a victory for 100 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Thus from interview it is possible to draw a conclusion that, perhaps, most of all Vasilyeva was touched by words that at her is unimportant with taste.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Possibly, the statement of the official representative of the RF IC Vladimir Markin that in a collection of pictures which was collected by the person involved in business of &quot;Oboronservis&quot;, fakes were found means.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Among the arrested property there is a number of pictures which the hostess, being confident in the deep knowledge of art, got as masterpieces of world painting.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However the art criticism examination appointed by investigators after arrest of these pictures established that they have no art value and, simply speaking, are cheap fakes&quot;, - Markin at the beginning of October noted.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defence...</seg>
		<seg id="13">Then after all recognized that they from the Ministry of Defence are not stolen, thus told that at me it is bad with taste.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?</seg>
		<seg id="15">In my opinion, it simply a lawlessness&quot;, - is told by Vasilyeva.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Thus on a question, whether she admits the guilt though in one of 12 criminal episodes imputed to it, Vasilyev declared: &quot;Naturally, no.</seg>
		<seg id="17">There is nothing to recognize in general.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Moreover, there is no damage of the Russian Federation about which there is a speech.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Simply mislead the people, that's all.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Besides, in response to today's statement of the RF IC that Vasilyeva evades from studying of materials of criminal case, the lawyer of the person involved declared that to it and his client &quot;the investigator does not allow to get acquainted with case papers&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="21">What served as the reason to revelations by Vasilyeva who is under house arrest who was still not communicating with the press?</seg>
		<seg id="22">It is possible how the woman she could not but answer charge of bad taste?</seg>
		<seg id="23">Or the journalists of Komsomolskaya Pravda claiming couple of days ago are right, what it &quot;fell into even bigger trance under house arrest&quot; because of news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with the wife and his return to a family bosom?</seg>
		<seg id="24">The famous military observer of &quot;KP&quot; Victor Baranets in the article &quot;Serdyukov returned to the wife?&quot; wrote: &quot;Investigators do not exclude that after such shock it can become more talkative on interrogations&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The Minister of Transport baroness Kramer noted that the project &quot;will unite Great Britain&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Minister of Transport of Scotland Keith Brown told that it works on the plan, &quot;delighted&quot; with prospect, with the government of Great Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The first Stage will consist in construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">When the Second Stage is complete, lines will be laid to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In June the government reconsidered estimated cost of construction of the high-speed line between London and the North of England from £32,7 to £42,6 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The government of Great Britain which conducts negotiations with Transport Scotland, charged to HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements of capacity of the railroad and reduction of duration of trips for Northern England and Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It has to include opportunity to overcome a way from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Baroness Kramer told: &quot;Our purpose on HS2 - to create rather national network which will make Great Britain and its cities is closer to each other&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">We develop HS2 because benefits which it will bring, are huge.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Without it we will face crisis of capacity in our railway system.</seg>

		<seg id="13">The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today's announcement — good news to Scotland&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On behalf of the Scottish government Keith Brown urged Mr. Carmichael to support inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network &quot;unambiguously&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Brown told: &quot;The high-speed railroad has every chance to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for the high-speed railroad across all Great Britain&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Therefore we are glad to work in partnership with the government of Great Britain to consider options of construction of the high-speed railroad in Scotland, creations of benefit for all and continuations of the railway line Glasgow — Edinburgh which already plans the Scottish government.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Results of Sony from July till September, 2013 were more depressing, than it was expected that is connected with decline in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers of production of Japanese corporation.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The television business of Sony which in the II quarter brought to the company operating profit, the first for three years, of 5,2 billion yens again fell in the reporting period to 9,3 billion yens of an operational loss.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Japanese market of consumer electronics goes through difficult times, especially because of decrease in demand for TVs.</seg>
		<seg id="5">And while competitors seek to look for an exit from a difficult situation, Sony continues to concentrate on a consumer segment.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For example, one of the main rivals of Sony, Panasonic corporation, displaces emphases on industrial accessories recently: here sales to the company grow high rates, especially at the expense of automobile systems and environmentally friendly technologies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">As a result by the end of fiscal year which will come to the end in March, 2014, Sony expects to get 179 billion yens of operating profit against 230 billion yens expected earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Thus, according to Thomson Reuters agency, analysts assumed that this indicator will be much higher and will make 221 billion yens.</seg>

		<seg id="2">As the Izvestiya newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the State Duma Energy Committee Oleg Mikheyev reports, are already sent for obtaining the conclusion to the Supreme Court and the government.</seg>

		<seg id="4">As Mikheyev specifies, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for violation of formal signs of the government - a flag and the coat of arms.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Thus, according to the parliamentarian, protection of Russians which corns can be trodden on by both an insult of the state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, in the Russian legislation is worked insufficiently.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It gives the discussions which are developed annually on the eve of the Victory Day when some media persons dare to call into question a heroic feat of the people of the USSR in fight against fascists as an example.</seg>

		<seg id="10">Besides, according to Mikheyev, it is much more patriotically adjusted people in Russia, than religious, however thus the law punishes for an insult of feelings of believers, and it is possible to offend patriotic feelings almost with impunity.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to the people's deputy, it is necessary to equate an insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and to state the corresponding punishment in the 282nd article of the Criminal code.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Today council of the Civic Chamber (CC) can approve new structures of the public monitoring commissions (PMC) in 43 regions of Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">If the option put to the vote is accepted, lobbyists of security officers will increase the influence.</seg>
		<seg id="3">PMC - the public structures controlling conditions of keeping in imprisonment places.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Sergey Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhayev's affairs, disorders in a Kopeisk colony - through PMC become known the majority of resonant incidents behind a lattice.</seg>
		<seg id="5">For control over PMC there is a fight between human rights activists and lobbyists of security officers.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At a meeting of the OP working group on formation of PMC I suggested to make a selection criterion experience of human rights activity.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;It was not accepted, and formed lists, without having developed criteria&quot;, - Valery Borshchev tells.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Borshchev - the current chairman of the Moscow supervisory commission and Association of independent observers - the All-Russian structure of the human rights activists dealing with prison problems.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In stay by the deputy of the State Duma from &quot;Apple&quot; he developed the law regulating activity of PMC.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Council of OP has to vote for structures of PMC in 43 regions of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Less than one thousand persons interested apply for 1800 vacant places, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not organize because of the absence of candidates.</seg>
		<seg id="12">OP promises to organize a donabor on vacant places.</seg>
		<seg id="13">PMC of Moscow - one of the few commissions with competition in spite of the fact that in new structure instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.</seg>
		<seg id="14">According to Borshchev, in present structure of the capital commission of 11 human rights activists and 9 security officers, and in option which is on vote in OP, the ratio changes on 17 to 23.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Thus 30 human rights activists wanted to get to the capital commission.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the representative of &quot;A fighting brotherhood&quot; Vyacheslav Kalinin can repeatedly be a new part.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He was three years the member of PMC, but never visited prisoners.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Borshchev considers that security officers, having appointed the chairman of PMC, will be able to make work of human rights activists intolerable therefore human rights activists do not expel a collective exit from the commission.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In their opinion, advance of security officers is coordinated by the member of PMC Anton Tsvetkov heading &quot;Officers of Russia&quot; - the organization defending interests of power departments.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;I do not eat babies for breakfast&quot;, - declared RBC daily Anton Tsvetkov.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It denies that lobbies promotion of any lists and says that is not going to interfere with human rights activists to visit the arrested oppositionists.</seg>
		<seg id="22">According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested, for what list now vote in OP.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He considers publication of information by Borshchev as pressure form.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Possible success of human rights activists - the planned change of the management of the Chelyabinsk PMC.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Her former heads will be discharged because of last year's Kopeisk disorders.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In Civic chamber came to a conclusion that the management of the local commission ignored problems of prisoners.</seg>
		<seg id="27">And here the PMC of Rostov-on-Don can pass from human rights activists to security officers.</seg>
		<seg id="28">From new lists the human rights activist chairman of the local commission &quot;was gone&quot;, but there was one of his opponents in spite of the fact that in May, 2013 the federal Civic chamber excluded it for unethical behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Borshchev considers lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions as &quot;as revenge for Kopeysk&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's exposures did not affect PMC of Mordovia which consider &quot;power&quot;: only one human rights activist wanted to get to new structure, and at her did not even accept documents for competition.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The member of council of OP Nikolay Svanidze told RBC daily that voted against the offered list as he is revolted by a situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.</seg>
		<seg id="32">It dispatched the position to other members of council.</seg>

		<seg id="34">The deputy secretary of OP Vladislav Grib who is also the employee of FSIN Research institute coordinated drawing up lists of PMC.</seg>

		<seg id="3">But in a network bloggers already actively sneer concerning a memorable banknote.</seg>
		<seg id="4">After presentation of the Olympic note on October 30 they paid attention that the image of the snowboarder from a banknote can be found in photobanks.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In particular - in free storage of a photo of StockExchange where this photo is dated 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The same photo is used in the lesson of Photoshop published on the Russian site &quot;Megaobzor&quot; on January 18, 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Besides, it was already used in advertizing of RugGear smartphones.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Olympic banknote is executed in blue-blue scale.</seg>
		<seg id="9">On the one hand the snowboarder flying over Sochi with another - a type of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird is represented.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The author of design of a banknote - Pavel Bushuyev who won competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts of a name of Repin.</seg>
		<seg id="11">On presentation it was noted that some sports - alpine skiing were considered, freestyle and ski jumping, but as a result chose a snowboard as it is rather young sport.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to the source &quot;News&quot;, close to the Central Bank, the regulator the opinion of the public of rather wide dissemination of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknote is not indifferent and now study a situation.</seg>

		<seg id="14">The head of the press service Gosznaka Natalya Nikiforova declared to &quot;News&quot; that all reasonings concerning plagiarism are ridiculous.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The snowboarder on a banknote will turn to the right, in photos in a network - to the left, - Nikiforova specified.</seg>

		<seg id="17">She also noted that laws on copyright do not extend on the Olympic banknote as the artist got paid for work.</seg>
		<seg id="18">According to experts, discussion round the image on the Olympic note is positive at all.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recognition of the image on the note - plus for its advance, - is considered by the executive director of NP &quot;Rusbrend&quot; Alexey Popovichev.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Rosbalt agency deprived of the status of mass media for obscene abuse</seg>
		<seg id="1">On October 31 the Moscow City Court decided to recognize invalid the license about registration of Rosbalt agency, - &quot;Tape&quot; writes.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Drew Roskomnadzor on deprivation of agency of the status of mass media - for systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="3">During process unpleasant precedent was created: the court counted possible to close mass media, having actually refused to the edition the right to put forward counterarguments.</seg>
		<seg id="4">What is &quot;Rosbalt&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">JSC Rosbalt News Agency was founded in St. Petersburg in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the next years the agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Also representations in the countries of the former USSR work for agency.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since 2001 &quot;Rosbalt&quot; developed and functioned as federal information and analytical agency.</seg>
		<seg id="9">To the middle of the 2000th the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private internet mass-media in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Thus &quot;Rosbalt&quot; always occupied quite specific niche: notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies were the center of exclusive publications of agency (and make still).</seg>
		<seg id="11">Talk on proximity of the edition to power structures proceeded throughout existence of agency.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Along with that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; had extensive base of sources in various departments, such assumptions were spoken well also with that the project Natalya was at the head of Chaplin - Victor Cherkesov's wife.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus Chaplina's role in the management of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is up to the end not clear: most often she is called &quot;project manager&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The CEO of agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief - Nikolay Ulyanov.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Recently &quot;Rosbalt&quot; did not appear in ratings of federal mass media - neither on a quoting, nor on audience.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In October the agency took the 25th place in a rating of attendance of the sites of the Russian mass media according to LiveInternet.</seg>
		<seg id="17">According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru makes about 150 thousand unique visitors (and to 500 thousand viewings), monthly - about three million unique visitors.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Among the most popular materials for the last five months - a note about helplessness of the Kremlin in the relations with Ukraine, death of the soloist of King and Clown group, riots in capital Biryulev.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The conflict of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; to Roskomnadzor began in July, 2013 when the amendments to the law on mass media which forbade to journalists obscene abuse came into force.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Department found the forbidden lexicon in two videos published on the site of agency (&quot;The Dzhigit from Krasnodar&quot; and &quot;The Pussy Riot was profaned by oil derricks&quot;).</seg>
		<seg id="21">Further the parties describe differently.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Roskomnadzor on the basis of the found video records accused &quot;Rosbalt&quot; of rough and systematic violation of the law about mass media and appealed to court with the requirement to select the license at agency.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In &quot;Rosbalt&quot; declared that claims of department are illegal: first, rollers were not an editorial matter, secondly, abusive words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, right after the prevention rollers were removed from the site.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Representatives of agency appealed against claims of Roskomnadzor in world court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, consideration of these complaints still proceeded.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However already the 25th the magistrate made the decision not in favor of &quot;Rosbalt&quot;: the editor-in-chief Nikolay Ulyanov was found guilty of violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles - on 10 thousand for each roller.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Obviously, it also predetermined a hearing outcome in Moscow City Court - if to give up thought that the outcome could be predetermined even earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="27">On October 31 the court made the decision to nullify the certificate on registration of &quot;Rosbalt&quot;, having actually deprived agency of the status of mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is impossible to tell that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; during this opposition remained alone.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (the application addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov was signed on October 10 by 26 deputies; the document was filed at the initiative of the CPRF).</seg>
		<seg id="30">Illegality of closing of the edition was declared by the head of the Union of journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow union of journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council of human rights Mikhail Fedotov.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the management of Roskomnadzor even provided it some guarantees of that business will not reach revocation of license.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The trial of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be to mass media in Russia today - a big question.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The British businessman created the first-ever ice cream shining in the dark by means of a jellyfish.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of a sea animal to develop the shining food.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He came to this idea, having read the scientific article about jellyfishes, and convinced scientists of China chemically to recreate the shining protein.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Ice cream reacts with language of the one who eats it, increasing the pH level in protein and forcing it to shine.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Chris says that as ice cream starts shining when reacts to heat of a mouth, it means that the more you lick, the it becomes brighter.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Charlie, the founder of the company on production of Lick Me, I Tasty ice cream, speaks: &quot;It is an improbable thing, but still at the most initial stage if to speak about production therefore you receive about 2 g of substance for £200&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Protein which we use in ice cream, reacts with your language at neutral pH.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Therefore when your mouth warms protein, it will increase the pH level and ice cream will start shining.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We tested it within several last months, and it seemed that it will be ideal to present it to the Halloween because it creates such remarkable shining effect.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It, perhaps, the most expensive ice cream of that I did because the luminescence of a jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
		<seg id="11">So each ball costs me about £140.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But it quite pleasant on taste.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The experimental company of Charlie located in Bristol is well-known for the unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of mosaic gold.</seg>

		<seg id="15">He told: &quot;I very much want to develop invisible ice cream&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It by definition is impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals of which ice cream consists, but I think that we will find a way to make it.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Syria destroyed the equipment for the chemical weapon</seg>
		<seg id="1">Syria destroyed all declared capacities for production of the chemical weapon, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons recognized.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This first stage of disarmament finished Damascus a day before an established period.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Till November 1 Syria had to destroy the production and other auxiliary objects intended for preparation of fighting toxic agents for application, the BBC reports.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Destruction of reserves of toxic agents or their chemical components has to be complete to the middle of 2014.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the representative of OPCW, now toxic agents are in the sealed storages.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The international inspectors went to Syria after on the suburb of Damascus on August 21 during chemical attack were lost, according to the USA, more than 1400 people.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The main task of inspectors was not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to make more chemical weapon - and to destroy infrastructure for mixing of chemicals and equipment of ammunition.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now will attentively watch these capacities not to allow their repair.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The following milestone - the middle of November: by this time OPCW and Syrians have to agree on the detailed plan of destruction of already available reserves of toxic agents.</seg>
		<seg id="10">There is a lot of questions.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Where they will be destroyed?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Who will provide for this purpose the equipment?</seg>
		<seg id="13">All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by the western intelligence services.</seg>
		<seg id="14">They with readiness will advise inspectors new objects for check if there are bases to suspect that Damascus is not up to the end frank.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The USA believe that this attack was carried out by active armed forces.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Syria and Russia insist that this work of the Syrian insurgents.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The world community demanded from the Syrian management - according to the agreement reached with mediation of Russia - to destroy or bring into a non-working state all capacities for production of shells, the poisoning gases and liquids and for filling of shells with these substances.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Now, when this stage is passed, destruction of the chemical weapon which is already available for the Syrian army has to become the following step.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It is supposed that in this arsenal there can be more than 1000 tons of the neuroparalytic toxic agents, skin and vesicant mustard gas and other forbidden chemicals which are stored in several tens different places.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is necessary for its destruction that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities for a start agreed on the schedule of actions - on it two weeks are taken away.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The head of field operations of OPCW Gerry Smith declared the BBC that his inspectors &quot;personally watched destruction of the equipment&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;They have no possibility of a message further production or mixing of the chemical weapon now&quot;, - he told.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the statement of OPCW it is said that inspectors visited 21 of 23 objects in Syria and were convinced that plants on production of shells and toxic agents either are destroyed, or are put out of commission.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The remained two objects are too dangerous to carry out there inspection, it is told in the document, but the equipment from there was transported and checked by specialists of OPCW.</seg>
		<seg id="25">According to Smith, process of destruction of infrastructure on production of the chemical weapon &quot;was especially difficult&quot; as it was necessary to work in the conditions of the proceeding conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="26">At the beginning of October of OPCW received Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, time to celebrate it at inspectors was not yet - they were too busy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives to Scots a choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">One more day, one more horror story about independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the all-European zone of free movement as a condition of membership in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The turn of stories about passport control in Bervike and border with a barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall comes.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, the Strathclyde newspaper indicated possible economic benefits from more free movements across other Europe though — that is predictable — it did not appear in headings.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Anybody also did not specify that EU Member States spend a lot of time for turning the formal rules as it is convenient to them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As Scotland is not included now to the Schengen area, continuation of non-compliance with requirements will become a cheap concession for Brussels instead of what it really wanted from Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So it is the history which is not deserving attention.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And such old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard &quot;duck&quot; that &quot;independence means passport control&quot;, at least 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And still there is an interesting moment lost when retelling the ancient fairy tale.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why in general independent Scotland has to execute orders of Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why to change a yoke of London for a yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe at last stopped.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With eurocrisis the Europe project is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In all European Union the parties opposing the EU or for cancellation of euro as single currency gain strength.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany the party of eurosceptics &quot;Alternative of Germany&quot; — founded only in this year — appeared from nowhere and received nearly five million votes on September federal elections, thus in fact having forced out &quot;Free democrats&quot; (analog of ours of &quot;Liberal democrats&quot;) from the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Always there was an internal opposition to the plan of creation of federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless the current economic crisis became a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity measures entered by Berlin and the European central bank and the fetters imposed on national economies through preservation of single currency led many people to thought that the Europe project went too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Crisis of euro is a little connected with that the national governments work at excessive budget deficits — it was fair only for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Actually the eurosystem blocked the members on the exchange rates favorable to the German exporters — that the German politicians and want to keep.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without possibility of devaluation of national currency Southern Europe appears in in advance unprofitable situation on production capabilities in comparison with Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only life-saver — to cut down salaries and the public expenditures that is actively supported by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the current problems of the budget and currency there is deeper problem of productive abilities of Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of a package of measures on &quot;green&quot; energy, introduced by Brussels — the code meaning subsidizing of the French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer — the European industry pays twice more for electricity four times more for gas, than in the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It paralizuyushche adverse price conditions as we already saw in Greyndzhmuta.</seg>
		<seg id="26">No freezings of salaries in the world will stop a shattering victory of cheap slate gas of the USA over the European petrochemical industry.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result becomes ripe revolt, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After war the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and to put Paris on one level with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin does not need Paris as in means of obtaining political legitimacy any more, and already imposed own economic policy to Europe, having left the destroyed economy of France in a distress.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result — the right, opposing the EU Marine Le Pen's party &quot;National front&quot; just won a decisive by-election, having dumped ruling party of socialists on the third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;Front&quot; is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of votes now — the timely prevention to the British labourists that it is impossible to proceed from the assumption that split among the right will automatically affect in favor of the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What Le Pen with the new found popularity among the French white working class does?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use elections to the EU next year to create the block in the European parliament against the EU and against single currency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If — and it is very probable — the parties incited against the EU will get support on these elections, such block will be able to reach for the first time a dominant position in the European parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here my opinion: soon the growing moods against the EU and against single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it again will become something like indistinct &quot;Europe (sovereign) nations&quot; which was pleasant to General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and some economies, dependent on it, can keep euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I assume that Great Britain separates from this project, hoping to approach with the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific Ocean indicates probability of that Great Britain will remain unaddressed in cold of Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In what situation it leaves Scotland?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to become the region (in fact) to Small England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can protect own economic interests that means, in addition, to send Berlin and Brussels to devils.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within more free European arrangement provided that we will keep the currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other countries adherents will be simpler in not federal Europe of the nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise we should consider possibility of repetition of experience of Norway and preservation of our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The government of the Scotch national game in Scotland is — strangely enough — the most successful political movement in Europe directed against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 thanks to objections against the cuts in expenditure offered (and realized) the labor chancellor of treasury Alistair Darling and the coalition of the Tory and liberal democrats which arose subsequently.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be now ridiculous to Scotland to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: aging earlier</seg>
		<seg id="1">Afro-American and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach a sexual maturity earlier, than their white contemporaries, show researches.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are no certificates of that hormones or other chemicals are guilty</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts consider that epidemic of obesity can be one of starting mechanisms of early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The tendency to an early sexual maturity is not so expressed at boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge — the journalist specializing on children's health and family questions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Whether mother should be frightened if at her daughter rudiments of a mammary gland start being formed and raise pubic hair in 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At annual conference of the American academy of pediatrics this week to Orlando, the State of Florida, the children's endocrinologist doctor Paul Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are quite widespread among the American girls and represent new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend much time, calming parents — usually it does not mean fast approach of a full sexual maturity&quot; — Kaplovitts told.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair and a smell of a body, appear at girls earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there was only a small shift aged to a menarkha (the first periods) for the last four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States middle age makes 12,5 years and decreased in comparison with 12,75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;After the breast starts developing, passes at least two-three years to a menarkha&quot; — Kaplovitts who is also the author of the book &quot;Early puberty at girls told: how to cope with this widespread problem&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time — the most exact check of how puberty will progress.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Discussion that represents the actual approach of a sexual maturity is conducted, but it is considered &quot;premature&quot; when the increase in a breast is followed by sharp increase in growth till 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases process will be slowed down or will stop — it that the pediatrician can attentively trace.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Faster progressing can form the basis for analyses at the endocrinologist to exclude serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are procedures to detain early periods and to prevent one more consequence: presenilation of bones which eventually can lead to delay of growth and low growth at mature age.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations about medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on age of the child, a level of development, growth rates and an emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplovitts is careful with drugs, but recognizes that &quot;suppression of puberty can soften behavioural problems and feelings of girls that they differ from contemporaries&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Other big problem is clear: parents simply do not want that their very young daughters had periods.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They worry about risk of pregnancy or even how they will cope with hygiene questions&quot; — Kaplovitts told.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was shock&quot; — one woman at which daughter of periods began in 10 years remembers.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Though there were signs and we spoke about periods, it was not emotionally ready.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It came home from school scared and upset with that it the first among the girlfriends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are a lot of advertized theories about the reasons of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Nevertheless there are no consecutive proofs of that hormones are guilty of milk or other foodstuff, chemicals in environment or sexual messages in mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">At boys — as well as at girls — puberty comes earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplovitts claims that the prerequisite which has the greatest weight, is epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In 2001 he helped to conduct research of girls from 6 to 9 years which connects amount of fat in an organism with puberty terms.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are a lot of other promoting factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country Afro-American and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach a sexual maturity earlier, than their white contemporaries.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Around the world early puberty is influenced, most likely, by everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Still riddle: though boys have a face hair and on a pubis appear at younger age, the tendency to full early puberty is not so expressed, as at girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed complexity of this subject.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Emergence of spots and pubic hair meets even at babies and children of yaselny age.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We have to be careful how we define true approach of a sexual maturity&quot; — Dr. Lawrence Silverman, the children's endocrinologist in children's hospital of Goriyeb to Morristaun, the State of New Jersey told.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to receive the instruction from the pediatrician how to speak with the child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;It can mean earlier, than it was expected, conversation&quot; — Kaplovitts explained.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you keep calm, your child, as a rule, will react well.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The royal bank of Scotland temporarily discharged of work of two traders in the division on currency transactions, according to information of two people familiar with this situation that is one more confirmation of that global check by regulators of alleged manipulations in the currency market promptly grows.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the investigations connected with the world's largest financial market which daily turn makes $5,3 trillion.</seg>
		<seg id="3">These two traders will be the first employees of RBS discharged during the developed investigation which has something in common with the scandal connected with manipulations with an interbank rate of LIBOR.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Having refused to comment on discharges, the bank confirmed that this month it received requests for providing information from regulators.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;Our current investigation of this question proceeds, and we completely cooperate with FCA and other our regulators&quot; — reported in bank two weeks ago.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Last month the informed persons told that RBS transferred records of e-mail and instant messages which received and the former trader, to regulator of Great Britain — to Management on control of financial activity (FCA) sent it.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, it was granted leave at its current position of the head of the European spot currency auction in JPMorgan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Rokhan Ramchandani, the head of the European spot auction in Citi, went on leave this week while Matt Gardiner, the former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was discharged of work as Standard Chartered bank this week.</seg>
		<seg id="9">None of these traders were not accused of any violations.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The group of contacts of instant messages of Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the informed persons.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The UBS bank reported this week that it took measures against some employees after the Swiss Finma regulator told that he investigates alleged manipulations in the currency market in a number of the Swiss banks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At least six regulators in the world — the European commission, Finma, antimonopoly authority of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice of the USA and Currency management of Hong Kong — consider statements that bankers entered arrangement for impact on the currency market.</seg>
		<seg id="13">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for providing information from regulators, persons, familiar with a situation, told.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Banks look through instant messages and e-mails for some years in search of cases of offenses.</seg>
		<seg id="15">News about checks stirred up traders in the field of activity which was in recent years one of the largest sources of the income of trade divisions of investment banks which this year, however, met difficulties in view of the fact that low volatility of currencies reduces favorable opportunities for dealers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Some bankers tried to diminish gravity of a situation, saying that the extensive and highly liquid currency market cannot almost be manipulated, but the senior traders say that it is not always right.</seg>
		<seg id="17">According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of the daily auction in the currency market, fragmentation of liquidity between various trade platforms and wider use of the internal platforms by banks means that &quot;you can start having impact on the market for absolutely small price&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This news came on the same day when the Credit Suisse bank declared that dismissed one of traders of the department of the share auction of the London exchange this week after that caused losses of nearly 6 million dollars at the end of last year.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The bank immediately notified appropriate authorities and cooperates with the regulators.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The Secretary of State also recognized that is guilty, along with Barack Obama, that was &quot;on the autopilot&quot; during emergence of loud exposures of Edward Snowden about espionage activity of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="3">These information leakages put the U.S. Government in the center of diplomatic scandal with the allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Speaking by video conference at open government conference in London, Mr. Carrey told: &quot;There are no doubts that the president and I, and also other members of the government actually apprehended some occurring things on the autopilot because such opportunity already existed — both during World War II, and in very difficult years of cold war, and, of course, on September 11&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Then he became the first high-ranking member of the government of the USA who recognized that espionage of the USA went too far, but emphasized that the nobody's rights were not violated.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He told: &quot;In certain cases it came improperly far.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And the president is full of determination to shed light on the matter and to speak before people, and now carries out the careful analysis in order that anybody had no feeling of abuses.</seg>

		<seg id="17">— And I go to Europe to let to them know that we have to continue to cooperate in area of fight against terrorism, despite their anger concerning these programs of the NSA&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="18">News about that the NSA collected millions of records of telephone conversations in Europe, worsened the relations with some allies of the USA though the agency head declared this week that they were inexact and reflected misunderstanding of metadata which were collected by allies on NATO and which they shared with the USA.</seg>

		<seg id="25">He told that the European leaders have to be honest with the people in what espionage programs they used for many years.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Halloween 2013 in numbers</seg>
		<seg id="1">When I was small, the Halloween was magic.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To us allowed to eat candies with the sister, late not to go to bed and arrange a masquerade for our area.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Now I resemble the miser more.</seg>
		<seg id="4">I did not volunteer to distribute in the last two years candies in the apartment and, most likely, I will not become and this year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">However the statistics shows that I am the black sheep in that, as for the Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="6">According to National federation of retail trade, most of Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate the Halloween this year and will spend in total $6,9 billion for candies, suits and jewelry.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The only thing that I wait for each Halloween — is trends.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The national federation of retail trade predicts that on suits $1,2 billion from the spent $6,9 billion will leave.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This year at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is not obligatory for women to be representatives of sexual professions any more; they can also be sexual food, for example pizza, hamburgers or carrots.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As for men, I think, we will see a great number of the zombie thanks to &quot;Walking dead persons&quot;, and I am sure that astronauts in style of Daft Punk group will get to our tapes Instagram this year.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Google, suits which look for most often — it is the zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Perhaps, there is nothing bad in traditional approach.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, we were not only.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Moreover, according to National federation of retail trade, Americans will spend this year $330 million for suits for pets.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It means many ridiculous dogs-hotdogov.</seg>
		<seg id="17">When business reaches candies, we do not waste time on trifles.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Americans will spend for them $1,9 billion this year, according to the Nielsen company.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These are about 600 million pounds of chocolates of Hershey, sugar candies, Milk Duds candies, the Twizzlers chewing candies and bars of Clark Bar.</seg>
		<seg id="20">According to the Ministry of Trade of the USA, it is excellent news to 41 million demanding candies of children which were going to submit our areas.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Moreover, we will buy and — we will not deceive ourselves — we will eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during the Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only thing that we do not want to use — these are candies in the form of corn grains; and nevertheless, according to National association of confectioners, nearly 35 million their pounds are on sale under the Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="23">These are about 9 billion separate corn kernels.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is a riddle which I still should solve.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Anything so does not express the Halloween essence as haunted houses.</seg>
		<seg id="26">They have tremendous names, for example &quot;Horror behind walls&quot; (which, by the way, is in the real prison), &quot;Howl also shout&quot; and &quot;The house of shock&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Moreover, according to society America Haunts, in America there are 1200 officially recognized haunted houses generating about $500 million the income, and also those tremendous photos where you were almost described which your friend laid out on Facebook, and you cannot clean, and then that guy who is pleasant to you, sees this photo and leaves the comment it seems &quot;a cool look&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And in summary we will talk about pumpkins.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Charlie Brown acquainted us with Great Pumpkin when we were children, and cutting of the lamp of Jack — it as decoration of a Christmas fir-tree, that we do since the childhood.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fortunately for us, the fashion on the child in pumpkin began only last year thanks to Pinterest so the majority of us grew, cutting out these pumpkins, but without sitting in them.</seg>
		<seg id="31">According to bureau of population census of the USA, this year Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Jack's lamp which is slowly drying on your porch probably arrived from the State of Illinois which grew up 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
		<seg id="33">If you want a task more difficult, visit Tim and Susan Metisdon in the city of Napa of the State of California and try to cut out something from their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In a pawnshop in shopping center Bendemir in Singapore Dzhanani Amirtkhalinga puts a gold bracelet, a ring and earrings to pay school training of the daughter.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;My husband and I just bought the house so all my money is invested there&quot; — Mrs. Amirtkhalinga speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Though she also earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as the administrator and her husband too works, it is not enough monthly income of a family, she speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Really, demand — where the volume of debt of households grows in various parts of Southeast Asia — such is that ValueMax where she carries out the transaction, this week became the third pawnshop registered at stock exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The credit on the security of jewelry — it not simply fast way to receive money (S$1300 in case of Mrs. Amirtkhalinga), but also is almost also cheap, as the poor bank credits.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Usually pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate in 17% — slightly higher than 15,4% offered in office of United Overseas Bank, the local creditor with branch in the same shopping center.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However pawnshops have that advantage that they do not demand check of solvency or proofs of a salary and can issue the credits quicker, than banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Therefore millions of people in all region address in pawnshops as families feel pressure because of increase of cost of life and rapid growth of debt of households and consumer debts.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of the steady growth which followed world financial crisis, and the cheap credits fed with a free monetary policy in the countries with developed economy, families handle the low and average level of the income in pawnshops to compensate reduction of the income in process of delay of growth of their economies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, specified increase in a family credit shoulder, generally because of growth of a mortgage, as risk factor for solvency of Asian banks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It declared that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of a debt of households to gross domestic product in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia headed this list from 80% of GDP in comparison with 60% in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists are also concerned by the high level of a consumer debt in Thailand which this week hardly left technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday data showed the proceeding decrease in export and weakening of a consumer demand.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;An essence that with an increase in prices people in the middle and lower part [a scale of the income] will look for ways to fill up the income where will be able only&quot; — tells Song Seng Woon, the economist of CIMB, Malaysian bank.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Record-breaking high prices of gold in the last two years strengthened haste with which people put the personal belongings as they use opportunity to receive money for the family jewelry.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore about 70% of the things put in 200 lombard points of the city-state are gold products.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People speak: &quot;Price of gold looks good, let's put a gold chain of the grandmother and we will receive it back next month&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand the largest operator of pawnshops of EasyMoney observed growth of number of the clients using its offices in recent months up to 20%.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Growth in lombard business such is that ValueMax, the operator of office in Bendemire and 15 of others same in Singapore, plans to extend not only in the next Malaysia where it has four shops, but also outside Asia too, Yeakh Li Ching, the executive director of ValueMax speaks.</seg>

		<seg id="3">In his opinion, distribution of this information promotes maintenance of the myth about so-called Russian mafia which allegedly works abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="4">As wrote earlier, yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department published the list of alleged members of criminal group &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot; on the site.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Among them also the Russian singer Grigory Leps was called.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Black box at you in the car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Still American designers of roads try to find money for repair of the scattered system of highways, many start seeing the decision in the small black box which is accurately attached on the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">These devices tracing everyone proyezzhayemy the motorist mile and transferring this information to officials are in the center of a disputable attempt of modernization of outdated system of financing of highways of America made by planned bodies of Washington and staff.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Usually boring arena of planning of highways unexpectedly generated intensive debate and picturesque alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarians joined ecological groups in lobbying of providing the right of use of small boxes to the government for tracking of quantity proyezzhayemy you miles and even, perhaps, where you pass them, - and uses then this information by drawing up tax accounts.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Movement of tea drinking shocked.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American union of civil liberties is also deeply concerned and lifts a number of questions of rather private life.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And though the congress cannot agree, continue yet or not, some states are not going to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They reflect how within the next decade it is possible to pass to system at which drivers pay for each mile of the road which they pass.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists already took these black boxes part from which have function of satellite tracking on testing.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is really necessary for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It not that question on which we can have an option&quot;, – Hassan Ikhrata, the executive director of Association of the governments of South California who prepares plans at first of tracking by authorities of the state of miles, proyezzhayemy each Californian motorist, for 2025 told.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be changes how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Technologies for this purpose already are.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Need of it is aggravated with lack of means at Government Fund of the construction of highways financed by taxes which Americans pay at gas stations.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Americans do not buy a lot of gasoline, as earlier any more.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars pass more miles on one gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax, 18,4 cents for gallon, did not raise 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians do not want to raise a tax even on one cent at the high prices of gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The tax on gasoline cannot simply be kept&quot;, – Li Mannich, the expert in transport policy at University of Minnesota told.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In its staff it was established on cars of 500 tracing devices for testing of system of pomilny payment recently.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;It will be the best alternative in the long term&quot;, – he told.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Bores call it a pomilny user payment.</seg>
		<seg id="23">No wonder that this idea attracts city liberals as by means of taxes it will be possible to change character of trips for decrease in load of roads and emissions of greenhouse gases, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Planned bodies in California look narrowly at this system during development of strategy for achievement of the target indicators established by ambitious laws of this state on fight against global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However the member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (the republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of transport committee of chamber, told that he too considers this system as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Adherents of the free market in Reason fund of also delighted that will force drivers to pay for each mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;It not simply a tax which will go to a black hole&quot;, – Adrian Moore, the vice-president for political affairs of Reason told.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People directly pay for that they receive.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This movement is also supported by two former Ministers of Transport of the USA who in 2011 urged the congress to move in the direction of pomilny payment.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The senate of the USA approved the pilot project worth 90 million dollars in which about 10 000 cars would take part last year.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this offer because of fears of the rural legislators representing voters who in everyday life quite often should pass many miles to reach for work or to the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Some states and the cities, nevertheless, go on this way independently.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the State of Oregon where for participation in the largest experiment in the country 5000 drivers are attracted.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will pay staff for run miles instead of a tax on gasoline soon.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Nevada the pilot project is already complete.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In New York it is considered.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois will test it on a limited basis with participation of trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the coalition of I-95 which includes transport departments of 17 states of east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studies as they will be able to carry out these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This concept was not generally recognized.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned by that the government can trace each their step.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concern about &quot;the big brother&quot; and similar things represents a big problem&quot;, – Alauddin Khan managing questions of strategy and management of efficiency in department of transport of the State of Nevada told.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It was not that people wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When tests went at full speed, the office of the American union of civil liberties in the State of Nevada warned on the website: &quot;It will be absolutely simple to turn these devices into devices of full-scale tracking&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure which will inevitably extend for storage of records about daily movements of certain citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada - one of several states where difficult searches of inexpensive technology which would allow authorities of the state to keep account proyezzhayemy the car of miles, but without information on a place and time are conducted.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you are able to make it, Khan told, society will feel more quietly.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Searches of this technology led some agencies of staff to the small young company in California under the name True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Initially this company was not engaged in assistance in taxation of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She sought to enter an emerging market of a type of car insurance at which drivers pay on the basis of run.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But devices which it tests, involve designers of roads because they do not use GPS and provide limited amount of information, periodically loaded by means of the modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People will be more inclined to do it if you do not trace their speed and do not trace their location&quot; — Ryan Morrison, the executive director of True Mileage told.</seg>
		<seg id="52">There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot programs of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are much less expensive and less persuasive ways to make it.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon designers experiment granting various options to drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose the device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they can refuse absolutely the device, having decided to pay instead the fixed collecting on the basis of average of miles which is passed by all inhabitants of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="57">In other places hope to sell idea of the guarded public, having forced devices to do more, and it is not less.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York transport officials seek to develop the nalogooblagayushchy device which will also accept payment on parking counters, to provide &quot;pay as you go&quot; an insurance and to collect a pool of data on speed in real time from other drivers which motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists will be recruited by benefit which to them will be offered&quot; — it is told in the document of town-planning design.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some designers of transport systems, however, reflect on, whether all talk on pomilny payment by simply huge distracting factor is.</seg>
		<seg id="61">In the city transport commission in the field of the gulf San Francisco officials say that the congress could overcome very simply bankruptcy of confidential Fund of construction of highways, having lifted taxes on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="62">The additional single or annual tax could be raised from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons, whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid the fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you need to do is — it to take aspirin&quot; — Randi Rentshler, the director of the commission on the legislation and the public relations told.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we make it, hundreds of millions drivers will worry about the private life and a set of other things.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will build in a dignity of new cardinals of Catholic church for the first time for the term of the service on February 22 as declared Vatican on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Cardinals are the highest clergy in Catholic church after the father, and they elect fathers so Francis will appoint the first group of people who will participate eventually in a choice of his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Now there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However after achievement of 80-year age by the cardinal he cannot take part in the father's elections any more — it is a prerogative of group of 120 &quot;cardinals-electors&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Declaring this news, the press secretary of Vatican father Federico Lombardi told that before a construction ceremony in a dignity the meeting of all current cardinals known as a consistory will be held.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis decided to report in advance about the decision to call a consistory in February to facilitate planning of other meetings with participation of cardinals from different corners of the world&quot; — Lombardi told.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices organization told that by February the number of cardinals-electors probably will decrease.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He told that usually the father calls so many cardinals, how many it is necessary again to finish number of cardinals-electors to 120, and also so many cardinals are aged more senior than 80 years, how many he will wish.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first from the moment of Francis's election in March of this year, according to Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the moment there is some kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to look, whether the new father of cardinals from other regions of the world for restoration of balance will appoint&quot; — he noted.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In South America live forty percent of Catholics, but they are presented by insignificant number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It will also be the first elected cardinals since formation of cardinals by Francis Soveta — groups of eight cardinals from around the world it is entrusted to them to look for ways of reforming of church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past the father solved everything independently.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now Francis elected eight cardinals that they helped him&quot; — Valero told.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He told that &quot;it is quite possible&quot; that Francis will address to cardinals for council.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But we were not in such situation before — all this for us for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero told that fathers usually built in a position of the cardinal of bishops from large arrivals, but Francis &quot;is full of surprises — therefore we do not know whom he will call&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Within action there passed the presentation of the new line on production of electrowelded pipes from steel.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov told, in 2011 with the advent of the new owner market research on studying of a sales market of steel structures in the Tyumen region is conducted.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It became clear that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electrowelded pipes a month.</seg>
		<seg id="4">After that the decision on change of a profile of plant and installation on it of the equipment for their production was made.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This year more than 7 thousand tons of the made production are shipped.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Investments into plant made more than 120 million rubles, - Denis Gribanov told.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In October the new camp that allows to increase the range is started.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At plant is issued as a small profile of a pipe which is used for hothouse economy, of small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and large - for construction branch.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We plan to reach level of production of 50 thousand tons of production a year that will make about 10 percent from its consumption in the Tyumen region.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Despite transition to other kind of activity, number of employees at the enterprise it was not reduced - now it makes 157 people, in plans when purchasing the new equipment - increase in the personnel even more than on 50 workers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">At the enterprise there is a retraining of personnel, and necessary experts are selected from the already available.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Next year it is planned to enter the new unit of the longitudinal became sharp up to five millimeters thick that will allow to reduce product cost, and also one more camp, with a speed of production of a pipe to 47 meters per minute.</seg>
		<seg id="13">By the end of 2014 at the enterprise are going to master release of pipes which are used in housing and communal services.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The management of the enterprise sets a task to close to 70 percent of need of the Tyumen region for this production.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The deputy director of department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing to heads of productions, advised to pay bigger attention to modernization of machine-building enterprises.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Forms of the state support of the industry which include compensation of interest rates for the credits for purchase of the new equipment and expenses on its leasing also are directed on it.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the current year is provided to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two thirds of this sum are already spent.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The last commission which will consider contracts of subsidizing, accepts documents from the enterprises till November 15.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Besides, the budget compensates costs of participation of local producers in the international fairs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Next year the budget provided means of 150 million rubles which can be used for compensation of leasing payments and the credits for acquisition of the new equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="21">5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - on programs of energy saving.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Decrease to 72 million rubles of funds for compensation of the ordered and paid equipment which is made in the south of the Tyumen region for an oil and gas complex.</seg>
		<seg id="23">According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the long term this form of support will stop as compensation of a tax on mining which the oil companies paid in the regional budget was motive of its introduction.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Now they do not do it and subsidies become direct account obligations of the region.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Taking into account it the government of area considers as the priority direct support of the industrial enterprises, but not financing through them oil branch.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The help of the budget will be connected with investment projects which will begin to be realized on production.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Many heads of the enterprises expressed concern in connection with the developing situation in the relations with oil industry workers.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The grant for the equipment bought by them is competitive advantage of the industry of the South of the Tyumen region, and at its cancellation it will be difficult to compete at the price with a midland of Russia, where cheaper labor.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Besides, the question with continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - the Rosneft company which does not place the orders at the Tyumen enterprises yet is not clear.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The agreement on implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and demands for its extension did not arrive.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Now the enterprises of the South of area which specialize on the equipment for oil and gas sector, cannot create a portfolio of orders next year.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Open is a question, whether taxes from the oil extracted in the Uvat area will come to the budget of the region or they will be paid in a place of registration of the new owner of fields.</seg>

		<seg id="1">According to The New York Times, the closest advisers to the president Barack Obama secretly considered possibility of replacement of the vice-president Joe Biden with the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the electoral list of 2012.</seg>

		<seg id="14">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley, whether the boss of that time knew it about a possible reshuffle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Though Daley also told that he does not think that the president &quot;was aware&quot; of possible replacement, the former head of administration recognized that, &quot;probably&quot;, Obama knew.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Martin added that &quot;Rates are doubled&quot; does not give a definite answer on a question, whether results of political sounding reached Obama's table.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Russian brewers have a bad mood.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On their estimations, consumption of beer in the country next year remains at former level, and it at best.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Though businessmen initially counted on growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">After all this year develops for them unsuccessfully: sales fell to 7 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The head of one of the largest breweries of the country, the chairman of the board of the Union of the Russian brewers Isaak Sheps at the III annual conference of Institute of Adam Smith told &quot;Goods of daily demand in Russia&quot; which just came to the end in Moscow of all this.</seg>
		<seg id="6">On it discussed state regulation of the market.</seg>
		<seg id="7">From 2008 to 2012 the Russian market of beer was already reduced by 18 percent as in recent years in the country essential strengthening of regulation of brewing branch regarding production and a turn of beer - drink with the small content of alcohol is observed, - told to listeners of Sheps.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In one country of the world there is no such rigid restriction of the market of beer, unpredictable introduction all a new and new illogical ban which locate allegedly fight against alcohol abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The brewer complained that many legislative ban urged to reduce the level of abuse of alcohol has no special impact, nevertheless constantly there are all new initiatives.</seg>

		<seg id="15">To keep the profits, businessmen are compelled to go from the grades calculated on the mass consumer to the class &quot;premium&quot;: beer will become less, but it will be more expensive.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile, radical consequences from falling of sales with a small amount of alcohol it is not visible yet.</seg>

		<seg id="0">To what will give construction of TPU in Moscow</seg>
		<seg id="1">Every year authorities of the capital promise to equip more and more the transport and transfer knots (TTK).</seg>
		<seg id="2">Till 2020 it is planned to put into operation 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Than in practice the project is wrapped, our correspondent understood.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Few months ago the Smolensk subway of the Arbat and Pokrovsk line had a construction fence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The inscription said that there is an arrangement of transport and transfer knot.</seg>
		<seg id="6">All this was very strange as near &quot;Smolensk&quot; no land transport stops and, therefore, it is impossible to change on it.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To reach the next trolleybus stop on the Garden ring, it is necessary to overcome about 130 meters, including land transition through Karmanitsky Lane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now at &quot;Smolensk&quot; almost everything is finished.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The flower stall disappeared, the stand for newspapers is dismantled, and asphalt before an entrance was replaced by a stone blocks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Here and all transport knot.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Transport and transfer knots happen plane and capital, - explain in the press service of capital department of transport.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Capital TPU are not present so far.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And plane assume construction of parkings, a conclusion of the trade objects disturbing to the movement of passengers, creation of small architectural forms and improvement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Actually, even not transport workers, and professional blagoustroitel from department of capital repairs of the city of Moscow are engaged in plane TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The transport knot it is not obligatory a difficult design, - is explained by the director of Institute of transport economics and transport policy of Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Sometimes the roof over the head and boards notifying on a transport arrival time suffices.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here, for example, at the Yasenevo subway opened quite full-fledged plane transfer knot recently.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Let without canopies, but with the intercepting parkings and boards specifying when the bus will come.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But in a pursuit of quantity officials write down in TPU everything that popadya.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In 2011 the city hall planned to construct for everything about all 151 knots, of them 59 with capital construction.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Now in plans till 2020 appear already 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="22">From them one hundred and fifty is promised to hand over this year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Though in the city there is a program of development of TPU, is not designated any qualitative criteria, - Alexander Morozov, the cochairman of public organization &quot;City and Transport&quot; states.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Report by amount of objects, but quality of change on each of them often worsens.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Criteria, according to the expert, has to be two: first - reduction of time of change, secondly - convenience.</seg>
		<seg id="26">First of all opportunity to replace a type of transport, without leaving under a rain.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Moscow at arrangement of TPU sometimes leaves exactly on the contrary.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Striking example of the subway of &quot;ENEA&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Earlier suburban buses from Yaroslavskoye Highway came to the square before a main entrance in the All-Russia Exhibition Centre.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Now their stops moved to the opposite side of the Resident of Yaroslavl on Kosmonavtov Street.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Farther from the subway, is much farther from a monorail, but is closer to houses.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Though inhabitants did not want bus station under windows at all and complained to all possible instances.</seg>
		<seg id="33">With capital TPU in Moscow somehow at once it was not set.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The first of them started being built at the Glider subway about five years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The project was urged to become exemplary.</seg>
		<seg id="36">And really the sample of how the transfer knot assigned to investors turns into banal shopping center turned out.</seg>
		<seg id="37">No, there are platforms for buses, a canopy here not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parkings.</seg>
		<seg id="38">However, for the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU room was not made essentially.</seg>
		<seg id="39">They as strangers were removed far away from the subway.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But places under trade remained more.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Only one clothes 32 shops, and in general are almost everything - from zoogoods to a motor show.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Well really, suddenly who from passengers of the bus needs to buy on the way the new car?</seg>
		<seg id="43">At us when build capital TPU, for some reason the shopping center always turns out.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Recently the situation reached the logical end when the part of parking was decided to be given for the market.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Now on the third floor of TPU &quot;Glider&quot; among the parking spaces marked on a floor there is a brisk trade.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The vegetables, spices, the Chinese jeans, the non-russian speech and security guards who are spitefully glancing at our photographer.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The transfer knot finally turned into a market.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The matter is that earlier the Glider subway had a market, but it was born.</seg>
		<seg id="49">And in prefecture of dealers regretted and let on the intercepting parking of transfer knot.</seg>
		<seg id="50">All the same because of high prices it is always empty there.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The most ridiculous that demolished the market to construct on its place... new plane TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Such here castling.</seg>
		<seg id="53">At the Kaluga subway the approach distance from a subway lobby to the bus made 50 meters, - Alexander Morozov tells.</seg>
		<seg id="54">After construction of shopping center, allegedly TPU, distance increased to 170 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="55">To get on a bus, it is necessary to pass through all shopping center.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After 22 hours when it is closed, it is necessary to bypass it open-air.</seg>
		<seg id="57">However, designs on &quot;Glider&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot; will seem florets soon.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In the middle of September the urban planning and land commission of the city hall approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Four of them will be 25-storeyed, apart from two-three underground circles.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The main monster will grow up at the Tushino subway, in it there will be 418,7 thousand sq.m of the area.</seg>
		<seg id="61">The representatives of management of railway stations of the Russian Railway who are responsible for construction of TPU at the subway already told journalists: in future high-rise buildings shops, hotels and apartments will settle down.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Thus officials assure that many-tier parkings will borrow from a third to a half of the area.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Let's take for an example &quot;national&quot; garages.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Let's tell, garage on 258 parking places which was built on Mezhdunarodnaya Street recently, has the area of 8015 sq.m.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Means, the parking on 2,6 thousand cars at &quot;Petrovsky and Razumovskaya&quot; requires about 80 thousand of &quot;squares&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="66">It is less than a third of that large object which is going to be constructed there.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Let one-two floors will go to any platforms for buses.</seg>
		<seg id="68">There are at least 150 thousand sq.m of commercial real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="69">And it, for a minute, nearly two GUMA.</seg>
		<seg id="70">If capital TPU at stations and stations are built by railroad workers, other platforms will be mastered by metropolitenovets.</seg>
		<seg id="71">They too promised that there will be many &quot;objects of a functional purpose&quot;, including hotels, offices and even sports halls.</seg>
		<seg id="72">By the way, in department of property of the city of Moscow told recently to journalists that develop the draft of the resolution according to which investors will be able to address for receiving a site for TPU to officials directly.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Without any competitions.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Therefore supposedly that transport questions for the city - a priority.</seg>
		<seg id="75">Ideal TPU is, for example, Harvard stations in Boston or &quot;Spadayna&quot; in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.</seg>
		<seg id="76">There trolleybuses and trams go down under the earth on the level of the subway and distance of approach from the subway car to the tram makes only 50 meters without exit to the street.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Round any excess trade.</seg>
		<seg id="78">But throws the Moscow officials into extremes.</seg>
		<seg id="79">Or we will build nothing, or otgrokhay 25 floors with offices and apartments.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The Bombardier company located in Montreal also did not publish any data on flight tests of its latest CSeries plane and did not provide new information on, whether ambitious plans for introduction of the plane to commercial operation by next September will be implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft which took place about one and a half months ago it flew three more time that causes questions of, whether the stage of tests goes according to the schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Results did not justify forecasts and led to falling of actions more than for 8 percent at Toronto Stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doyerksen, the analyst of National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday the assessment with &quot;above average market&quot; to &quot;average market&quot; because of belief that growth of actions is limited in the next quarter or two.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Though decrease in number of deliveries of aircrafts was in general predictable, we are certainly disappointed with indicators of profit of transport department&quot; — Doyerksen in the review of stock market told.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will secure new orders for CSeries in process of continuation of the program of flight tests.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Nevertheless, if in the next months it is not declared new orders, we assume that the market will begin to be skeptical about the program more.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Bombardier company hopes that the family of the CSeries planes will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and for the first time made flight in September after several months of a delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However meanwhile it is not enough firm orders for CSeries — 177 as potential buyers wait for results of flight tests to check statements of the company about fuel efficiency and potential profitability of the new liner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In total now there are 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The chief executive officer Pierre Bodoin was sure that Bombardier will achieve the object in 300 firm orders by the time of when the first plane is brought into commercial operation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday heads also assured analysts and mass media that the program moves ahead according to the plan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test model of the plane did not remain on the earth more long, than it was expected&quot; — Boduan during telephone conference told, having added that land tests and updatings of the software were planned for an idle time of the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="16">All producers plan tests differently.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We decided to carry out the first flight and to make a break on updatings, so we and arrived.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Will occur so during all program of flight tests.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test samples has to make flight in the next weeks and all others will soon follow it as the company reported.</seg>
		<seg id="20">And still analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first client will be able to start operation of the CSeries plane in 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The Bombardier company declared that it estimates the term of commissioning and will provide new information in the following some months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slow rate of flight tests - though, most likely, also corresponds to the internal schedule of Bombardier - supports our point of view that commissioning will be postponed for the first quarter 2015&quot; — Doyerksen told.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter which terminated on September 30 net income of Bombardier was reduced to $147 million, or 8 cents for an action, from $172 million, or 9 cents for an action, last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The corrected earning per share remained former — 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The gross income was reduced slightly — from $4,2 to $4,1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts expected profit of 10 cents on an action and the gross income of $4,56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth in the world in size the producer of planes reported that he put 45 aircrafts in a quarter that is less than an indicator for previous year — 57.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Total number of orders fell with 83 to 26 planes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The portfolio of orders of aerospace department made $32,9 billion for September 30, without having changed since December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In aerospace area results answered our purpose, however the small number of the arriving orders and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor&quot; — Boduan told.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The gross income in the aerospace direction fell to 13 percent — to $2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest producer of trains, reported that the gross income in this sector grew almost by 11 percent — to $2,1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The portfolio of orders in transport division made $32,6 billion for September 30 that is a little higher than an indicator of December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Problems with execution of several large contracts negatively affected the income of transport division.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The management declared that in the fourth quarter the new development plan will be submitted.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Shares of the company of Bombardier which also declared that the chief financial director of Google corporation Patrick Pichett will be included into board of directors, fell to 8,5 percent — to С$4,83 at the auction in the middle of Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third in the world in size the commercial producer of planes and the closest competitor of Bombardier, reported on Thursday about reduction of the quarter income by 10 percent.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Two employees of YMCA are accused of sexual crimes even before charges against Johnathan Lord as the Royal commission knew</seg>
		<seg id="1">Two employees of YMCA NSW were accused of sexual crimes against children before promotion of charges in 2011 against the employee of institution on care of children in Karingbakh of Johnathan Lord, reported to the Royal commission on sexual violence over children.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But in an opening statement of the commission it was said that it &quot;never dealt with cases of sexual violence over children in the organization&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The chief executive officer Philipp Hare was asked about one case when the worker of YMCA was accused of the crimes connected with a child pornography and about other case when the instructor of the sports hall in YMCA Caringbah Hall was condemned for sexual crimes against the children who were under its supervision in 1991.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mr. Hare told Gale Ferness, to the lawyer giving help to the commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He recognized that YMCA in opening speech for the commission also allowed inaccuracy, claiming that &quot;there were external checks of YMCA which recognized that YMCA is on safety of children in the forefront&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The presented commissions of the certificate say that YMCA was notified that it received the second since the end from four possible estimates by results of audit of the quality executed by Department of Education and communities in August of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr. Hare who entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, recognized that it and the subordinate management allowed a miss, having employed the Lord, and also could not provide a clear understanding with the personnel of the obligations concerning the message on violations of a security policy of children.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Earlier this year the Lord was condemned for sexual crimes against 12 boys within two years of his work in YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was imprisoned at least for six years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Mr. Hare rejected the assumption that corporate ethics of YMCA prevented employees to report about violations of the Lord in the sphere of safety of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Employees gave evidences that they observed violations, including that the Lord was alone with children, personally looked after them, put them to itself on knees, said that he loves one of them and allowed them to play the mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Daniel Okvell which was under the direction of Lorda and asked to train it in protection of children because she was concerned by his behavior, testified that found Jackie Barnat, the guardianship manager over children of office of YMCA in Karingbakh which was the head Lorda, &quot;very frightening and often remote&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The executive director told that he does not accept an explanation of employees that it was awkward to them to report about a situation to the higher heads.</seg>
		<seg id="14">More likely, according to him, their friendship with the Lord took away them from thought of need to report about him.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hare told that he presented to council of YMCA of New South Wales the opinion that the lesson for the organization from &quot;incident with Johnathan Lord&quot; not &quot;concerns providing information&quot; from employees, and council agreed with it.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr. Hare declared that the decision to force employees to sign agreements on confidentiality soon after emergence of charges was made by the CEO of YMCA on guardianship over children Liam Wheatley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told that it was urged to prevent damage of proofs, but thus &quot;were overzealous&quot; and this decision badly realized.</seg>
		<seg id="18">YMCA of New South Wales was not the organization, safe for children, in operating time of Johnathan Lord in it during 2009-2011, the expert in problems of corruption of children professor Stephen Smolboun from Griffith University reported the commissions.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He told that there were &quot;serious problems&quot; at a set, selection, instructing, training of the personnel and control of it.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Hearings are postponed until December 20.</seg>

		<seg id="1">It is possible to claim safely that New York — this birthplace of the stendap-comedy in America: nearly hundred years ago the variety actor Frank Fae working as the compere at Palace Theatre theater at the Broadway started telling jokes directly to public in a colloquial manner.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Fae's innovation was picked up over time by others, quite recently - the New York comedy festival.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Created and supervised by Caroline Hyorsh, the foundress of Carolines stendap-club, the festival celebrates this year the tenth anniversary, totaling more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The majority of these headliners began in Carolines, and then achieved bigger success, reached the level when they are already too well-known to act in club&quot; — told Hyorsh.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We created this festival as a way to continue with them work.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This year action &quot;Stendap for heroes&quot; — an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Maddison Skver Garden where there will be among other Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Kosbi includes Wanda Sykes, Cathie Griffin and Bill Mar's performances, and also.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With expansion of a festival also the world of the comedy extended.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Some comedians participating in a festival this year gained popularity in the nonconventional way, for example thanks to show on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The nickname of Krall gained fame thanks to a role in comedy series on little-known cable TV channel (deliberately obscene &quot;League&quot; on FXX on a fantasy soccer), and now keeps own the sketch show on Comedy Central.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Jannie Sleyt was a cast as in &quot;Saturday evening on the air&quot;, and in &quot;Parks and recreation areas&quot; though most of all she is known on a series of virus rollers &quot;Marseille - a cockleshell in boots&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Both Krall, and Sleyt, as well as other young comedians with original style (surreal pessimistic Anthony Dzheselnik, the crafty, focused on racial subject by Camau Bell) — is result of the decentralized world of the American comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">David Steynberg's interview to Larry David will become one of the most high points of a festival.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Steynberg began as the stendap-comedian, but then became the successful director on television and at cinema, and also the informal historian of the comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="14">With 2005 on 2007 it was the anchorman on TV Land under the name Sit Down Comedy with David Steynberg.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The meeting will take place in the Town Hall hall in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;This city — it is unconditional, the central element of all work of Larry&quot; — Steynberg told.</seg>
