		<seg id="0">The matter NSA underlines the total absence of debates on the piece of information</seg>
		<seg id="1">How the contradictory attitude to explain of the French government, that of a quotation offends itself in public while summoning the ambassador of the United States October 21, and other forbids the flying over of the territory by the bolivian presidential airplane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence to his edge of Edward Snowden?</seg>
		<seg id="2">According to me, there are two levels of response from the French government.</seg>
		<seg id="3">When François Holland telephones Barack Obama or when the minister of the foreign affairs Laurent Fabius summons the ambassador of the United States, they react to a true discovery, that is the one of the extent of the American supervision on the body of the communications in France.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Not is it surprising to read in the columns of the World to some weeks of interval on one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listen Quay of Orsay by the NSA?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Not there would be as a vague hypocrisy on your part?</seg>
		<seg id="6">The journalistic gait is not a moral positionnement, but the research of the interest and relevance of information that allow every citizen to forge itself an opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When raised WikiLeaks the sail on the analysis by the American diplomacy of political or other issues the entire world, we consider in fact that, to the look of the American power, that constitutes an important lighting.</seg>
		<seg id="8">When we describe the American systems of interception in opposition to the French diplomacy to the United States, this is not in any case to outrage us of this practice, is to describe the world such as it is.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Did France benefit from information furnished by the concerning NSA of the terrorist operations aiming our interests?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Can one to deprive oneself American collaboration?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Set it up since wholesale ten years of technological tools of interception very powerful by the United States, but also by France, officially was justified by the fight against the terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Besides, in this domain, France and the United States notably set up of the procedures of cooperation and of exchanges of almost daily information and that are described party and of other as essential.</seg>
		<seg id="13">By way of example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal zones to Miranshah was signaled to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="14">France can be driven, for example, to transmit entire pads of given ones on the region of the Sahel to the American services, and, in compensation - one the already quickly said -, the Americans can give the news to the French on of other regions of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Therefore the bottom question behind this matter NSA is not so the capacity or the right of the countries to endow itself with interception tools, that the question of the total absence of debates previous, notably within the Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be it them, and, in the last analysis, the question of the attained to liberties.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What do risk actually the United States? a degradation of their picture?</seg>
		<seg id="17">One has beautiful to denounce them, I do not see any which manner they will be able to be punished.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The risk run by the Americans can be doubles.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The first one, it is when their allies - and that was the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes to the highest summit of their State, were overseen.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States stretched themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Another effect can be him more economical: more and more of European or South American businesses grumble, to the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American contractors subjected to the American laws, and therefore to the mastery of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Last element: the vast movement of engaged revelations by media of the entire world, that contributes to set in motion a debate on the practices of supervision of the services of piece of information even then practically nonexistent, could push the legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the strengths that they gave to their piece of information services.</seg>

		<seg id="24">&quot;The portable telephones truly are a problem, not only because they eventually could create interferences with the navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could perturb the antennas relay of mobile communication if they are used on board&quot;, declared Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An industrial consultative committee created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended the last months that the government authorizes a wider usage of the personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The weighing pressure on the FAA reinforced itself during the last years to soften the restrictions concerning their usage.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Detractors such as the Clear senator McCaskill, d-mo., support that it does not exist any reason of valid security for these bans.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions are equally more and more difficult to apply for the usage of the devices became omnipresent.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Certain studies indicate that at least a third of the passengers forget to extinguish their devices, or do it deliberately.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA began limiting the usage of the electronic devices in 1996 after the reports on the interference presence with the instruments of navigation and of communication when the passengers transported radios FM, the gadget high-tech of then.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The new airplanes of line depend a lot more of the electric systems than the preceding generations of airplanes, but they are equally conceived to withstand electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airline companies allow their passengers to use the wi-fi to the cruise altitudes for a number of years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Had modified them to welcome systems wi-fi withstand equally better to interferences.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of the airplanes of line should allow a wider usage of the electronic devices by virtue of the new directives, declared Huerta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The electronic devices of today emit usually transmissions radio of power well weaker than the preceding generations of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The readers of electronic books, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when one turns a page.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Amazon.com is part of those that do pressure for a softening of the restrictions concerning the usage of the devices electronic by the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, the leaders of the corporation loaded an airplane of line of readers of electronic books Kindle and did it to fly to see if there were problems, but it not in had anything.</seg>
		<seg id="40">That inspired to the members of the consultative committee of the FAA of the ambivalent feelings as for the knowledge question if the usage of the devices presents or not a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers declared that it thought that interferences originating devices were real, even if the risk was slight.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Of other members of the committee declared that it exists only anecdotic reports emanating pilots that indicate that the devices can interfere with the systems of an airplane, and that most of between them are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA authorizes the pilots to ask the passengers to extinguish their devices during the landings to the instruments in conditions of weak visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group of the industry of the trip congratulated itself for the changes, the calling arrangements a lot of common sense for equipped travelers of technologies.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant fleeting experience is not incompatible with the security&quot;, declared Roger Dow, President and director of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="1">When I was small, Halloween was magic.</seg>
		<seg id="2">My sister and me were authorized to eat candies, to be going to put to bed us late and to disguise us to go in the neighborhood.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Today, I became stingier.</seg>
		<seg id="4">These two last years, I did not distribute a single candy and I will do it certainly not more this year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the stats show that I am the mangy ewe when one talks about Halloween.</seg>

		<seg id="13">I suppose that there is not of poorly to remain traditional.</seg>

		<seg id="15">Indeed, the Americans will spend 330 M$ in disguises for animals this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That does a lot of curious dogs disguised in hotdogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">When it is a candy matter, one not glandouille.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Americans will spend 1.9 Md$ in candies this year, according to the office Nielsen.</seg>
		<seg id="19">That represents about 272 millions of kg of bars Hershey, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and block Clark.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is a great new one for the 41 millions of children who go hunting to the candies in their neighborhood, according to the American department of the Commerce.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Indeed, we will buy and, let's not relate any histories, consume 41 millions of kg of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The candies corn are the only thing that one does not want to eat; and nevertheless almost 16 millions of kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>

		<seg id="24">It is a mystery that I did not again arrive to elucidate.</seg>

		<seg id="29">Charlie Brown presented us The Big Pumpkin when one was kids, and to sculpture a pumpkin in lantern form, is as to decorate a tree of Christmas – it is something that one does since that one is all small one.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fortunately for us, the &quot;tendency of the baby pumpkin&quot; began only last year thanks to Pinterest, therefore the most of sculptured us these potirons and did not have to sit inside.</seg>

		<seg id="2">&quot;We want that peace returns; we want stability&quot;, declared Vanessa of Sousa, general director of a corporation of investment.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Worried for the future of his country, she exchanged its work clothing against a you shirt carrying the mention &quot;we want the security&quot; in Portuguese before rejoining the stored up crowd on the place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there were practically everyday reports mentioning conflicts between the governmental forces and the Renamo, the worse clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Renamo was formerly a movement rebels famous, supported at the start by the governed Rhodésie by white then the government of apartheid of South Africa in the framework of the efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After an agreement of signed peace in 1992, she became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The analysts think that the country should not fall again in a conflict open, but the recent events shook the foreign investors and the local population.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The issue is considerable for the rapidly expanding economy since the discovery of huge reserves of gas offshore and of deposits of coal in the northwest could attract more than 50 Md$ of investments during the next years originating corporations as Rio Tinto, Is worth Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Frelimo, the in power party and the principal political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject themselves mutually the responsibility of tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Renamo declares that the government is at the origin of the recent clashes and that it launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo, October 17.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when the governmental forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempt to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the Spokesperson of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government returns the responsible Renamo to have released the conflicts, and the accused to attack soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The president Armando Guebuza tried minimize the worries concerning the instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr. Guebuza declared Wednesday to the AFP, the agency of French press, that Mr. Dhlakama considered itself as a &quot;losing&quot; that wanted to use &quot;all the forces that it remained him to attempt to prove that it could impose its decisions to the government&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Frelimo and the Renamo insist to say that they wish both of them to avoid the war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the worry grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that the Renamo abandoned the agreement of peace of 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It declared to the FT that it wanted to say that the agreement was not respected anymore by the Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;We want to resume the negotiations, but with most serious biggest&quot;, indicated Mr. Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The preceding discussions between the parties did not succeed appeasing tensions supplied by a conflict series this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;It is two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that do not stop disputing itself&quot;, explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer of the open university and specialist of the Mozambique.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them knows well to negotiate and anything of them is ready to do the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The Renamo, that is in favor of electoral reformations, already had said that she would boycott the municipal elections in front of to take place in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The presidential elections and legislatures are foreseen next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Certain commentators interpreted his usage of the force as the sick attempt of a movement to obtain from the concessions and a war treasure from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The party of the votes collected by the Renamo does not stop lowering since 1992, while a new party, the democratic Movement of the Mozambique (MDM) that was created by a former member of the Renamo, should obtain a bigger number of votes to the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – that should withdraw itself at the end of his second mandate next year – wanted to destroy the democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;It does not want any a democracy multipartite, it does not want any transparent elections, it does not want peace for it does not want to leave the presidency&quot;, declared Mr. Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">One knows not exactly which is the capacity of the Renamo, but she took attacks flashes disruptive on the commissionerships of police and the vehicles on an axis autoroutier north south major.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of clashes took place in the province of Sofala, that is situated to several hundreds of kilometers to the north of Maputo, but where is located Beira, the harbor from which the mining corporations, notably Rio Tinto and Is worth, export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio not was anymore able to use the iron way during about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the rail line.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when one asked him if the Renamo would reiterate this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The Renamo wanted &quot;to warn the international community that the things go not well to the Mozambique&quot;, indicated Mr. Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability reinforced the frustrations that gives rise to the government, declares Fernando Filed, director of Mediacoop, a corporation of independent media, many people equally being preoccupied by the corruption, the slowness of the development and the recent wave of abductions.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;The people think that the people in charge of the future of the country are the government and the president, and that this is at the latter to find solutions to the problems&quot;, it explained.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultuane, a showing one, said that the people wanted only stability.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The former editor in boss of New of the World Andy Coulson would have used &quot;telephone pirating, the supervision and the confrontation&quot; to attempt to confirm a pipe can on a liaison implying the minister of the then incumbent Interior, Charles Clarke.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared in front of the court of the Old Bailey that New of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 according to which Clarke had a relation with Hannah Pawlby, his &quot;pretty counsel special&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It was signaled to the course that the newspaper loaded Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to pirate the vocal can of Pawlby and of &quot;to plant in permanence in front of his door&quot;, but Coulson equally called it and left him vocal messages.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, that is henceforth the editor in boss of NotW, is not the kind of man to remain in front of the house of the people while hoping to surprise them, is the kind of man to like to present the history to the people to see what they say some&quot;, declared Mr. Edis.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It declared that NotW used three means to investigate on the subjects: telephone pirating, the supervision and the confrontation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The editor in boss personally is implied in the third one.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is evident that it is during the course of the second one, the supervision, it do not can in being otherwise.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But that in is it first one?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Does it have knowledge of telephone pirating?</seg>
		<seg id="10">It asserts the opposite, but we say &quot;of course that if&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The rumors on an implying liaison Clarke were resumed in first by the office of the compilation of NotW when a source, testing a sexual attirance towards Miss Pawlby, declared that one had said him: &quot;Does not lose your time with her, she is with Charles.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">A band, on which were recorded vocal messages pirated on his telephone to at least three returns, was seized to the residence of Mulcaire in August 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The investigators equally found seizures on the computer of the private detective that concerned Miss Pawlby and his orderly sisters in a file &quot;Projects&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">During the period where the detective investigated on her, the grandparents of Miss Pawlby received anonymous calls where one asked them the news on her, added Mr. Edis.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Meanwhile, the old one to put back in boss Neville Thurlbeck and the old one to put back James Weatherup supervised the supervision of the least facts and gestures of Miss Pawlby.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In a vocal message that it left him June 18 2005, Coulson said: &quot;I have a history that we foresee to publish tomorrow of which I would like really to speak with Charles.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">Mr. Edis explained that the implication of Coulson in the history followed the same outline that with of other important men, such as the former minister of the Interior David Blunkett.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett on the subject of a liaison with a married woman while frequented herself the co-défenderesse Rebekah Brooks, that was equally gotten married to this era.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Coulson and Brooks deny to have plotted with of others to pirate telephones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to have carried out telephone pirating.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The federal government maintains that the plan of salvage of 325 M$ intend for the system of unsteady health is matching strict conditions aiming to guarantee that the government of the State will not waste the funds.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The federal minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth takes currently of the &quot;urgent measures&quot; to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the insular state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The financing, foreseen on 4 years, was decided after the consultations of the government with the independent representative of Tasmanie, Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government proposed a plan of salvage of urgency that, according to us, will regulate unique difficulties to which ones the State is confronted&quot;, declared Mrs Plibersek today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The plan of 325 M$ understands a country of 31 M$ for the not urgent surgical operations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">2 600 additional operations, notably in the domain of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to recover the delay.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Funds are equally foreseen for the clinics without appointment to Hobart and Launceston, of better external cares, the formation of the medical frameworks, devoted services to mental health and the deployment of systems of electronic medical files in the local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments reply to the idea according to which, according to the clinicians of first line, it is a matter of the better means to care for the system of health of Tasmanie&quot;, declared Mrs Plibersek.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister asserted that the government of Tasmanie would be confronted to a strict system of preparation of the reports and of surrender of accounts.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The state will have to maintain the current levels of financing in order to receive money of the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A composed commission of three people will be constituted to guarantee that the State furnishes the services of the manner more effective and possible efficient.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr. Wilkie said today that the 325 M$ will not count for big thing &quot;unless they are followed by an allowing true reformation to consolidate the system of public health of Tasmanie&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It nevertheless congratulated the government to have replied to the request of urgent assistance that it presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I hope that the plan of federal assistance will big contribute to withdraw the system of public health of Tasmanie of the black list&quot;, declared Mr. Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the government of the State, these non urgent additional procedures will invert largely the recent cuttings.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the Spokesperson of the opposition regarding health Peter Dutton thinks that the today announcement is an &quot;a fortune solution&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason we are here is that the Labor government of the State withdrew 430 M$ of his system of health&quot;, it declared on ABC TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">One not can have a government of the State that pulls out almost a half billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts 300 M$, and claim that this is an auspicious day.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr. Dutton returned visits to Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar of the plan of salvage will be spent in additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Dr Georges Bwelle exempts from the free health care in the towns of Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Dr Bwelle and his past teams almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is not a lot of doctors in this country of western Africa, scarcely 1 for 5 000 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or through your movable device</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Dr Georges Bwelle is the one of the 10 Heroes CNN of the year 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him, or the one of the 10 other heroes, to elect it &quot;Hero CNN of the year&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This receive person 250 000 $ to follow his extraordinary work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father to alternate the periods of conscience and of unconciousness and go in hospitals that were not equipped for him to provide assistance.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 close to Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At first, it had only an arm broken, but it contracted an infection that propagated itself until his brain, creating a hématome of which it was going to carry the séquelles remaining it of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There was not neurosurgeons to Cameroon&quot;, declared Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have taken it abroad if we had had enough money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead of that, Dr Bwelle passed years to accompany his father in clinics and jam-packed hospitals, for that it obtains any treatment of which it could profit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;This is not easy&quot;, adds Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can leave the house to 5 o'clock, you to kick to the hospital to be the first one, and you are not the first one.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">People can die because they await too a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The position not a lot changed since the death of the father of the Dr Bwelle in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">To Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">By way of comparison, the ratio to the United States is of 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonian one could not pay the consultation.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two people on five in the country live underneath the poverty threshold, and almost three quarters of the expenditures of health of the country are realized in the private sector.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem that they have, this is poverty&quot;, explained the Dr Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And because of poverty, they cannot take advantage of life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">After seeing his father and as much of its compatriots suffering, the Dr Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of the things.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteer ones practiced more than 700 surgical acts free during last year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It became doctor himself, working as vascular surgeon to the central hospital of Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And it created a humanitarian association to non lucrative goal, ASCOVIME, that goes in the rural zones during the weekends to exempt from the free health care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, him and his group of volunteer ones helped close to 32 000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost all the Fridays, with about thirty people, they pile up in small vans after setting up medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult lands to go in the towns that have the more need of assistance.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Luck follows them not always.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They have many times must to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they are received in hero: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and their offer the better available lodgings.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these towns, the free health care are a good reason to do the party, and the Dr Bwelle – with his big one to smile and his overflowing energy – is happier to join itself to festivities.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next day morning, the team begins receiving hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We receive 500 people to every visit&quot;, declared Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They live sometimes to 60 km of the town, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In this traveling hospital, various health care are lavished.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people receive a treatment against the malaria, the tuberculosis, the malnutrition, the diabetes, the parasites and the sexually transmittable diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Of others can receive kickstands, a pair of collected glasses or a certificate of free birth – necessary document to go to the school, but many poor families not all simply step can allow themselves to buy it.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Evenings, the team practices simple surgical acts under local anesthésie.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations are usually practiced in a school, a city hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes in the awakening room to leave his place to the following person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Thanks to the lighting of the generating set, the room of operation and the sterilization of equipment, the Dr Bwelle and its volunteer ones work until the first hours on Sunday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="44">This is an exhausting rhythm, but the musicians of the towns help usually the team to remain motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They hit on drums the very night to hold us awake so that we could continue to work&quot;, explained Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sundays, the team returns in city, tired but proud of the work that she accomplished.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group, composed from Cameroonian doctors and of students in medicine, practiced 700 surgical acts free during last year, and it knows that their presence can do the very difference for those to that they provide assistance.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man explained that the free operation that it had undergone to care for a hernia would allow him to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;That will change my future and the one of my family&quot;, declared the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">What's more to make this hospital live traveling and to work as surgeon to the hospital, the Dr Bwelle works also the night in medical offices private around Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It is this second job, it explains, that finances to 60% sounds association; the remainder is covered by private gifts.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I know not when it sleeps&quot;, declared Katie O'Malley, a student in medicine in second year of the university Drexel to Philadelphia and volunteer within the group of the Dr Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="53">It always is to the hospital or in the process of trying to find money for his association in order to be able to take these countries.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For the students in medicine and them students nurses as Katie O'Malley, that come from the United States and of Europe to rejoin Mr. Bwelle in its missions, it is an apprenticeship occasion in the field that they have not at their place.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;One was able to participate in operations to help to mop up the blood or to let the instruments pass to the Dr Bwelle&quot;, explained Miss O'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">This is not something that you have the occasion to do in America when you are studying in medicine in second year.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The volunteer students pay usually travels them to the Cameroon, and arrive often with medical collected equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But once to Yaoundé, their pension, their transportation and the teaching are taken charge of by the doctor Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;This is a hero, there is not doubt&quot;, declared Katie O'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">It gives his life for this association, and his craving to help the Cameroonian people is not close to to extinguish itself.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Dr Bwelle, the load of comparatively constant work is not a difficulty.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Help the others to live happy while holding the promise that it did to his father is something that brings him an immense joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I do this work&quot;, added Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think about my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope that it sees what I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Let the people laugh and relieve the pain are the reasons that urge me to do that.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The two France of Rock Nora</seg>
		<seg id="1">Perplexed, the university a long time pained to define and to situate Rock Nora.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Professor in the amphitheaters and the course rooms?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Doubtless, but while underlining his weak one for the shortcuts, Sciences po, the High Etudes.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Referee of the works of others in his office of the street gaston-gallimard?</seg>
		<seg id="5">In fact, but in ignorant the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Did heir of the armchair that occupy Fontenelle to the French Academy?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Of course again, but while knowing that a such consecrates would not know to replace the true holy oil, the one of the thesis, of which it happened.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They gladly recognized in him a big éveilleur, coordinator and federal of their works, but while pointing out that it showed himself not very inclined to in to produce itself.</seg>
		<seg id="9">To this uncertain picture the monument of the &quot;memory Places&quot;, to which one it attached his name, also contributed.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The mean languages there were able to see a gigantic market to the fleas, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a lively blow of eye and ballasted with erudition, but incurable amateur.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The two works published by Nora here soon two years already established that the one that passed in order not to to write had a lot and well written.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The book that here him should return definitively justice.</seg>
		<seg id="13">One there rediscovers nevertheless, once more, the temptation of ubiquity, wandering intellectual, jubilation begun jumping as on foot joined of a subject to the other.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But one understands quickly that the varied objects mustered in this book to the so beautiful title bring back the bric-a-brac trader to a single one and even passion: the one to discover the constituent knot of the French identity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Why these dramatic calls to national unity?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Identity: this is an era preoccupation.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here little, we collectively were invited to some to give a definition.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders of then, the French identity was a timeless gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It was necessary only to deploy the accidents, and the matter, jacobinisme obliges, was confided in the prefects and to the under prefects, interpret authorized.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The one that stalks Rock Nora is any other.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It does not put himself in heir of an eternal francité, it refuses himself to the definition.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Worried analyst of a familiar strangeness, it wanders in a symbol forest, stopped to every step by an object in form of rébus, tormented irritating questions.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Of which this one, that is born of the business itself: why, in a so country durably installed in its borders, so formerly robust and solidly built, hears one these dramatic calls to unity?</seg>
		<seg id="24">They are not so urgent, suggests Rock Nora, that to avert the born disturbance of the discords of the French history.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Frank and Gallic, Armagnacs and Burgundian, Catholic and Protestant: the division forces, here, are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="26">And the most emblematic one is evidently the one that splits in two the national history.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As of earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, the a monarchic, the revolutionary other.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The second wanted the death of the first one, but without succeeding in deny it; concerned on the contrary of some to rediscover the sacralité and so much eagerer of unity and of indivisibility than she had cut the head to the one that some was the evident one and powerful incarnation.</seg>
		<seg id="29">And, of there, an invincible binary nation, divided between left and upright, secularity and Catholicism, adoration and hate of the revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To let this oddity of the French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexagon, so well that the American escapade of Rock Nora well being the heart of his book.</seg>
		<seg id="31">For America and France have the one and the other done a revolution, composed a declaration of the rights, wanted to be founded a corporation nine.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But the American cousinage does only more better to underline what we is clean.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Over there, men that had left their Former System in England and no longer had at about it to be concerned.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Here, men clutter with a native Former System, and so much more radical.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and the preserved one.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There founding always honored fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors of which one pains to do the models, and that are themselves killed each other remainder.</seg>
		<seg id="37">There an institutional consistency, and here a waterfall of constitutions, as as much of errors to recover and of essays to resume.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The France that leaves, the France that comes</seg>
		<seg id="39">It there nevertheless had an era where the French believed to be able to sew up the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the figure two.</seg>
		<seg id="40">To this IIIe Republic, central moment and creator, Rock Nora showed a lot of interests and even of kindness: greeting those that then employed itself to repair the revolutionary break, while teaching to the pupils all that in the former France prepared obscurely modern France and while their proposing a unified version of their history.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But this pacified identity had only a time.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The here again some debates, jostled by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the climbed protest minorities, absorbed in the European space.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The book offers therefore at once the fascinating portrait of the France that leaves and the cautious sketch of the France that comes.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With, in premium, the portrait of the historian, that should reserve some surprises.</seg>
		<seg id="45">One there discovers that the vagrant was a homebody.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The man of the multiple curiosities turned, lightly obsessional, around a same idea.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The edge prowler was anxious the center of the center.</seg>
		<seg id="48">And the one that had deposited, here more of a half century, a subject on the nation idea, but had subtracted itself to the initiatory exercise of the thesis, we confide, cum grano soil, that it will have finished by to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Of course under a less stiff form, done more burst and more subtle.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But let's not cheat there, all so constraining one.</seg>
		<seg id="51">For well more than the taxed face of the university program, said this thesis the internal necessity of a life.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Finished the passwords to type to attain his smartphone or to pay its purchases?</seg>
		<seg id="2">The American, French or Japanese researchers predict us a future where we will have recognized by the biometric sensors of the telephones and computers.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Bernard Didier, assistant general director of Morpho, estimates even that &quot;the century will be biometric&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Only biometry will allow assuring itself realizing identity of a person of the transactions in a universe also transverse and transnational as Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The dedicated organizations to the protection of private life confirm this fad for biometry, but itself in worry.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Nothing that in 2011 and in France, the national Commission of data processing and liberties authorized 774 systems of recognition of the impressions, form of the hand or network streaks hand in businesses, administrations, canteens...</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Everyone soon will be able to be identified, anywhere and does not import when&quot;, moves itself Justin Brookman, person in charge of private life of the consumers within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), to Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The such a optimism reasons, with the one, and pessimisme, with the others?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Biometry will lean on of new techniques, that will allow returning again services to the citizens and to the consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Today, in France, the biometric data the done more use are the fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the network streaks palm or fingers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But each of these techniques possesses its constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;For example, certain people that work the concrete have the very damaged fingers and their impressions are illegible&quot;, notes Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity domain with Thales Communications &amp; Security.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And the anthology as well as the verification of the network streaks and outline of the hand suppose a voluntary and precise gesture the people.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is at once a security - one not can obtain these data to their unawareness - and an inconvenience: the procedure sometimes must be repeated and takes therefore time.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Consequence, research are taken since about twenty years on of others approach, as the recognition of the face or iris (the colored party of the eye).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Thanks to the increase of the precision of the sensors and capacity of calculation of the necessary computers to the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The precision of the facial recognition was multiplied by ten during the five last years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of the laboratories of R&amp;D of Accenture in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With our assistance, the United Kingdom and Holland deployed posts borders automatic using the facial recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It is henceforth possible to identify a face or an iris in movement.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;Today, we take research on the recognition of voice or manner to walk using sonorous sensors, but it is necessary a silent environment&quot;, indicates Sridhar Iyengar, director of the research on the security to the Intel Labs.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Unique marker and infalsifiable, the DNA gives rise to equally hopes and worries.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;In the current state of the knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data&quot;, confirms Sophie vulliet-tavernier, director of the studies, innovation and forecast to the CNIL.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the analysis of the DNA is again very long and very costly.</seg>
		<seg id="24">NEC proposes to the judicial police force a costing suitcase 90,000 Euros to analyze samples of DNA on the place of a crime and in an hour.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The usages of biometry divide up themselves in two groups: the identification (to recognize a person among of others) and the authentication (to assure itself that the person is the one that she claims to be).</seg>
		<seg id="26">The identification concerned so far the delivery of papers of identity: it is necessary to confront the biometric elements (impressions, photo, iris) with the news that the State possesses on all the already put ones on file citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="27">That allows assuring itself that one no one stretched not to usurp the identity of someone of other.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This comparison principle can have other applications.</seg>
		<seg id="29">NEC proposes thus the recognition of VIP to the entry of a hotel or of a store.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;We recover the pictures of the movie cameras of supervision and the compare to the photos of the fame that freely circulate on Internet&quot;, explains Dany Nassif, loaded, with NEC France, commercial development for the solutions of biometric identification.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Other usage: to take in photo a quidam that does the tail in a store, follow his progression thanks to the facial recognition and calculate the expectation time.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The authentication concerned at the start the physical accesses (borders, local protected, canteens. ..) or logical (opening of a computer).</seg>
		<seg id="33">Itself there added, more recently, the presence check.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;A biometric timekeeper avoids the phenomenon of the buddy that not at all for another&quot;, justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But, more and more, the authentication will concern also the transactions, in particular the one realized from connected devices to Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="36">To Japan, it already is possible to withdraw money to certain distributors while introducing his card and while putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit with the secret code.</seg>
		<seg id="37">A similar technique is tested to Villeneuve-d'Ascq and to Angoulême by the corporation Natural Security in partnership with banks and signs of the big distribution: at to pay in store with his bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger in a reader that scanne the veins.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Experimentation is foreseen to last six months.</seg>
		<seg id="39">If she is conclusive, the biometric readers soon could arrive with the French merchants.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Tracks to reassure the users</seg>
		<seg id="41">It exists three manners to return enticing biometry to the eyes of the general public.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The first one is to explain that she can do to save time.</seg>
		<seg id="43">&quot;If, thanks to biometry, a customer remains in cash register thirty seconds of less, it is noticeable&quot;, explains the director of a hypermarket.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The second one is to offer personalized services: in some years, a vocal waiter will be able to recognize your voice and you to propose options on measure.</seg>
		<seg id="45">And, at last, reassure while putting forward the taken precautions to protect the data bases.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;The fingerprints are stocked on a first waiter; the identities of the people are in a second bases: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stocked in a highly reassured case, that blocks itself if one stretched to move it&quot;, enumerates Philippe Robin, of Thales.</seg>
		<seg id="47">But, for lack of deepened studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches convince really the users.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The specialists of the protection of private life, them, continue to worry.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;The progress of the facial recognition, the multiplication of the movie cameras of supervision and the huge quantity of available photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, do me to fear the worse one: a generalized supervision&quot;, predicts Andrew Patrick, Commissionership to the protection of private life to Canada.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines envisions to do to pay until 100 $ to the passengers that transport hand luggage on its flights.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines envisions to begin doing to pay until 100 $ for a hand luggage and 2 $ for a coffee or a soda, although in his announcement Wednesday, she indicated that the passengers could take the non open canette with them to the descent of the airplane.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new expenses of hand luggage concern the orderly bags in the superior compartment, therefore the small installed bags under the seat will always be free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier declared that she would do to pay 25 $ if the expenses were paid in advance and 100 $ if the travelers paid only once to the boarding door.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The spokesperson of Frontier, Kate O'Malley indicated that the 100 $ were foreseen to incite the travelers to pay the expenses in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We do not want to let this price pay&quot;, she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The airline companies began let the first one pay and second recorded luggage in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The passengers that tried to avoid these expenses put as much things as they could in the orderly hand luggage in the superior compartments, thus it did not have often more place in these compartments.</seg>
		<seg id="9">These expenses are a means to assure itself that the passengers transport less than things on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'Malley declared that these new expenses will serve not really to collect money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is a matter to do to understand to the customers of Frontier more faithful than it becomes more and more difficult to find place in the superior compartments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The passengers that buy their ticket on the site of the airline company will not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus, a passenger done the tail to a door of boarding Frontier could transport a bag free, while the following person in the tail could must pay 100 $ for a similar bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'Malley explained that the site and the procedures of recording of Frontier are changing to guarantee that the known passengers the existence of these expenses before arriving to the door.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The expenses of hand luggage of Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date was set up.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The passengers grumble often about the expenses of luggage and fresh other, but the airline companies love them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They consider that the costs of handling of the luggage are important and that the passengers that want this service should pay it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Good number of people to Wall Street consider the addition of expense of luggage as a sign that proves that the airline companies do to pay rather dear to cover the cost of the aerial trip after the loss years.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Nevertheless good number of them did not touch on the luggage expenses.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first expenses of hand luggage three years ago, and the company low-cost Allegiant followed a little later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The other only imposing company of such fresh is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, declared the consultant one with airline companies Jay Sorensen, that follows by near the expenses in supplement.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It estimated, in a report of December 2011, that the expenses of hand luggage of Spirit retrieved 50 M$ per year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former framework of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what it was going to find to the boarding door the moment the passengers would discover the expenses of unusual hand luggage taxed by the company.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;I had never seen a procedure of boarding so fluid of all my professional career&quot;, it declared.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see gratings of teeth and a scuffle to burst to the door.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The airplane was full, it added, &quot;the passengers brought up on board at the speed of light&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier done equally as Spirit and applies expenses of 2 $ for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier indicated that the passengers that take a soda or a fruit juice can take the non open canette with them, and those that take coffee can be served again free.</seg>
		<seg id="29">She will always distribute water free.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways briefly attempted to do to pay for the drinks in 2008 but went back seven months later after the passengers complained and while no other big airline company had followed.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The decision of Frontier to let expenses of hand luggage pay when the passengers buy not directly their ticket with the airline company constitutes his last effort to incite the customers to go on his site.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airline companies pay to the salesmen of online trips as Orbitz 10 $ to 25 $ for every sold ticket.</seg>
		<seg id="33">That incited all the airline companies to encourage the passengers to buy directly with them instead of to address to itself an agency of online trip.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Nevertheless, Frontier went further in this domain.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, she began to offer only the half of miles of fidelity to the customers that bought their ticket through an agency of online trip.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Wednesday, she reduced the premiums of miles of 25% on a trip.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Thus, a trip Frontier de1 000 miles bought with an agency of online trip would allow winning 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">She allows equally to the passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly their ticket on the site of Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier has a faithful clientele in his origin city, Denver, but his activity backs up and she loses money.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The recipes fell of 9% and his flight capacity diminished of almost 13% during the first quarter, according to the financial published results Wednesday by his corporation mother, Republic Airways holding Companies Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic attempted to rectify the finances of Frontier while selling the airline company.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists have just put in light the manner of which the movements of the tail of a dog are linked to his mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Of preceding studies had revealed that the happy dogs stirred more their tail towards the right (from the standpoint dog), while the nervous dogs stirred it more towards the left.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But henceforth the said scientists that the dogs can detect these subtle differences and there to reply.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientifique of the university of Thirty, declared: &quot;Everyone knows that, with the man, the left side and the straight side of the brain are implied in a different way in the stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here, we tried to see what it was some with of other types.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It added that just like with the man, with the dogs the straight side of the brain was responsible of the movement towards the left and vice poured, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For in to know more on the manner of which the dogs react to the disorderly movements of tail of other dogs, the researchers followed by the animals in the process of looking at films where figured other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the cardiac frequency of the animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It will be necessary surely not a long time before we understood why their tail goes sometimes on one hand and sometimes other.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Professor Vallortigara explained: &quot;We presented to dogs of the films where figured other dogs – is a naturalist version is an outline to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we were able trafiquer the movement of the tail and to present it as avenue to the left or to right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals saw a dog without expression to stir the tail towards the right (from the standpoint dog that stirs the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they spotted a tail to principally deviate towards the left (once more from the standpoint dog that stirs the tail), their cardiac frequency is itself accelerated and they seemed anxious.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Professor Vallortigara said that it did not think that the dogs communicated deliberately between them thanks to these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It thinks rather than the dogs know by experience the movements of which they should or do not worry.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It added: &quot;If you meet at several returns of other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail towards a side is associated with a friendlier attitude and than the straight side induces a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers indicate that the results could allow the owners, to the veterinarians and to the more better to apprehend trainers the emotions of their animals.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The expert in canine behavior John Bradshaw, invited professor to the School of the veterinary sciences of the university of Bristol, specified that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right with the canine type.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a team of the university of Lincoln discovered that the dogs turned the head towards the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and towards the right when it was a matter of a joyous dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another scientific study realized by the university of Victoria to Canada, it declared: &quot;The dogs went more easily towards a dog robot when his tail stirred towards the left rather than towards the right, instead of becoming anxious – the inverse one of what figures in the Italian study.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">It indicated that the differences could come on account of the fact that the dogs having participated in the different studies considered not completely the animals of the films or the dogs robots as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study on the manner of which the dogs react facing of true dogs could be useful, it explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;Although many elements, raised with different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used to different ends, good number of details again must be specified – and the dogs do not do exception&quot;, it declared.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nevertheless, being given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will be necessary surely not a long time before we understood why their tail budges sometimes on one hand and sometimes other.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its unities went pourchasser the rebels of the M23 even in their situated bases in the forests and the mountains of the North kivu bordering the Rwanda and Uganda.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The M23 appears on the verge of to be beaten after hunting localities of the northeast of the democratic Republic of Congo (RDC) that it checked since the beginning, 20 months ago, insurrection.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;We will follow the M23 and to corner it wherever it hides himself because it is a matter of criminals&quot;, declared to Reuters the colonel Olive Tree Hamuli, spokesperson of the FARDC.</seg>
		<seg id="4">We must not leave them to reorganize themselves because they torment the Congolese people since too a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The time had just to bring back peace.</seg>
		<seg id="6">People in charge of the M23 explained to have evacuated the localities under the diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, person in charge politics of rebellion, asserted on RFI that these military backs not would modify at all its claims to the peace talks.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The latter, according to the mediators ougandais, resumed Wednesday to Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After throwing the sponge with crash in January for the partial return of the site Goodyear of promised amiens-nord to the closing, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American pneumaticien Titan, declares itself, today, ready to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 that counts the factory.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Arnaud Montebourg, minister of productive turnaround, already had announced it, Monday October 21.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After renouncing the project of purchase of the factory in January, you return today.</seg>
		<seg id="4">You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, while talking about &quot;so-called workers&quot;, that &quot;work three hours&quot; a day, of unions &quot;crazy&quot;, while aiming the CGT.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One does not understand this about-face.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?</seg>
		<seg id="7">I do not try to please anybody.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Safe to my woman.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr. Montebourg, is a charm young man that stretched to save industrial jobs among the more better paid.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If I injured someone by my words, I am grieved some.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But France has a high level of tax and unemployment also.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Does the truth you injure?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Work seven hours a day when in of other countries one works eight hours handicaps France.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In India, in China and in a lot of other countries, one works ten at twelve o'clock a day.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But I do not have any prejudices on France.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipments, is well situated and has access to spaces to enlarge itself.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Why does Titan have so need of this factory?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Titan does not need to buy this factory.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But, with a correct price and competent workers, that is worth the blow to try.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Which type agreed do you await between the CGT and Goodyear?</seg>
		<seg id="21">If, since the announcement of the closing of the factory, Goodyear had offered to the employees a good compensation of departure, I think that 100% of the employees would have accepted it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Now, let's imagine that Titan buys to Goodyear machines it closed.</seg>
		<seg id="23">From that time, Titan could move the machines towards the Poland or about any other country of the European Union that has again his own change.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I think that Mr. Montebourg knows that.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Now, it wants to keep the factory of Amiens with at least 333 well paid jobs.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Titan accepts recruiting them among the some 1 200 current employees of Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Also Mr. Montebourg needs an engagement of Titan before trying to bring the CGT to sit to the table with Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on the departure compensation for all the employees.</seg>
		<seg id="29">From that time, there will be no longer any employees in the factory.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs during four years.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Do you confirm it?</seg>
		<seg id="32">The only number that I mentioned to the minister, this is 333.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I know that it would want a guarantee of four years.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But, as I said it for you, the CGT and Goodyear have first to come to an agreement on compensation of departure.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If all the employees the accept, the project of purchase of the factory starts up with zero employee.</seg>
		<seg id="36">How can we give guarantees of length of job when it no longer remains employees on the site?</seg>
		<seg id="37">If Mr. Montebourg succeeds in what the CGT and Goodyear come to an agreement and that Titan buys the factory, we have well the intention to remain at more than four amiens-nord years.</seg>

		<seg id="1">By a beautiful day of fine August, a helicopter of the German police flew across down with altitude the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On order of the federal Office of protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national agency of German pieces of information, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, situated to less than 5 km of the European central Bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the antenna presence of listen and that the operation gave rise to an exchange between the United States and the ministry of the German foreign Affairs to Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James To Click, the director of the American services of piece of information, insisted again in September on the Fact that the United States do not use their regarding piece of information foreign capacities for &quot;to fly the industrial secrets of the foreign businesses for the account of American corporations in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since that Edward Snowden, the consultant denunciatory become one, began unveiling his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of the supervision of the United States, the European governments and the business leaders no longer know if it is necessary to believe the director on word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports, according to which these the National Security Agency American spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to held data by American suppliers of services of storage in the Cloud, notably Google and Yahoo, more than ever gave rise to the paranoia of the businesses with regard to the supervision of State.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The revelation according to which telephones it German chancellor Angela Merkel had been pirated, maybe even for a decade, was the drop of water that did to overflow the vase.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the person more powerful of Europe can be aimed, then the leaders of business are surely also targets potentielles.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden rendered transparent the intensive collaboration between the American services of piece of information and the businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I consider that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Germany must awaken&quot;, declares Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, that represents the German SMES of the sector of the TI.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The German corporations think that the United States represent an as important risk as China when it is a matter of industrial spying and of flight of data, according to a published investigation in July by the office of counsel EY.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates to this day that the United States transmitted industrial secrets of foreign businesses to American corporations.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The politicians were part of their worry to the idea that THE E.U. does not dispose any computer capacities and sufficient Internet and think that she should strive to reduce his dependance with respect to the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The business leaders are skeptical to this subject.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A representative of the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I can only to close the eyes and to reopen them slowly...</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;This is not the good manner to do&quot;, indicates Hasso Plattner, president of the corporation of software of German business, SAP.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If one wanted an European industry of the strong TI, then it was not necessary to leave it to die 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="20">All is subsidized in Germany, coal to the cars, while going through the farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">All safe the industry of the TI.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nevertheless, extent and the sophistication of the American agencies of spying exposed by the revelations of Snowden were a shock for certain businesses that thought even while China represented the biggest risk in terms of supervision.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A big change is producing itself in the data processing in cloud since the European people in charge became aware of the Fact that the preserved data to the United States are governed by virtue of the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to an investigation realized by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organism, some 10% of the non American members renounced their projects to use an American supplier of services of storage in the cloud after the revelations on the American program of exploration of the data Prism.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Jim Snabe, co-directeur of SAP, declares: &quot;Our customers put us today a question that they put us not a year ago: where my data are preserved and you can guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many German leaders indicate that the last reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, to knowledge that the powerful states want to fly their secrets more precious and than these data have consequently to be kept to any price.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It is not surprising that there is economical spying.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It there in always had.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;This is a recurrent subject since many years and nothing not basically changed in the framework of the current discussion&quot;, declares Kurt Beer glass, general director of the productive corporation of chemical products BASF.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The Americans we spy on the commercial and industrial plan we spy them, for it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The business leaders are generally not very inclined to reveal the measures of prevention that they set up, in case that would leave the advantage to an opponent.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The big corporations hammer since a long time the message according to which it is for the less careless one to recover a key USB free at the time of a professional parlor or to leave a laptop without supervision in a hotel room.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the car manufacturer Audi, declares that the collection of the portable telephones before the meetings of the counsel, so that they cannot be used as devices of listen from afar, is a current practice since years.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The BfV of Germany counsels to its leaders to envision to use simple portable telephones prepaid at the time of their trips abroad because of the risk of attain to the integrity of the smartphones.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The portable prepaid telephones next are thrown.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for the nourish born with ambiguous sexual organs.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The masculine or feminine sex the new born ones will not attributed anymore be them, in a rigid way, to the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the framework of the new law, the parents will not held anymore be to declare the sex of their child, the authorizing to register a sex &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;not specified&quot; on his birth certificate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The goal of the law was to remove the pressure that weighed on the shoulders of the parents that could take precipitated decisions concerning a surgery of sexual réassignation for their nourrisson, and to fight against the discrimination in opposition to the intersexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the BBC, an intersexual person would have said years later, &quot;I am or a man or a woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain the patchwork that created the doctors, bruised and slashed.</seg>
		<seg id="7">One considers that a child on 2 000 born each year, is not or a boy or a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are intersexual, intersexuality being part of the group of the about sixty of diagnosed diseases as disorders of the sexual development, a generic term designating the people possessing of the chromosomes or gonads (ovaires or testicules) atypical or sexual abnormally developed organs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson could have been intersexual.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The sexual identification not yet well is not understood, but most of the specialists to the said United States that when the sex cannot be determined, it is more better to use the better available information to attribute it, then to await and follow the psychological and physical development the child before envisioning a surgical act, if need be.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Dr Jack Drescher, psychiatrist to New York and specialist of the questions of sexual identification, declared that the new German law &quot;seems to be a good idea&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The intersexual children put an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Certain people suffer from diseases extremely engrave that necessitate a surgical act, but this is not the case of most of the children&quot;, it added.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is possible to do a sexual summons without operation, and to see how the identity develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science that consists of knowledge how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one can reply to the knowledge question why that produces itself.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is as the mystery that surrounds the homosexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A report subject to the European Commission in 2011 described the intersexual people as different of the people transsexuelles or transgenres, since their statute is not linked to the sex but rather to their biological constitution, that is or exclusively the one of a man or exclusively the one of a woman, but is usually the two at the same time and not clearly defined as being the an or the other.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics can show themselves of themselves in the secondary sexual characters, (as the muscular mass, hairiness, the chest and the stature), the primary sexual characters (as the breeding organs and the sexual organs) or the structure of the chromosomes and the hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report gave equally a summary of discrimination to which were confronted the intersexual people and transgenres regarding job, as well as the extent of the acts of harassment and of violence and motivated crimes by prejudices.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The young boys of non conforming kind have henceforth camps that specially are destined them.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal already authorize the adults to register masculine, feminine sex or &quot;third sex&quot; on their official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, an Australian one of 52 years, Norrie may-welby, became the first person to the world to have been recognized &quot;neuter&quot; after winning his process in call that the authorizes to keep a sex &quot;not specified&quot; to life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersexual, according to the ministry of the Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In France neighbors, the kind questions always do the object of controversies, according to a broadcast report on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of legislators of this importantly Catholic country signed a petition for that the &quot;theory of the kinds&quot; is withdrawn school books.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The American site Catholic Online equally opposed itself to the German law, writing that &quot;since the world is led in a new reign where the kind is a choice but where the sexual activity not some is a, one reverses two other pillars of the civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">In the Maryland, the mother of a nourrisson equally declared on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex is attributed to the babies to their birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;The parent role is sufficiently upsetting without additional restrictions, in particular if you do not know the sex of your child&quot;, she declared on the site intend for the young parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The children need stability and of certainties.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, the born children without masculine sexual organs or feminine were called hermaphroditic, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god that had a double sex.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And scarcely about ten years ago, the medical community considered the kind as a slate-gray one, that one can obliterate and on which one can redessiner.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But henceforth, numerous are those that question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that the sexual identity is complex and that sometimes the doctors can be mistaken, knowing not how a child will feel his sexual réassignation when it will grow.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the middle of XXe century, one called that a psychiatric urgency&quot;, indicated Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When these children were born, one did not call the psychiatrist, one telephoned the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The dominating theory on the manner to treat the provided children of ambiguous sexual organs was launched by the Dr John Money, university johns-hopkins, that considered that the kind is malléable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It consecrated the term &quot;sexual identity&quot; and supported that the social and environmental signals – the manner of which the high parents a child – interact with the genes and the hormones of a child to fashion it so that it is identified as being masculine or sex feminine.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in a case of 1966, known under the name of &quot;John/Joan&quot;, its theories gave place to controversies.</seg>
		<seg id="39">It had counseled to the parents of a small boy of which the pénis had been cut at the time of a rushed circumcision to do it to castrate completely, while removing him equally the testicules, and to raise it as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Money presented that as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case&quot;, declared Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">At the age of about 15 years, it is returned to normalcy a boy and got married with a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But to 38 years, it committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher declared that certain doctors &quot;always repeat this model&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the years 1990, with the arrival of Internet, those that survived these operations of change of said sexes &quot;[qu '] they are not satisfied result&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a writer of 36 years of the Montana, that was born with male chromosomes XY but ambiguous sexual organs.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The doctors really could not say if it had a wide clitoris or a small pénis and were convinced that it could never have a &quot;satisfactory life&quot; as man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Therefore little time after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of the external organ and testicules and student as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One did him to take feminine hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I was not a girl&quot;, it declared on ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">To 18 years, it underwent a vaginoplastie.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But depressing and going counts that something did not go, it asked his medical file.</seg>
		<seg id="53">Which it discovered horrified it.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized to the birth – and no one had never said it for me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a disorder of the sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body to produce sufficiently testosterone for that its sexual organs can develop.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After learning the truth, it is returned to normalcy a man, while following a treatment to the testosterone and did itself to remove the breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Surgery rendered sterile it.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, it defends the cause of the others in an organization called Interface Project, that tries to normalize the perception of the intersexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne tamar-mattis, general director of the organization to non lucrative based goal in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law &quot;invites to the labeling and to the stigmatization&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists worry that the German law encourages the parents to take quick decisions and give to their child a sex&quot; indeterminate&quot;&quot;, she declared.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that she encourages the interventions.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think that it would be more better to attribute a masculine or feminine sex and await.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we did not see what the law was going to give, therefore we can only to advance hypotheses.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-mattis declared that his organization supported the Australian law for &quot;she authorizes the adults to choose to be recognized under third name sex&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;The adults should be able to take their own decisions about a legal kind&quot;, she added.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law concerns the granting of the sex to the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This is not a battle that the young children should take to this age.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they will grow, they will be able to take decisions concerning their own body.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But the Dr Arlene Baratz, specialized radiologue in the mammographies to Pittsburgh, of which the girl is suffering from a disorder of the sexual development and that helps thousands of people in a support group, declared that the German law &quot;responsabilisera&quot; the parents and the children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">The girl of the Dr Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called insensitivity syndrome completes to the androgenic ones.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because of the failure of its receivers of androgenic, Katie developed feminine characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but no uterus or of ovaires.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Today 29 years old, Katie is gotten married and internal in infantile psychiatry to the university of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children by the mediated services of adoption or of mothers carriers.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law leaves a certain latitude to the parents for that they do not have to take hasty decisions&quot;, declared Baratz.</seg>
		<seg id="76">That leaves them the time to do certain tests and to understand them, and a delay before registering &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Thus, all is well – you can raise your child and to like it.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a magnificent baby and take advantage of the pleasure to be similar.</seg>
		<seg id="79">You do not have to precipitate you for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;That puts the children to the heart of the decision and lessens the anxiety feeling that motivates the parents because they are afraid of not to do what it is necessary&quot;, she declared.</seg>
		<seg id="81">At last, the child will decide with which sex it/she feels the/the more comfortable – and this is something tremendous.</seg>
		<seg id="82">That authorizes the child to take the decision for itself.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The cry of despair of a voter of Obama</seg>
		<seg id="1">I voted two times for the president Obama, believing in the possibility of a change</seg>
		<seg id="2">It says that Obama did the praiseworthy efforts frustrated by the filibustering of the Republican Party</seg>
		<seg id="3">Filibustering does not excuse the difficulties of the site Obamacare, or the attacks of drones</seg>
		<seg id="4">The memory of the country 2008 of Obama is a sad reminder of what could have happened</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is studying in 2E medicine year to the Faculty of medicine of Harvard.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I am reading a horribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the gloom of the 2E year of medicine and would give again me hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;The Audacity à Win&quot; and it is a matter of the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I finished the medical reports of my patients evenings and that I go to bed, this book takes back me to the era where the political ones inspired millions of people and where the speeches could cut you the breath.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election finished by a victory crushing and the presenters of the current newspapers took the time to reflect to the historic nature of the moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My friends cried joy and my parents preserved all the newspapers that they found.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionary ones advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for the change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During the transition period of Obama before his taken one of function in 2008, it had 82% of favorable opinions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The return to the present is a difficult awakening, this is as go out of a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is difficult to remember these days a lot of optimism, are as of distant ones remember, a sad reminder of the timeliness of the passed.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The change really produced itself in the years that followed the first time where I voted.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I put to the credit of Obama of big realizations, since the passage of the Affordable For Act (law on the reasonable cares) to the departure of Iraq of our army, while going through the end of the &quot;or seen done or know&quot; and the assassination of Osama Bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Of more, I believe that filibustering supporter destroyed too numerous efforts aiming to let our nation advance in the domain of the reformations of the immigration, public health care and closing of Guantanamo, among others things.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after having many defended times the administration of Obama facing my peers and my colleagues, I no longer arrive to furnish explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I am by political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The republican obstruction cannot explain the placement on listens foreign leaders, or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.</seg>
		<seg id="24">She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on private life of the Americans, done or put it in accusation of the denunciatory ones that reveal the ravages of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">She cannot justify the assassination of Anwar Al awlaki, an American citizen, without process, or the escape of the public financings and the passing of the authorized expenditures during the presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media to the silence are the &quot;more aggressive... since the administration of Nixon&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="27">And, more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibility to conceive a simple site Internet during more than three years after the law on the Affordable For Act was ratified.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know if it is this to what I expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If, to 18 years, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political countries that the precede.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Evidently, the electoral function is not predictable, for the political party of opposition and the events that produce themselves by chance, as the slaughter of Newton, influence our public conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Nevertheless, all the examples that I indexed above seem be largely the choice of the administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">This is what disturbs me the more.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I have again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was filled with enthusiasm by his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney presented an alternate confused one and not very refined that did not seem to allow determining its political or its positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I felt that Obama, elected for a second mandate while being liberated pressure of future elections, would hold the promises of which one heard to speak since so a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Nevertheless, while the index of favorable opinions has dived under the 45% this week, it is even more difficult to come back to the year 2008 through this book.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It does me to desire the numerous promises that flew away themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week, I read the party of the book that describes how Obama underwent huge losses to the profit of Clinton to the Primary ones of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At the time of a meeting according to country, it said to his team that it was necessary that they put back themselves on the good way and remain faithful to their cause.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The United States sometimes went &quot;too far&quot; regarding spying, recognized the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in the middle of the debate with Europe on the massive collection of given ones by the national Agency of security (NSA).</seg>
		<seg id="2">After ten days of scandal, of revelations and of denial between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American governmental person in charge explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception by the NSA of communications and of data in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;In certain cases, I grant it to you, as did it the president, certain of these actions went too far and we will assure ourselves that that no longer arrives in the future&quot;, declared John Kerry at the time of a lecture to London to which it participated since Washington Thursday October 31 by video liaison.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In his broadcast intervention, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the boss of the American diplomacy at length justified the practices of pieces of information and of collection of information by the necessary anti-terrorist fight and the prevention against of eventual attempts.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Invoking the September 11 attempts 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and the one of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that American authorities had since frustrated many projects of attempts, thanks to the interception of communications and the information collection.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We have prevented fact that of the airplanes do not fall, that of the buildings explode and only of the people are murdered, because we were in a position to know in upstream of these projects&quot;, argued the employer of the American diplomacy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And, asserted John Kerry to the address of the Europeans, &quot;I assure you that in this process of the innocent people were not cheated&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But we strive to muster the news.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;And yes, in certain cases, this went too far in an inappropriate way&quot;, again admitted the Secretary of State, that already had to express itself on this international scandal at the time of a turn last week to Paris, London and Rome.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It assured Thursday evening that the president Obama was &quot;resolved to attempt to clarify and that it proceeded to a réexamen of these practices so that no one feels cheated&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the controversy between American and European continued to swell this week with of new revelations in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data of hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The newspaper, that quotes obtained documents with the former consultant one NSA Edward Snowden, asserts that the baptized program &quot;MUSCULAR&quot;, and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data since the fibers views used by the internet giants.</seg>
		<seg id="14">To some to believe one of the documents, some 181 millions of elements had been collected during the only months of last January - going of métadonnées on e-mail, to elements of text or audio or video documents.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These interceptions would take place outside of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Yahoo and Google denied any link with these practices.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Since ten days, several big newspapers in France, in Germany, in Spain or in Italy, revealed that the NSA massively would have intercepted data and communications emanating allies of the United States and of their leaders, notably the German chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Facing the anger of European States and while escapes in the American press asserted that the American president was not during the course of such listen, Barack Obama refused to express itself to this subject, invoking the national security.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On the other hand, the employer of the powerful NSA, the general Keith Alexander, denied him that his piece of information agency obtained tens of millions of communications of European citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It even sent back the bullet to the European services of piece of information that would have seized themselves of these communications, before to furnish them to the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="21">That would concern of the &quot;military operations&quot; in countries where these allies of NATO cooperate with the United States and that would not aim absolutely Europe, asserted the general Alexander.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And the debate spread itself Friday to Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Indonesia summoned the ambassador of Australia, of which the mission is accused to be used by the Americans in the framework of a vast network of international spying that equally gave rise to the ire of China.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Studies show that the African-American girls and Hispanics tend to attain the age of the puberty earlier that the white girls.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The physical changes do not mean that the puberty is imminent</seg>
		<seg id="3">Nothing prove that the hormones or that of other chemical substances are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">The experts think that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger of the precocious puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The tendency towards a precocious puberty also is not pronounced with the boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialized journalist in the family questions and of health with the child.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A mother she must worry if the breasts and the pubic hairs of his girl begin pushing to 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the time of the annual lecture of the American Academy of Pediatrics that was held this week to Orlando, in Florida, the Dr Paul Kaplowitz, pédo-endocrinologue, explained that these precocious physical changes are rather current among the young American one and represent a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I pass a lot of times to reassure the parents – usually, that does not indicate a quick evolution towards the full puberty&quot;, declared Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The evident signs of development, such as the burgeoning of the breasts, the hairs under the arms and in the pubic zone and the bodily odors, appear earlier with the girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there was only a light one advanced age of the first rules during the four last decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">To the United States, the average age is of 12 years and half, while it was of 12 years three quarters in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Once the chest began developing, it is necessary at least two or three years before the first rules appear&quot;, indicated Kaplowitz, equally the author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guides à Coping with This Common Problem&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The time is the test more precise for knowledge how will evolve the puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is a debate concerning which constitutes the real apparition of the puberty, but she is considered as &quot;precocious&quot; when the development of the chest is accompanied of a sudden growth before the age of 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most of the cases, the development slows down or stops itself – it is something that a paediatrician can follow by near.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A quicker evolution can justify the tests realized by an endocrinologist to separate from the problems engrave as tumors or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There exist the treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to warn other consequences: a premature ageing of the bones that can brake the growth and a small size to the adult age.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The regarding treatment medicinal and hormonal recommendations are based on the age of the child, the development rate, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The psychosocial aspects are equally important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is prudent with the medicines but recognizes that &quot;the fact to check the puberty can lessen certain problems of behavior and the sensation for the girls to be different of the others&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other big problem is understandable: The parents want all simply step only their very girls have their rules.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the manner of which they will manage the hygiene questions&quot;, declared Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;That was a shock&quot;, remembers a woman of which the girl had its first rules to 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even if there were signs and that we had talked about the rules, she was not prepared emotionally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She returned from the frightened and overturned school to be the first one among its girlfriends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Numerous there exist theories reaches to the knowledge of the public on the causes of the precocious puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Nevertheless, there is not any coherent theory according to which the contained hormones in the milk or of other foods, the present chemical products in the environment or the sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The boys, as the girls, attain their puberty earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz asserts that the hypothesis more credible is the one of the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It participated in a conducted study on girls of age 6 to 9 years that secures the percentage of fatty mass to the triggering of the puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Of discovered others support this conclusion, but there exist other numerous influential factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, the African-American girls and Hispanics tend to attain the age of the puberty earlier that the white girls.</seg>
		<seg id="34">It exists various explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">To the world-wide ladder, the mechanisms of the precocious puberty seem to be influenced by all, economical conditions to the climate, while going through the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Other problem: Although the boys have hairs on the face and in the pubic zone younger, the tendency towards a true precocious puberty also is not pronounced as with the girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Of other doctors participating in the lecture of the AAP insisted on the complexity of the subject.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of the acne and pubic hairs is current, even with the nourish and the all small ones.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We must be prudent as for the manner of which identify ourselves the true one appearance of the puberty&quot;, said the Dr Lawrence Silverman, a working pédo-endocrinologue to the hospital for children Goryeb to Morristown, in the New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The parents should not hesitate to ask counsel to their paediatrician for knowledge how to speak with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;That can want to say to have a conversation earlier that foreseen&quot;, explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you remain calm, your child will react well usually.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The girls of which the puberty is precocious must be reassured on the Fact that, even when that arrives earlier that foreseen, the process is part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Retired since 2008, it participated in 2004 to the creation of the association of defense of the hostages &quot;Hostages of the world&quot;, that it presides for a number of years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">His principal objective: to obtain the possibility for the hostages to carry complaint and to bring their takers of hostages in front of the international penal Course.</seg>
		<seg id="4">More than 1 held 000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al qaida to the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Rock Legrand and Marc Féret were liberated Tuesday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">After the medical examinations to the military hospital of the Val-de-Grâce Wednesday afternoon, they were able, since, rediscover their families.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And attempt, little by little, to resume the course of their life.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;The New Observer&quot; questioned John louis Normandin, 62 years, big former to put back, retired since 2008, president of the association &quot;Hostages of the world&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As early as evenings of your liberation, you were on the plateau of the 20H of&quot; Antenna 2&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Which are today your memories of your liberation?</seg>
		<seg id="10">On the spot notably, to Beirut.</seg>
		<seg id="11">When I am liberated, I meet again in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it for it does black - Roger Auque.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It says me &quot;one is liberated&quot;, but I not some am sure, and is said me that one again can be killed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">One is very excited, but very stretched also.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is the war, and those that drive us are them also very stretched.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They deposit us on the edge of a sidewalk.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are Syrian military officers.</seg>
		<seg id="17">One arrives next on the site of the hotel Summerland where the press is present.</seg>
		<seg id="18">French bring us to the embassy of France.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This is the time of the first phonees calls to the parents, to the family, to the friends, to the press...</seg>
		<seg id="20">I remember to have taken a bath for an hour.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And to have dined in t shirt to the embassy of France.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I remember also of a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Tension always is there for we do not have any means to evacuate ourselves towards the airport of Larnaca to Cyprus.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Arrived over there in helicopter, one takes one to have deprived that brings back us in France through Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How did unfold itself your arrival on the French ground?</seg>
		<seg id="26">One lands to Orly.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This is a not very brutal.</seg>
		<seg id="29">There is an unbelievable crush.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And a lot of media.</seg>
		<seg id="31">When I left there were three chains of television.</seg>
		<seg id="32">I return and there are some full.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The descent of the stairway of the airplane, the reunions with my son and my parents, my friends, all that is extremely strong in emotion.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Between the airport and at my place, many bikes follow our car that drive Roussin.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The motorcyclists pull themselves the stuffs to do the photos and follow me until at my place where I must do a little the police to prevent certain climb.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The media pressure is huge.</seg>
		<seg id="37">That does not stop, we well placed to know it...</seg>
		<seg id="38">But the state of emotion and of fatigue is such as it is difficult with there to see clear.</seg>
		<seg id="39">One goes out of a hole and one is all of a sudden under the media fires.</seg>
		<seg id="40">This a little is complicated, a not very violent, rather complex one to manage.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But one did the hardest one.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Evenings same, I am at the 20H, the next day also I am at the TV.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Begin next a sort of readaptation to life, very gently, during an or two months that are a little as vacation.</seg>
		<seg id="44">How did happen the medical examinations and the debriefing DGSE?</seg>
		<seg id="45">I had had right to a first medical check in Corsican.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The remainder was done to the Val-de-Grâce the days following my return: radios, examinations in all kinds and meets with a psychiatrist.</seg>
		<seg id="47">This is not a meeting that does all but one knows that one can count on him, to recall it if need, that one is not delivered to ourselves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">That is part of the procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="49">I also met the piece of information services.</seg>
		<seg id="50">They asked me questions on the takers of hostages.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It was logical.</seg>
		<seg id="52">That did not bother me.</seg>
		<seg id="53">How do you react, today, to the liberation of the four hostages of Niger?</seg>
		<seg id="54">I listen what is said.</seg>
		<seg id="55">The debate on the ransoms notably.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Certain things irritate me, of others less.</seg>
		<seg id="57">I try to do the party of the things between the questions on my passed as hostage and my cap of president of the association &quot;Hostages of the world&quot; that allows me to put distance, and seems me well more interesting to approach.</seg>
		<seg id="58">I wonder for example on the definition of the resiliency.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Especially, I fight, with of others, for the recognition of the lawful statute of the hostage.</seg>
		<seg id="60">There is according to me a problem of semantic one.</seg>
		<seg id="61">It is necessary to qualify the taken hostages of take of hostages &quot;political&quot; - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to carry complaint and to bring their takers of hostages in front of the international penal Course.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Today, once more, everyone is in compassion, in the emotion, and rejoices at the liberation of these hostages.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But that says that these hostages maybe could have them also access to justice?</seg>
		<seg id="64">A court to The Hague is done for that.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Why would not say one to the takers of hostages &quot;you scorned the rules of the war, as the one of all the Geneva conventions, one will bring you in justice&quot;?</seg>
		<seg id="66">That seems me nevertheless founded, legitimate, hit with the common sense.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This message is heard, but not listened, and that is shocked me.</seg>
		<seg id="68">This is my principal fight.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: The explosion of Europe gives the choice to the Scots</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another disturbing history of independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, one warns us that an independent Scotland would be held to rejoin the European zone of free circulation to be able to adhere to THE E.U.</seg>
		<seg id="3">And here that one hears histories of check of the passports to Berwick and of a border of barbed sons alongside the wall of Hadrien.</seg>
		<seg id="4">If it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde indicated the eventual fallen again one economical of a bigger liberty of circulation with the remainder of Europe, that did not figure nevertheless in the headlines (and it was to foresee).</seg>
		<seg id="5">Not person did more say only the States members of THE E.U. consecrate a big party of their time to bypass their definite rules when that arranges them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Since not done left Scotland of the space Schengen for the moment, a continuous non-respect of the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in compensation of all that she wants to obtain from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a matter therefore of a history that not some is a.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And a so old history that she now is immobilized: I heard for the first time the fib according to which &quot;the independence means the check of the passports&quot; more than 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nevertheless, one forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty story.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why the yoke of London to exchange against the one of Brussels, in particular now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here the true concerning current event Europe: the big plan according to aiming war to unify Europe is definitively to the dead point.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the crisis of the Euro, the Project Europe is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Through Europe, the parties that oppose themselves to THE E.U. or that campaign for the abandonment of the Euro as common motto, win land.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Alternate euro-skeptic party for Germany, been founded only this year and arrived from no one leaves, mustered almost five millions of voices at the time of the federal elections of September and has gone out the liberal Party democrat (equivalent of our liberal democrats) Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It there always had a national opposition to the project of creation of a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the current economical crisis marked a turn.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity taxed by Berlin and the European central Bank, associated with weighing rigidity on the economies national by the intermediary one adhesion to the uniform currency, drove many people to think that the Project Europe went too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the Euro does not have big thing to see with the national governments that record excessive budget deficits – that was only true for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The European system rather did to weigh on its members of the rates of change in favor of the exporting Germans – which the German politicians want to preserve.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national motto, the countries of Europe of the south meet again with a problem of intrinsic productivity with respect to Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only recourse is to do the dark cuttings in the salaries and the public expenditures – encouraged by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Beyond the budget and current monetary problems it exists a deeper malaise linked to the productivity in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">After the political energetic one &quot;green&quot; taxed by Brussels – that are a reason to subsidize the French and German corporations of the sector of the energy to the expenses of the consumer – the European industry pays two times more for the electricity and four times more for the gas than the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It is a matter of an inconvenience rédhibitoire in terms of costs, as we already saw it to Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All the freezes of salaries to the world will not prevent the industry pétrochimique European to be penalized by a shale inexpensive American gas.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Consequently, the revolt scolds, in particular in France, the one of the big leaders of THE E.U.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite considered THE E.U. as a means to check Germany and to put Paris on an equality foot with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin no longer has need of Paris as passport of his political legitimacy and imposed his own economical politics in Europe, leaving the French economy put to poorly to struggle itself.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result: the party of extreme right of Navy The Pen, the anti-european National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending back the socialists in power at the third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The National Front henceforth left it the most popular one in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labor Party that recalls him than it cannot leave the principle than a split of the right will favor automatically the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What does Marine The Pen with his new popularity with the class worker French white?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the European elections of next year to create a unique anti-change pad and anti-european within the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the anti-european parties do good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a pad could check the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here which I think: very soon, the anti-european feeling and unique anti-change in Europe will unify itself and will end up to kill the Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">THE E.U. will not disappear, but she will come back to something that will resemble more to &quot;Europe of the Nations (sovereign)&quot; free privileged by the General of Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and someone of its economies satellites could preserve the Euro, but France and Europe of the rediscover souths their own motto.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that the United Kingdom takes its distances in comparison with this project, and I hope that it will do the soft eyes to the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington for the Pacific leaves to think that the Great Britain will be left for account in the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">And Scotland, in all that?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can decide to be a region of the small England (essentially).</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economical interests, which includes to send to take a walk Berlin and Brussels.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I believe that Scotland could suit itself of an European agreement freer provided that we kept our own motto.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The cooperation with the other countries to the similar views would be easier in an Europe of the non federal Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should imitate the Norway and preserve our economical independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The government SNP of Scotland is – and it is to be noted – the anti-austerity political movement that it more better succeeded in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 base on his opposition to the dark proposed cuttings (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labor chessboard, Alistair Darling, and the conservative coalitions/liberal-democrats that followed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous now for the Scotland to vote for the independence if this is to accept the austerity taxed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black can in your car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">While the planificateurs of the road network of the United States have trouble to find necessary money to repair infrastructure autoroutière in decrepitude, numerous are those that glimpse a solution in the form of an a small black can that sets up itself above the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, that record all the miles traversed by a motorist and transmit the news to the officials, are at the controversial center of an attempt to Washington and in the governmental offices of the planning to modify the obsolete system of financing of the principal American roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The sector generally without interest of the planning of the main roads has sudden provoked a strong animated debate and eventful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The libertarians rejoined groups ecologists to do pressure so that the government uses the small cans to keep the track of the miles that you traverse, and eventually road on which circulate you, then to use the news to compose a project of fiscal law.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Tea Party is horrified.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Civil American Liberties Union is she also very preoccupied and expresss his worry concerning the protection of private life.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And while the members of the Congress do not arrive to come to an agreement for knowledge if it is necessary to continue, several States did not await.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They look for how, during the next decade, they will be able to pass to an allowing system to the drivers to pay according to the number of traversed miles.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists already embarked these black cans, sometimes equipped of a system of supervision by GPS, for a turned experimental one.</seg>
		<seg id="10">That is really essential for our nation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;This is not as if we had the choice&quot;, declared Hasan Ikhrata, general director of the Southern California Association of Governments, that foresees that the State begins recording the miles traversed by every Californian motorist of here 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be change in the manner of which pay us these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The pressure comes on account of the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, financed with the taxes that the Americans pay to the pump, is financially to dry.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Americans no longer buy as much of gasoline than before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The cars can traverse more miles with a gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax itself, that is of 18.4 hundred a gallon, did not increase for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even of 1 hundred, while the prices of the gasoline students.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The tax on the gasoline is not all simply step tenable&quot;, declared The Munnich, a specialist of politics of transportations to the university of the Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His State recently did to install traceurs on 500 cars to test a payment system to the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;That proves itself to be the alternate one the more logic in the long term&quot;, it said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Wonks calls that of the expenses of usage to the mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is not surprising that the idea seduces the liberal city-dwellers, since the taxes could serve to modify the driving habits so as to allow reducing the obstructions and the gas transmissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The planificateurs of California are very interested in the system since they elaborate strategies to attain the fixed objectives in the ambitious laws of the State on the climatic warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), president of the Committee of the transportations of the House of Representatives, declared that it considered it also as the alternate one the more viable in the long term.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The favoring market free one foundation Reason appreciate equally the idea to let the drivers pay to the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;It is not a matter not simply of a tax rushing in a big black hole&quot;, declared Adrian Moore, vice president of the political one to foundation Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The people pay more directly for the advantages that are obtained them.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is equally supported by two American former secretaries to the Transportations that, in a report of 2011, urged the Congress to go in the way of the payment to the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The American Senate approved a project pilots of 90 M$ last year that would have concerned about 10 000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the presidency of the Room killed the suggestion, replying to the preoccupations of the rural legislators representing voters that must traverse many miles everyday to go to their work or in city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several States and big cities do nevertheless of the progress of their side.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The done more determine is the Oregon, that mobilized 5 000 drivers to take the experience more important of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These motorists will pay soon to the State of the fresh kilométriques instead of the taxes on the gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The Nevada already took to term a project pilots.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The city of New York in envisions one.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The stretched Illinois an essay on a limited number of trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the coalition I-95, that understands 17 implied agencies in the road transportation in States following the coast is American (understanding the Maryland, the Pennsylvania, the Virginia and the Florida) student how she could implement the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal success.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In the Nevada, where about 50 voluntary motorists recently equipped their car of a device, the drivers were worried that the government can follow their least facts and gestures.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;The worries on the subject of Big Brother and this thing kind are a big problem&quot;, declared Alauddin Khan, that directs the strategic management of the performance to the department of the Transportations of the Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">This is not something that the people want.</seg>
		<seg id="43">As early as the beginning of the essay, the ACLU of the Nevada warned on his site: &quot;This would be comparatively easy to transform these devices in location devices to entire party.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is not necessary to construct a huge technological infrastructure and cluttering that inevitably will be widened to preserve the recordings of the avenues and daily comings of the people.</seg>
		<seg id="45">The Nevada is part of the some States that struggle themselves henceforth to find a reasonable technology that would allow the knowledge State how much miles traverses a car, but without knowing the place or the exact hours.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If one can do that, added Khan, the citizens will be more comfortable.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The research of this technology brought certain agencies of State to call upon a small start-up of California of the name of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">To the origin, the corporation did not destine itself to help the motorists that pay taxes to the States.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She tried to pierce in the emerging market of the car assurance, in which the drivers would pay according to their mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices that she tests pleased the planificateurs of the main roads for they do not use the GPS and furnish a limited quantity of information, downloaded periodically by modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;The people will be more inclined to do that if you do not record their speed and do not localize them&quot;, declared Ryan Morrison, general director of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Of big errors were committed in the programs pilot certain States.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There exist the well means less costly and well methods less intrusive to proceed.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In the Oregon, the planificateurs attempt the experience while offering to the different motorists choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">They again can choose of not to have device of the all, preferring to the place to pay a based fixed price on the average number of miles traversed by all the residents of the State.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Of other States hope to sell the concept to distrusting citizens while allowing the devices of some to do more, rather than not enough.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In the city of New York, the people in charge of the transportations try develop a taxation device that would equally be equipped to pay the parking expenses, to furnish an assurance &quot;payment to driving&quot; and to create a data body on the speed in real time in origin of the conducting others that the motorists could use to avoid the traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;The motorists would be incited to participate because of the advantages that the system offers them&quot;, indicated a document on the urban installation.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Nevertheless, certain planificateurs of the transportations wonder if the whole debate on the payment to the mile is not simply a huge diversion.</seg>
		<seg id="61">To the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the zone of the bay of San Francisco, the said people in charge that the Congress very simply could manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund while increasing the taxes on the gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="62">A unique or additional annual tax on the vehicle drivers cross and on of others of which the vehicles do not consume a lot of gasolines, so that each pay his just one leaves.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;It is not necessary to resort to to a radical surgery when one has all simply need of aspirin&quot;, declared Randy Rentschler, the director of the legislation and public matters with the commission.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If one does that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about the private protection of their life and of a pile of something else.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A British contractor created the first fluorescent ice to the world to jellyfish basis.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent property of this sea animal to develop a luminescent light meal.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It in had the idea after reading a study on the jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate chemically the brilliant protein.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The frozen cream reacts with the language while increasing the pH of the protein to do it to shine.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Chris explains that, since the frozen cream begins shining when she reacts to the heat of the mouth, more one licks, more she becomes brilliant.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Charlie, the founder of the corporation of ices &quot;Lick Me I'm Delicious&quot;, declared: &quot;This is something unbelievable but we are some again only to the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200£.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The protein that we use in the ice reacts with the language to neuter pH.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Therefore when your mouth reheats the protein, the level of pH increases and the ice begins shining.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We have it tested during the last months and it seemed timely to divide it with all at Halloween for she gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This is probably the ice more dear than I created for the luminescence of the jellyfish is worth four dearer time than gold.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Edward Snowden, the denunciatory one of the services of American pieces of information, declared that it was disposed to go to Berlin to testify in front of the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and his director Keith Alexander did not furnish responses on their activities.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The German representative Hans christian Ströbele met Thursday Mr. Snowden in Russia, where it benefits from the refuge right, to discuss his testimony in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In a letter that the representative presented to the media to Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: &quot;Although the result of my efforts was quite obviously positive, my government continues to treat the opinion difference as an escape and tries penalize the political speech with accusations against which ones it is impossible to defend itself.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Nevertheless, say the truth is not a crime.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that it thought that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the penal loads withheld against him.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the framework of the complaint deposited by the American ministry of justice, it is accused spying and of flight of goods of the State.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hans peter Friedrich, minister of the German Interior, declared to the Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with the German people in charge, we will do in goes out to return that possible.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">The relations between the United States and Germany were put to rough test following complaints according to which ones the NSA had put on listens the portable telephone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thomas Oppermann, the representative that directs the parliamentary group supervising the secret services foreigners, indicated that if it there had a chance to hear Mr. Snowden by way of witness &quot;without endangering it and completely to ruin the relations with the United States&quot;, it was necessary to profit from it.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr. Ströbele, German Green representative, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his account Twitter.</seg>
		<seg id="11">At the time of his visit in Russia, it was accompanied of two German journalists.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr. Ströbele declared that, according to the lawyer of the old consultant one NSA, Mr. Snowden could not return in Russia if it left the country.</seg>
		<seg id="13">If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, it would be necessary to give him the assurance that it would be in &quot;security&quot; over there, declared the representative.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that it had been the object of a persecution country &quot;engraves and sustained&quot; that had forced it to leave his country.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Nevertheless, it said that it had been encouraged by the world-wide reaction facing &quot;my act of political expression&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The citizens of the entire world as well as the high representatives – including to the United States – judged that the inexplicable revelation of a system of permanent supervision was public usefulness.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A team of biologists directed by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new type of heir apparent to bump to the wide one northern coasts of Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Thibaut Bouveroux, loaded with scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and the Etude of the Animals and Sea Environments (OCEAMM) returns for THE Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new types.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Does the discovery of this new type of heir apparent to bump you astonish?</seg>
		<seg id="3">This is a good new one, but that astonishes me not particularly.</seg>
		<seg id="4">If by the passed, the types were described and identified on basis morphologique, anatomical and geographic, today, the development of new tools such as the genetic one allow us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of the types.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It is not besides impossible that these progress in genetic and in molecular biology question the classification or the membership of a type to a kind, a family, indeed even an order.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At first 19th century, the morphologistes classified the animals, on the basis of the differences morphologiques between the types.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today, certain of these classifications are questioned because of the progress of the genetic one.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Same manner, two types very close morphologiquement were distinguished thanks to the genetic one.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is the case of the new type that has just been identified.</seg>
		<seg id="10">About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two types belonging to this under family: the heirs apparent to bump of the Pacific and the whales to bump of the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The recent analyses allowed distinguishing four types.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Why is it a question of an importance discovery as asserted it the Wildlife Conservation Society?</seg>
		<seg id="13">From the standpoint conservation, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the type and therefore his genetic variability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">If this population already was known since a long time by the researchers, they did not know that she was part of a new type, presents only to this place.</seg>
		<seg id="15">From that time, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or of accidental capture puts itself in the region, we could have to deal with the extinction of a type, rather than to a local disappearance of a population of a type more more more widely more shed on Earth.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This gene pool loss would be a lot more problematic one.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A type is considered threatened or in the process of extinction according to the number of existing individuals on Earth, that is to say stock, and possibility that she has to reestablish itself from the stocks neighbors.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With regards to the type Sousa chinensis, of which the population of the new discovered type is originating from, his stock automatically became weaker, the return thus more vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Why is it rare to discover new types of sea mammals?</seg>
		<seg id="20">The sea mammals are situated at the top of the food chain.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They live in homogenous habitats, opened, in which these there are many genetic exchanges between the populations and the individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This intermingling of genes limit the creation of new types.</seg>
		<seg id="23">On the other hand, the more closed ecosystems favor the genetic isolation, that can generate to term the creation of new types.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is necessary to know that the sea environment is the environment the less known good.</seg>
		<seg id="25">One prefers to send robots on March, that of knowledge which lives in the pit of the Mariannes, to only 11 kilometers of the surface of the sea.</seg>
		<seg id="26">One spends more money in the life research on the other planets than in the marine research and it is big time than that changes.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Bomber Inc, aeronautical and Canadian rail builder signaled a fall of 15% of his net profit Thursday, under the pressure of a decrease of the orders and deliveries of airplanes during the third quarter and of contractual problems in his division Trains.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bomber, based to Montreal, not not did more furnish data of essay in flight for his very new airplane CSeries or of information allowing knowledge if the airplane will respect his ambitious calendar of put one in commercial service before next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the inaugural flight of the airplane of essay there is about a months and half, the latter flew only three times, and the question then put itself knowledge if the essay phase was in good way.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results were not at the height of the anticipations and the current of the actions backed up of 8% to the stock Market of Toronto.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, analyst within the National Bank Financial, lowered Thursday his notation, passing of &quot;surperformance&quot; to &quot;sector performance&quot; because of the weak potential one of raises stock market during the next quarter or of the two next quarters.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Although the decrease of the deliveries of airplanes was largely early, we really disappointed by the profitable margin in the division Transportation&quot;, declared Cameron Doerksen in a grade to the customers.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We think that Bomber will record new orders for its airplanes CSeries while the essay program in flight will advance.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Nevertheless, if no new order is announced during the course of the next months, we expect that the market becomes more skeptical on the subject of the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bomber hopes that the family of airplanes CSeries will be able to catapult it in the inferior segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first airplane of essay was unveiled in March and flew away itself for the first time in September after the delay months.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the number of orders close for the airplanes CSeries is modest so far to height of 177. It seems that the potential buyers await the results of the essays in flight to validate the affirmations of the corporation concerning energetic effectiveness and the potential one of economies of the new airplane of line.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At the present time, the corporation recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase engagements with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Rock Beaudoin, president and boss of the direction, is convinced that Bomber will attain his objective of 300 orders close before the placement in commercial service of the first airplane.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The leaders equally reassured the analysts and the media Thursday while their indicating that the program advanced in accordance with the calendar.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The essay airplane did not remain at the ground a long time than foreseen&quot;, declared Mr. Beaudoin at the time of a telephone lecture, adding that the essays to the ground and updated them logicielles were foreseen during the time of stop of the airplane.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Every builder plans in a manner different.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We had decided to proceed to a first flight and to foresee a period of updated, and this we did.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That will reproduce itself throughout the flight program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second one of the five airplanes of essay should fly away itself in the weeks to come, the others will follow little time after, indicated the corporation.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Nevertheless, the analysts are skeptical as for the Fact that the first customer can do to fly an airplane CSeries only 12 months after his inaugural flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bomber indicated that she was evaluating the entry calendar in service and will furnish new information during the next months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slowness of the essays in flight – although she is apparently in accordance with the internal calendar of Bomber – reinforces our opinion according to which the entry in service will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015&quot;, declared Mr. Doerksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">To the third closed quarter September 30, the net profit of Bomber fell to 147 M$, or 8 hundred by action, in comparison with 172 M$, or 9 hundred by action, a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The result by tailored action remained unchanged to 9 hundred.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Income lightly backed up of 4.2 to 4.1 Md$.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The analysts expected a result of 10 hundred by action and income of 4.56 Md$, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth aeronautical builder to the world indicated that it had delivered 45 airplanes during the quarter, against 57 a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The net orders fell to 26 airplanes, against 83 beforehand.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The delay in the Aeronautical division represented 32.9 Md$ to September 30, unchanged figure in comparison with December 31 of the preceding year.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In Aeronautics, the results were in accordance with our anticipations, but the weak number of orders and the general conditions of the market were disappointing&quot;, declared Mr. Beaudoin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The income of the Aeronautics lowered of 13% to attain 2 Md$.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bomber, the biggest rail builder to the world, declared that the income of this division had increased closely of 11% to 2.1 Md$.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The notebook of orders of the division Transportation totaled 32.6 Md$ to September 30, is a light increase in comparison with December 31 of the preceding year.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The margins of the division Transportation suffered from the problems of execution concerning some big contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The leaders announced that of new indications would be furnished during the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The course of the actions of Bomber, that equally announced that Patrick Pichette, boss of the financial direction of Google Inc, would sit to the board of directors, fell of 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Brazilian corporation Embraer HIS, third aeronautical builder to the world and competitor more close of Bomber, indicated Thursday a decrease of 10% of his quarterly profit.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Five years ago already that my father obliterated himself world of the living ones.</seg>
		<seg id="1">At first I denied his death, I talked about him to the present,</seg>
		<seg id="2">I had so fear to forget it or rather I knew not how I was going to continue to the &quot;to frequent&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It does not exist any recipe, of method of job to pass the wall of the invisible one and to rediscover his.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Then signs appeared.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The first time this was the very felt fort of his presence on the fleeting seat while I drove.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another time, a soft awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that does not leave me more, borne on the night table.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is the smiling picture of my father who accompanies me in my gestures to the Newspaper.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Our mother left us after his exhausting fight against the cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is less what I thought the day where I found his body empties, made tense on this hospital bed to the crumpled sheet.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All the same, its funeral were an icy farewell focused around the lean glimmer of the candles that framed his coffin.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I thought that she had left.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Little by little, by small daytime or night apparitions, a not very shy, a little obliterated, she quickly returned in my spirit, evolving while she resumed his place in the landscape of my thought that believed itself in mourning.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And then, she revealed herself while unveiling me my own facets that I again had not perceived, masked by my relation with her.</seg>
		<seg id="14">I have therefore learn and understand that I not in the least had lost the person of my mother but simply a woman that I knew not really, a woman that embodied this person, during his stay in life.</seg>
		<seg id="15">While dying, this woman had perfect his life and liberated the person that I liked, and here that I rediscovered it, full and entire.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This detour of the way of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful one.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is a knowledge privilege that the liked people never leave us.</seg>
		<seg id="18">I resemble my father, &quot;to the inside as to the outside&quot; it adorned.</seg>
		<seg id="19">One always said it for me.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I never believed it the era.</seg>
		<seg id="21">I had difficult relations with him until it becomes old, sick.</seg>
		<seg id="22">There, I not was afraid anymore of him and I was able to like it.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A day, it is dead.</seg>
		<seg id="24">During a long time, it accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I had poorly...</seg>

		<seg id="38">Sometimes, certain dreams carry me on the contrary and are in line with themselves my history and effectively, they continue to live and to divide my life.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The day before of my échographie where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I awakened, I hoisted myself outside the bed, my father awaited me on the bearing and it smiled me and rejoiced that I await a small boy.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The next day, I felt that it had returned me visits in my sleep to mean me that it divided with joy which arrived me.</seg>
		<seg id="41">And of course, this was a small boy in my stomach.</seg>
		<seg id="42">I liked to divide this moment with him and I take pleasure to relate this common memory lived after his death.</seg>

		<seg id="47">But she continues to influence my life, notably in the moments where I am located in difficulty, or well when I must take important decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Learn the Arab and to be very interested in me the Middle East, to the point of some do a master in a big school, were not, with the decline, harmless choices.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Indeed, I heard it often to speak Arabic in my childhood, and to talk about Morocco, there where she had lived during decades - before regaining the France at the independence.</seg>
		<seg id="50">The values that she inculcated me always are present, so well that it arrives me to think about how she would want that I act to a given moment.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It leaves of even for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of generosity and integrity of spirit of the one that was a fervent believing one.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Henceforth, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="53">I see its eyes to bear on themselves me.</seg>
		<seg id="54">My mother deceased nineteen years ago now.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Dead after talking on the phone me.</seg>
		<seg id="56">I am gone through all the phases: lack of understanding, anger, the pain, the pleurs that release themselves only, anywhere, does not import when, in unusual places, out-of-place moments.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Then, the time appeased the penalty.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Remained only the lack, this emptiness without response, this need of her, to entrust me, to reassure me to the hollow one of his softness.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Nevertheless, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Every morning, I see its worried eyes to bear on themselves me, I see the rings that weigh down his look, the ridules around the lips that dig the cigarettes, the pleats that mark the forehead the days of worry.</seg>
		<seg id="61">My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.</seg>
		<seg id="62">And every morning, I divert the eyes.</seg>
		<seg id="63">My woman and the mother of my 3 children deceased of a cancer to 43 years.</seg>
		<seg id="64">One feels in permanence his protection, nothing of engrave not we can arrive.</seg>
		<seg id="65">It was his promise on his pain bed, then one has little by little learn again to smile, and to pronounce his name no longer is taboo but a consolation.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Well on, I speak him in the hollow one night when the absence done too poorly, she invites herself in my dreams when the morale a little is attained.</seg>
		<seg id="67">We feel carried and protected in the difficult moments, the decline of the time does us to realize how much she was boss of orchestra and we try to remain in the way that she had traced ourselves.</seg>
		<seg id="68">If a being liked you very strong, the absence cannot pull out it for you heart and memories.</seg>
		<seg id="69">In a way, to be liked it becomes your internal energy.</seg>
		<seg id="70">I lost my father August 22 2008 of the continuations of a cancer of asbestos.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohamed Morsi lent the nomination oath, but it is not very probable that his day of triumph marks the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when it lent the nomination oath to the presidency, becoming thus the first freely elected and succeeding president to Hosni Moubarak that was hunted strength 16 months earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At the time of his nomination in front of the High constitutional course, Mr. Morsi equally became the first Islamist freely elected president of the Arabic world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It lent oath in front of the 18 judges in black dress of the Course of which the situated building in edge of the Nil was constructed to resemble an Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We inhale to better consequences, a new Egypt and a second republic&quot;, declared the president Morsi during the solemn live broadcast ceremony on the public television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people put the foundations of a new life – absolute liberty, a true democracy and stability&quot;, explained Mr. Morsi, an engineer of 60 years formed to the United States, coming from the Moslem Brothers, a group fondamentaliste considered during more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by the successive governments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local hour, followed by a small convoy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only some hundreds of supporters had mustered themselves in front of the Course to acclaim the new president and, distancing itself of the auspicious presidential one years Moubarak, the circulation was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the very frequented streets linking up the center city to the suburbs south.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Considered as the &quot;spare tire&quot; not very charismatic Moslem Brothers, his personal prestige considerably reinforced itself since his victory and his speech of Friday to the course of which it tried to present itself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those that want to finish the started work at the time of the uprising of 2011 against the authoritarian president Moubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern State&quot;, declared Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing to itself the present judges in the decorated room of woodwork where it lent oath.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The dispute done fumes between the big aeronautical builders about the width of the seats of the economy class on the long flights mails, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the time of the aeronautical parlor of Dubaï that takes place months here.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The conflict concerns the width of the proposed seats on the long flights mails to the passengers of the economical class – that not always the are more wooed by the airline companies, but to which ones spaces it allocated is essential to increase the effectiveness gains in the last devices presented by Airbus HIS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This week, Airbus called the aeronautical industry to set up an imposing norm a size of seat of at least 18 thumbs (45,72 cm) in the economical classes, but his big American rival Boeing declares that this should be at the airline companies to decide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The disagreement has burst while the avionneurs try sell versions even bigger of their long airplanes twin-engined mails, while hoping eventually a record of orders at the time of the event that will unfold itself of the 17 to November 21.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The manner of which the seats will be disposed at the back airplane – in particular, there it will have 9 or 10 seats of forehead – is essential for the economical yield of the segment of the &quot;mini-jumbo&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing declares that his &quot;777X&quot; réaménagé will be able to welcome in class economical 406 people in seats of more than 17 thumbs of wide one, and will be configured with 10 seats by row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus indicates that the competing version of his A350 will transport in class economical 350 people in seats of 18 thumbs of wide configured ones in arranged of 9.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The giants of the aeronautics exchange often blows on technical questions while doing the advertising in the professional press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Today, Airbus in is called directly to the public before the aeronautical parlor of Dubaï, where the 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">One was able to go counts recently of what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financial ones of a showing photo three people against one another to the restaurant, entitled &quot;you would accept that?&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing proposes long flights mails in narrower seats than in the airplanes turbopropulseurs regional&quot;, indicated John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As the food habits change, the people increase, but the seats in the airplanes did not radically change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the beginning of the years 1970, when the jumbo 747 of Boeing defined the long trip modern mail, and turning it century, the weight of the average American of 40 to 49 years increased of 10%, according to the data of the American department of Health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The turn of size of the average American of the XXIe century is of 39.7 thumbs, according to American sanitary statistics.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus declares that his rival hangs on to a seat concept that dates back to the years 1950, when the circumference of the fresh baptized device &quot;throw set&quot; was narrower.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus adds that she ordered a study that indicates that an additional thumb at the level of the width of the seats would improve the quality of the sleep of 53%.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing protests the figures of Airbus in the matter of the width of the seats and asserts that this is not at the builders to decide manner of which the airline companies balance the price of the bills and the equipments.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It says equally that the study shows that the experience in telephone booth depends not only of the width of the seats.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It is a matter really to bring flexibility to the airline companies and to allow them to do what they think to have to do to accomplish their activities&quot;, declared Kent Craver, in charge of the fleeting satisfactions with Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want that one says them what will allow them to be profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than person.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For the passengers, it is a more matter to have a certain liberty of movement, but for the suppliers, it is more and more a question that could affect their results.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the dispute hides itself a race to the airplane orders for an estimated amount of at least 700 Md$ to the price of the market in the decades to come, sufficiently to let the balance of the American and European exportations lean.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters indicated it for the first time in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what supplies the battle between the all last devices.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Airbus and Boeing claim both of them a yield by seat in their last models of long twin-engined mails 20% superior one to the one of the leader of the market in this segment, the Boeing 777-300 ER of 365 seats.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Performances announced by Boeing depend in left the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats by row and a model 777 of configured origin in arranged of 9.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The gain in terms of unitary costs is weak compare to the configured device with 10 seats by row currently in service.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Boeing done that to be able to put more seats and return its more competitive airplanes in comparison with our products&quot;, declared Kevin Keniston, director of Fleeting Comfort with the European avionneur Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Of another side, the said analysts that the configured telephone booths with 10 seats by row in the 777 existing ones suggest that many passengers pronounce themselves in favor of a denser configuration, that can keep pace with less dear tariffs.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;A width of seat of 18 thumbs would be perfect for the passengers, but the reality is that, from the standpoint commercial, the suggestion of Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777&quot;, declared the experte in interiors of telephone booths Mary Kirby, founder and editor in boss of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing do not furnish any seats, but propose a catalog of suppliers among which these the airline companies must choose.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airplane salesmen that do the turn of the world take even with them a meter to verify the competing configurations.</seg>
		<seg id="33">While blowing itself to propose comfortable devices, all the builders offer airplanes equally with configurations to strong density to the airline companies low-cost and for the regional trips.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers one A350 configured with 10 seats by row but indicates that it did not again sell it.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus underlined the necessity of a bigger personalization of the telephone booths while offering wider seats side gone on certain of its airplanes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other big builder of big modern devices, the said experts that it is not very probable that his call to the aeronautical industry regarding to set up a norm of size for the seats results, but that it could make to forget the wave of sales of 777X.</seg>

		<seg id="15">Some use of ­beautiful projections of pictures and one ­true history as in 1789, the Lovers of the Fortress.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Of others do a leap of fifteen years behind under pretext that one can serve almost ­does not import what when one has Matt ­Pokora in poster head.</seg>
		<seg id="17">After, one has the musical comedies with the ­sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that we let the age relive of now of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the biggest one ­living composer.</seg>

		<seg id="4">For their own funerals, more and more of French choose cremation, rather than the inhumation: 53%, according to a study Ipsos realized the 6 and September 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.</seg>
		<seg id="5">For the funerals of a close one, this is the inverse one: the French prefer the inhumation (53% against 47%).</seg>
		<seg id="6">If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In his book The Death in ashes, Damien The Guay, philosopher and vice president of the national Committee of ethics of the funerary one, insists on the &quot;violence&quot; that constitutes cremation, for the survivors.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There is, with cremation, &quot;a violence done to the liked body&quot;, that will be &quot;reduced to an ash pile&quot; in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, that &quot;would accompany the phases of the mourning&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There is also &quot;a symbolic violence&quot;, that is anxious the&quot; deletion of the oddity and distinctive signs&quot; reduce to the&quot; anonymity&quot; ashes.</seg>

		<seg id="11">&quot;Because cremation is a new fact&quot;, replies Mary frédérique Bacqué, president of the Corporation of thanatologie and author of the book To Tame the death.</seg>
		<seg id="12">She is tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which limited the attempts to tame it.</seg>
		<seg id="13">To tame cremation, is for François michaud-nérard, general director of the funerary Services of the City of Paris, to foresee for the defunct one an as worthy ceremony as the one to which it would have straight with an inhumation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The annual investigation of Ipsos shows a very strong devotion to the organization of the ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="15">77% of the French in want one, for their close ones, that she is religious (53%), or civil (24%).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Henceforth, 73% of the people having chosen a cremation wish the organization of a ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="17">66% of the atheistic or not believing ones the desire also.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The crematoriums adapted themselves to this evolution of the corporation.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;Since about ten years, they strive to avoid to the families the violence of an expectation, without nothing to do, for an hour and half, immediately followed by the discount of the ashes&quot;, observes Mr. michaud-nérard.</seg>
		<seg id="20">70% of the establishments propose henceforth masters of ceremonies, that proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, name the defunct one, link up it to the others, evoke it, give feels to his death, organize the farewell.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This is the case to the crematorium of the Father Lachaise, since 1998.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The ceremony masters are often people that redeveloped themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="23">There are also Catholic former priests.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is in this framework that the crematorium of the Father Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of The Toussaint, several ceremonies of the memory, civil and not religious, to which ones it invites the families of the people that were crématisées in the year.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Return in black and white for Mary Chouinard, that presents to Dance Dances its two new choreographies of group: the first inspired inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second instilled one by the fine solos of piano Gymnopédies of Satie.</seg>
		<seg id="1">An evening that allows seeing the whole prisme of Chouinard, art to the tics and black one of inks to the white one.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A white screen uses bottom wall.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the rug, so white, in the immense space that is the Theater Maisonneuve, advances itself, of profile, fine as a line and clothed of black, a body.</seg>
		<seg id="4">On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The body, simple trait, takes his form.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And this form will be the one of the very piece: an enfilade of physical imitations of the drawings.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The dancers, completely clothed of black, only the hands and the discovered faces, await of every side of the area of game, precipitate themselves when the next written form appears, embody it, go out again while running.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This black and white game Henri Michaux is done in solo relay, in group to the unison (a mass that does solo), in big group of twelve solos where each executes his sign.</seg>
		<seg id="9">One thinks about &quot;Glory in the morning&quot;, where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a task choreographic series written on coalitions, put online in the front scene.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This is the same principle, version PowerPoint gigantic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The energy is high, the always quick rhythm.</seg>
		<seg id="13">There will be fracture when Carol Prior will take refuge himself under the dance rug, to deliver, microphone in hand, without or withheld abstemiousness, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocorde and monotonous in the screamed, and will follow while dancing.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And the music to set off again, and the sequence to resume.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This sonorous and long energetic disposal, if that can itself, ends up to deafen and deaden.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As the fact also the regularity of the visual rhythm.</seg>
		<seg id="17">There is some beautiful flashes - the picture creation always was a force with Chouinard - as these hair that tousle themselves or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But the choreographic approach lacks composition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of to go to meet the work of Michaux, imposed, with its tics.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Result: the bodies seem flat in front of the drawings.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The inks of Michaux, as forms of Gestalt, open an imaginary one wider and giboyeux than the dance, more porous.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Only the end, in negative, with its dancers minced by a light stroboscopique and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches on the magic.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The public liked, the welcome was warm.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Gymnopédies, after the entr'acte, is richer.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The scene is in left draped of gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, as furnishings in an abandoned house.</seg>
		<seg id="26">To the piano, dancers take turns to play scores.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Their clumsiness in music, touching, give a true brittleness.</seg>
		<seg id="28">On scene, pass the couples, in in love, very sensual, even erotic duets.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Group work, small solos of transitions, bodies that move themselves, choirs, the writing is less binary.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Clowns appear, so familiar of Chouinard, sporting the red nose, in parades in love men women very polarized.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Loves are carnivorous, evasive or players.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The gestural one, the laughs and the small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridiculous one of the bodies in coitus, beings that are founded.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But the piece takes his real envol after the good day.</seg>
		<seg id="34">A clown returns in scene when the public leaves.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There, all becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes superimpose themselves, the dancers ham it up, descend among the spectators, comment, smoke, runs itself circuitent, play the codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a learnedly calculated disorder that remains sensual.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The joy and the madness perspire, and this is the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The country Business for Britain was launched in April with the promise to combine the businesses and to define what the creators of wealths and of jobs want to see changed in our relation with THE E.U.</seg>
		<seg id="2">For this to do, we ordered the investigation more wide and the does more complete with the British bosses of business and asked them this than they thought about the Great Britain, businesses and of THE E.U.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov questioned more than 1 000 bosses of business, on the whole representative of all the sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for a lot.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We discovered that the vast majority of the businesses try henceforth export outside of Europe, while concentrating on the countries that modernize themselves and develop while the States of THE E.U. stagnate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want to see the government to give the priority to again commercial links with countries as China, India and Brazil rather than to get stuck in the long and difficult process reforms European institutional mysteries.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When one asks them their opinion on specific political points – going of the regulation of the monopolies to the laws on the products – the majority of the bosses of business think that the check of these competences keys should return to the hands of Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The unique market caused a general discontent, the said businesses that the cost of the regulation Brussels is disproportionate in comparison with the advantages that there is to be part of the zone of European exchanges – 40% of the big businesses, traditionally Most european most pro, are even agreed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At last, and which is more speaking again, our investigation with the business bosses revealed that an important majority wanted to see the Great Britain to follow the initiatives in favor of a change of the treaty and development of a relation with THE E.U. based on the commerce and not the political one.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This conclusion, that meet again in all the big groups and the businesses of all sizes, shows that the world of the business insists for a &quot;significant change&quot; that gives again the strength to the United Kingdom.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The issues students – to succeed in change the treaty and more better to represent the interests of the Great Britain would allow seeing a swing of 16% of the votes in favor of the maintenance of the country in THE E.U. at the time of a referendum.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Prime Minister should not doubt a single instant: this investigation shows that the British businesses support this aiming plan to renégocier the terms of the adhesion of the Great Britain to THE E.U.</seg>
		<seg id="13">She shows equally that the businesses hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of the strength in favor of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is possible, and more and more necessary, of more better to represent the interests of the British businesses, since the Euro zone is involved itself in the way of an economical and fiscal union narrower.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority must be the job and the growth in Great Britain and, as the conclusions of our investigation the watches, for the businesses that means to put again the accent on the commerce and a basic change of the statutory approach of Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="4">Indeed, the request is such in certain parties of Asia of the southeast – where the debt of the households increases – that ValueMax, where she carried out his transaction, became this week the third corporation of ready ones on pledge to be introduced to the stock market of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="5">To put as a token of the jewels is not only a quick means to obtain from cash – 1 300 $ of Singapore in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but this is almost so good market as the ready not bank guarantee.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Usually, the lenders on pledge of Singapore remove an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offers by the United Overseas Bank, a local silent partner having a succursale in the same commercial center.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Nevertheless, the lenders on pledge have the advantage of not to ask verification of creditworthiness or of proof of salary, and can unblock the ready more quickly than the banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Consequently, millions of people through the region turn themselves towards the lenders on pledge while the families feel the pressure that exercises the increase of the cost of living and the excessive debt of the households and consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of solid growth since the world-wide financial crisis, and the credit inexpensive supplied by a too lax monetary policy in the advanced economies, the families to weak and average income turn themselves towards the lenders on pledge to fill the difference while their known economies a slowdown.</seg>

		<seg id="24">The placement as a security is of better some more better accepted socially as means to obtain a guaranteed financing in the short one run.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The people that go with the lenders on pledge are not not more only those that have financial problems.</seg>

		<seg id="8">By the tears, she declared that Patek should have been condemned to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I think really that it should have followed the same way that the other men.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;It should be led in front of the small ball of execution&quot;, declared Mrs Corteen to the AAP.</seg>

		<seg id="14">It sank in the coma to the day following the attempt and remained unconscious during a months, and it is &quot;dead&quot; three times while it was under respiratory assistance.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hugues declared that Patek should have known the same goes out that the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible of the slaughter – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – that were executed 4 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In reality, this man should have been condemned to death before the others.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To keep it in life, why, there is not any reason to keep it in life.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Pass 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injured hundreds of others, this is not a lot.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last one posers of bomb of Bali to be translated in justice.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It had succeeded avoiding doing itself to capture during almost 10 years but finally was stopped in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former boss of Al-qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, less than four months later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the process, an agent of the FBI declared that of the reports of the services of piece of information had revealed that Patek was at the Pakistan to meet Bin LADEN with the intention of to reestablish links between the terrorist groups of Asia of the southeast and Al-qaeda.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;It did not return&quot;, added Mrs Corteen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently, it made fun of frantically of the sorrow that it had been able to cause to other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The verdict was returned on the eve of the 10E anniversary of the attempts that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies to Bali and in Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;There will be a lot of pleurs this year&quot;, said Mrs Corteen.</seg>
