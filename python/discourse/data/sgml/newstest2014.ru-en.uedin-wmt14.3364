		<seg id="1">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed as a result of the bombing in Bali in 2002, reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the conspirators who appeared before the court, and claimed that Umar Patek should be shot.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the creation of the explosive devices used during the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He may be released within 15 years, if you get parole.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of the attack on the two night club in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including in a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that the man nicknamed &quot;prined&quot; for his reputation as a master for making explosives, should be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This decision deepened the painful memories of the mother of Perth Curtin Joon, who lost his 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in terror, effected Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Barely restraining his tears, she said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He must appear before the stre team, &quot;said Ms. Courtin AAP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I must live every day knowing that I will no longer be grandchildren and I don't see my daughters.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;The Sari Club&quot; was destroyed when it was described in the massive bomb in a van parked outside, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was at the bar &quot;Paddy&quot; where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack with explosives, just 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="14">After that attack, he fell into a coma for a month and &quot;died&quot; three times, being connected to a life support system.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Hughes said that Patek must share the fate of the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra who were executed four years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than all.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Get 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounded hundreds - it is not so much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the participants in the terrorist attack in Bali tried.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He was a fugitive for nearly ten years, but in the end, was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed the former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in less than four months later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence data showed: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore the link between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;He did not surrender,&quot; said Ms. Courtin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently, he does not regret about how much grief he caused to other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The sentence imposed on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be seen later this year in Bali and Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;This year will be a lot of tears,&quot; says Ms. Courtin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Patek can still appeal against his sentence.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Manufacturers of the jet aircraft feud over the seat width, when large orders at stake</seg>
		<seg id="1">Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft provoke a bitter dispute about the width of tourist-class seats on long flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai air show this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights economy-class passengers whose interests are not always in the focus of airlines, with the volume of a dedicated space for them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the last planes offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for the introduction of the industry standard that would have included the seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class passengers, but its main American rival, Boeing says that it must solve the airline.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of increasingly large versions of their motor long-haul planes, and on November 17-21 event expected potentially record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Integration of the rear part of the plane - especially the whether sitting 9 or 10 people in a row - occupies a central place in statements about the economic efficiency of new projects &quot;mini-tooling.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing argues that its new 777X will contain 406 people on the basis of the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed on 10 in each row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says that a competing version of its A900 will be transported in economy-class 350 people in the 18-inch wide seats, located in nine in a row.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Giants aircraft often exchanged blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And now Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the study in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers slide, representing three people in a restaurant, pressed to each other, &quot;you would agree on it?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing is offering long-haul flights on seats more narrow than the regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">With the change of diet, people are gaining weight, but the aircraft seats have changed dramatically.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the glider Boeing 747 set the standards of modern long-distance travel, and abroad century, the average weight of American men aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Bhat waist average American men of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the U.S. Public Health Service.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus argues that its rival, adheres to the concept of the seats of the 1950s, when the average waist girth of those who recently called &quot;reactive audience&quot; was already.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus says that ordered the study, testifying that an additional inch in width seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputed Airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions on how airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.</seg>
		<seg id="18">She said studies show that convenience shop depends not only on the width of the seats.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It really comes down to providing airlines choices and opportunities to do what they think they need to do to achieve success,&quot; said Boeing specialist at Kent Craver saloon.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They don't want us to decide for them that will bring them a profit.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their job better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it increasingly becomes a factor that may affect the profits.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind this dispute is a race for orders for planes, estimated at least $700 billion computers on prices in the coming decades - enough to change the balance of the American and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As first reported in July, the Reuters news agency, the location of the seats is exactly what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest rocket planes.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing have reported a 20-percent increase in profitability in one place in their last motor long-haul models, compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Boeing claimed characteristics of partly based on a comparison of 10-local 777X ranks with the original 9-local layout rows of constructive solutions to the 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Winning the specific cost is reduced when compared with the 10-local layout used nowadays.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Under the using down the statue Samora Machel, president and founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo, chanting slogans about the world on one of the rare demonstrations here.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want to return the world; we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sus, executive director of the investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Fearing for the future of their country, she replaced a business suit on a T-shirt decorated with the inscription &quot;We demand security&quot; in Portuguese, and joined on Thursday to a crowd in the capital's Independence Square.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo is one of the most violent clashes since the cease-fire for more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo once was known rebel movement, which was driven by the first white authorities Rhodesia, and then the government of the apartheid-era South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the government of an independent country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After the 1992 truce, it has become an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again falls to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have forced nervous foreign investors and local residents.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stakes are high for a growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling party Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and the party Renamo accused each other of responsability tension.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The party Renamo argues that the government has become the last big clashes, attacking its members in the province of diseases brought, a traditional point of Renamo, on October 17.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The attacks on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked the base Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, a leader of the group, told the Financial Times newspaper Fernando Mazanga, Renamo spokesman.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government blames Renamo in initiating clashes, accusing the party in the attack on the soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza sought to dispel fears about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt &quot;loser&quot; sathee use &quot;all that is left of his forces to try to prove that he can impose the government's own decisions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">As Frelimo and Renamo insist that want to avoid war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">However, fears grew after reports that Renamo Mazanga said of the refusal of the 1992 peace agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the Financial Times that meant failure to comply with the agreement Frelimo party.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our goal is to return to the talks, but seriously,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease tension, which led to a series of clashes this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;It's two influential person (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who heads,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them is not a good negotiator and none of them are not ready to go on the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve the electoral reform, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections, scheduled for November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators interpreted it as an effort to pressure oslabevshego movement to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The share of the vote for Renamo declines since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former member of the Renamo is expected to improve its performance in this election.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, who must go down in the next year, when the end of his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want to multi-party democracy, he does not want to transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he did not want to leave the presidency,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">News up to the possibilities Renamo, but she already has devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from the north to the south.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the clashes took place in the province of diseases brought, which is located a few hundred miles to the north of Maputo, but includes Beirut's port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad tracks about a week after Renamo threatened to attack on the railroad.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mazanga declince was when he was asked a question about whether Renamo repeat this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The party Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not very good,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Instability strengthened the discontent with the government, but many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and increased kidnappings recently, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media companies Mediacoop.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that the responsibility for the future of the country have a government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultan, a member of the demonstration, said that people simply want stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;No one cares neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they simply want to the resumption of peace, they want free access to roads,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Earlier studies have shown that satisfied the dog wild tail in the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while the dog alarmed pahing tail mainly on the left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other members of the canid family can ignore these subtle differences in vilain tail and respond to them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from Trent University, says: &quot;It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain differently are involved in shaping the precursors that cause positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here, we try to look at it and other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that as a person, dogs have the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs react to various piling tails of other dogs, the researchers observed animals when they watched movies about other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the frequency of heartbeat of animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Perhaps soon we understand why their tails sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes - in another</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have shown the video dogs with dogs - or naturalistic version or silhouette in order to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and guide the tail more left or right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals seen that otherwise nothing conveyed the dog was driven by the tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog wily tail), they were completely relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they noticed that the tail tended mostly to the left (again from the point of view of a dog wily tail), their heartbeat ass and they looked alarmed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that dogs are deliberately communicated with each other using these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from his experience, about what movements they should worry, and what is not.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He says: &quot;If there is a couple of meetings with other dogs and often vile them to one side of the tail is associated with a more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that these results may give the owners, vets and dresses a deeper understanding of the emotions of its animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">An expert in the field of dog behavior John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the Veterinary School of Bristol University, said that it was not the first study to examine whether the value for dogs left and right hand.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if you look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if you look at the devil dog.</seg>

		<seg id="19">He said that the difference could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies do not fully perceived animals in films or dogs and robots as dogs.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April, with the obligation to gather representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in relations with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To this end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in the UK in size, sector and region.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The findings of the survey will be a surprise for many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking for export opportunities beyond Europe, paying particular attention to countries that hold modernization and grow, while EU countries are stagnating.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want the government dad priority of the new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reforming the complicated EU institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to the laws on products, the majority of business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Presented general dissatisfaction with the single market and business representatives said that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits from the presence in Europe's trade zone, &quot;agreed with this even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-minded of all companies.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The last and most indicative of our business leaders, the poll found that a clear majority wants the United Kingdom conducted a course on climate treaty and the relationship with the EU based on trade and not on politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This result, which was among the enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business insists on a &quot;significant change&quot; that will bring powers back to Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are high - achieving changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide a 16-percent shift in voting to remain in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The prime minister, there should be no doubt: This poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that the business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the balance of power back toward Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The best conditions for British businesses are possible and become increasingly necessary as the eurozone comes on the path of closer economic and financial integration.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Priority should be given jobs and economic growth in the UK, and the results of our survey for business, it means the increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulatory activities of Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="6">However, doctors and nutritionists believe in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia to adhere to such stringent standards in nutrition, at least poles for health.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A complete rejection of animal products harmful.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In animal proteins are irreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for the plant.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We must necessarily include a diet at least milk or eggs, &quot;says nutritionist Marina Bay.</seg>
		<seg id="10">She cites the example of the fish containing an indispensable fatty acid omega-3.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The most rich them vegetable oil, linseed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;To consume it in the necessary for the person quantities, l need to drink!&quot; Says nutritionist.</seg>

		<seg id="14">In this season of vegetarianism is particularly salient.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In terms of our realities, the demands made food.</seg>
		<seg id="16">To do not freeze, need a high calorie.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;If a person is limiting themselves on animal products, respectively, this caloric Monty,&quot; says the specialist.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With this agrees doctor-nutritionist Olga Spanish.</seg>
		<seg id="19">She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the solution.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is better to eat mostly products, which are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The genetic code is configured for the best entity and the acquisition of these products.</seg>

		<seg id="27">Organism for life energy needs, and it is, above all, fat, &quot;the physician concludes.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The doctors say that vegan diets especially harmful to children and pregnant women.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Children grow up, they need a construction material, including in the form of amino acids.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And adhering to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.</seg>

		<seg id="40">&quot;The quality of products is not something,&quot; says Begay.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Arifulina also notes that supplied and hothouse vegetables and fruits are far from perfect standards.</seg>

		<seg id="43">&quot;Apples do not become brown on the minerals, quickly turn yellow and plesneveut cucumbers, tomatoes and flashy aromatic&quot; - gives examples of a physician, adding that they are likely to spoon excessive amounts of fertilizer.</seg>
		<seg id="44">And become suppliers are not vitamins and fiber.</seg>
		<seg id="45">With this disagrees zavlaboratoriei Siberian Physics and Technical Institute for Agricultural Issues, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.</seg>
		<seg id="46">She says that with the right approach and observance of all standards and requirements in greenhouses may grow full-fledged vegetables.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Attempts to solve transportation problems of major cities were observed in most cities in the world since the second half of the 20th century.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As a rule, it was either about their rebuilding and expansion of highways, or about the attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and time of their use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It is widely known example of Singapore, where introduced strict quota increase in the number of private cars, and the right to their acquisition is bought at auction.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Its price may be two to three times more than the price of the car.</seg>
		<seg id="5">European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the center of the city.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called green zone, which is allowed to enter only cars with certain eclass using high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).</seg>
		<seg id="7">Beijing's environmental protection agency, for example, approved in 2012, &quot;the five-year plan of clean air,&quot; with a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).</seg>
		<seg id="8">As told Kommersant, director of the Department of Transport pollution of the municipal environmental protection bureau of Beijing Li Kunsheng, the main aim of the plan is to reduce the major air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, the increase in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as the increase of no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the agency, now vehicles in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Among the major measures of the program is to limit the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Among other things, the urban measures &quot;green&quot; five include accelerated compared with the rest of the country's transition to ENs fuel, the introduction of the local system standards and labelling of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars in the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (besides, the creation of a financial incentive programs to replace the old cars on hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-speed).</seg>
		<seg id="12">Among automotive innovations in Beijing also include a ban on all private vehicles on the movement within the fifth ring transport (all in the Chinese capital, six of them) one day a week (relevant information is contained in the number sign of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of the registration numbers for the cars on the basis of the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to the existing Programme &quot;Environmental Protection for 2012-2020,&quot; the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012, there were 138).</seg>
		<seg id="14">According to the Ministry, in 2011 on &quot;mobile sources&quot; had 41% of all emissions of pollutants in the atmosphere of the cities.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In Moscow, for example, the emissions from cars in ten times higher than the industry, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the Russian Federation until just beginning to think about the possibilities of the restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The director of the Institute of Economics of transport and transport policies HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car trips, is patently unpopular, they can be accepted by society only under the condition of their utter universality.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts - official and personal cars, as well as the cars &quot;privileged&quot; users, the total number of not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow).</seg>
		<seg id="19">The other day urbanists will from the center of Expertize ECOM in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzed the balance of urban areas between residential development, the area of pavement and a number of vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The main findings of researchers: Downtown secured roads in two times less than the required, and the majority of motorists living in the city, do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in the car parks or on the streets.</seg>
		<seg id="21">As a result, it is proposed to build not parking and storage of cars, not to expand and reduce roadway (to the streets became more friendly to pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the security zone of the historic center (with a total area of approximately 3212 hectares, covering a number of central districts of the city).</seg>

		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bell and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In this West African country of doctors are not so much - just one in 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Progolosuyte here or through your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main characters that he became the CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This person will receive $250,000 for the continuation of his outstanding work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father came back to life and again fell into the unconscious state, wandering around the hospitals, which were not properly equipped to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jameh Belle was injured in a car accident in 1981, not far from Yaounde, capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At first, he was only a broken arm, but the augmented infection spread to the brain and caused hematoma, which recalled about himself until the end of life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;In Cameroon was not neurosurgeons,&quot; said Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If we had the money, we would have taken him from Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Belle years accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment that they could get.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It's not easy,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;You can go out of the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be first, but you are not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Patients are very much.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some may die due to the fact that they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation is not much has changed since Belle's father died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon, only one doctor for 5,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">By comparison, the ratio in the United States - one doctor for 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if the Camerons could go to the doctor, many of them it would be unaffordable.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two of the five people in this country are living below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the cost of health care in it are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Their only problem is poverty,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;And because of the poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his countrymen, Belle became determined to do something about it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a doctor and a vascular surgeon at the Yaounde Central Hospital.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips into the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers had helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday he and even up to 30 people clod in vans, tie to the roofs medical supplies and cross-country travel to visit the need of assistance to the village.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It is not always brings good luck.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Not once they had to push the car through the river and dirt.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they are the true heroes: This holiday with songs and dances and the best facilities, which can only offer local residents.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration, and Belle with his broad smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the brigade begins to take hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We accept 500 people in each trip,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come from all over the neighborhood within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases sexually transmitted infections.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others may get the walkers, donated glasses or free birth certificate - documents needed for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening, the brigade spends a simple surgery under local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Operations, as a rule, are held in the building of the school, the municipality or at home; after the procedure, patients up and go into a persistent area to make room for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitary processing equipment, Belle and his volunteers are working until the early hours of Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is a crippling pace, but the determination of the brigade usually help maintain the village musicians.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They all night to beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, weary, but proud of his work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group, composed of Cameroon foreign doctors and medical students, has spent 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their assistance can have enormous implications for those who they are helping.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One man explained that they received free surgery for a hernia treatment will allow him to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;This will change the future for me and my family,&quot; said the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to these clinical methods on weekends and work in a hospital surgeon Belle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It is this second work, he said, provides 60% of the financing of his nonprofit organization; the rest of the funds are covered by private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I don't even know when he sleeps,&quot; said Kathy O Malley, a second year student called Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer at Belle group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He has always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization to continue the campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For future doctors and nurses, such as O 'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join the Belle in the implementation of its goals, it is an opportunity to practice that they would never have received at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We were able to assist in operations where we helped to remove blood stains or keep the tools for Belle doctors,&quot; said O Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">As a student-sophomore, you would never have received such a possibility in America.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The students and volunteers are usually pay their travel to Cameroon, often coming from pojertvovanmi medicines.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But on arrival in Yaounde their food, transport and education pays Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He's a hero, without a doubt,&quot; said O Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Belle almost constant workload of work is not a serious challenge.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Help to live a happy life to others, to fulfill the promise of his father is what brings him great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I do this job,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot;And I think about my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees that I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I do it so that people laughed in order to reduce their pain.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in the United States will hold a new name - &quot;Community of the circle.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">This week, the black list of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in America replenished with new names and four companies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The US Treasury introduced the &quot;Community of the circle of the&quot; three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis.</seg>
		<seg id="3">One of the Russians was a well-known singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspected of transporting money for the members of the group.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In all, the U.S. blacklist of 22 people involved in &quot;brat circle,&quot; and six organizations affiliated with him.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nevertheless, many experts have expressed doubts that this organization really exists.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The statement of the 'Bratsk circle' more like an attempt to unite the disparate criminal gangs,&quot; said previously organized crime expert and professor at the University of New York, Mark galeotti.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In his opinion, &quot;Community of the circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of the &quot;Russian mafia.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;I haven't seen anyone in Russian law enforcement bodies or anywhere else, who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization,&quot; Mr. Galleotti American Center for the Study of corruption and organized crime.</seg>
		<seg id="9">With Mr. Galleotti agrees and George Mason University professor Liz Shelley.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;If they work together, then it is more like a criminal network, but not the organization,&quot; - leads her words of the Center for Research on corruption and organized crime.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the middle of last year, Mark galeotti suggested that the &quot;Community of the circle&quot; unites more confidants of Russian thieves in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hassan.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus, the activity of the Ashkenazi Laci and Zacharias Kalashov, extended list in 2012, was closely connected with Grandfather Khasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, Hasan had bison nephew.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Yet Mr. galeotti notes that some of the personality and does not have a relationship to Usoyan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In his opinion, all of them united, rather common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the &quot;Community of the circle,&quot; Grigori Leps - the beloved singer Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of the Kremlin.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Goldman Sachs warned of the risks for the Russian economy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for the main driver fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It is primarily a crisis of arrears on unsecured consumer loans and layoffs.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Our main concern now is not what growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Lately he's totally driven by consumption, which is almost not lifting the turnovers, &quot;said Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia, Clemens Grafe, presenting Quarterly Report investment bank yesterday on the Russian economy.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Now, the nominal wage growth in Russia - about 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="6">With inflation at 6%, he will be able to ensure the future consumer demand around the current level, expect to Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But the profitability of Russian companies falls, however, most likely, they will optimize staff costs.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: If wages are rising by 10% of GDP - only 2%, &quot;explained Mr. Graf.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Companies were faced with declining profitability.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If it does not grow, it could lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Do not raise the salaries of Russian business may not, said Barclays Capital's chief economist for Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantyushin.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Unemployment near historical lows, the competition for workers is high.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In order to attract employees from or keep the current, employers have to raise wages.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Consumption in Russia power ­ potrebcreditovania jets and very fast growth.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to Mr. Graf, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplicative effect on the economy of the country, this type of lending does not.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;Potrebcreditovania pools for the economy from the growth we did not see any of the money does not differ on the economy and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments,&quot; said the economist.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But the problem in another - at Goldman Sachs expect growth in arrears on unsecured credit.</seg>
		<seg id="18">They are mostly rich people who have nothing to offer the software.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The interest on such loans high.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, they often do not return, &quot;said Mr. Graf.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Therefore, the second threat to growth in Russia - a possible crisis arrears on unsecured credit.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The director of the Banking Institute of Economics, Vasily Solodkov now sees signs of their looming banking crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Small credit organizations without access to cheap resources, which have owned banks were forced to raise funds for the population at a high interest rate.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In response, the state budget went on the warpath and began to cut lending rates, &quot;the economist continued.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Small credit organizations cannot lend loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If the state budget will not abandon dumping, Russia threatens to full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.</seg>
		<seg id="27">A holder of the licenses of some banks in recent weeks, the economist believes the harbinger of mass collapse.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;The state budget couldn't cope with such a situation: The deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis,&quot; the head of the institute.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But consumption growth will slow and without the crisis of arrears, believed in Investbank, &quot;due to the refusal of indexing salaries of civil servants and the military, inherent in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Part of the blow to the consumption will be reduced tariff freeze natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, the decline in inflation).</seg>
		<seg id="31">But only partially: If investments don't rise (and there are no preconditions for this - see certificate), consumption growth is still slow, sure of Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital until it sees the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.</seg>
		<seg id="33">&quot;The main risk is still fall in oil prices,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In his estimation, Russia's economy will shrink at the price of oil below 90 dollars per barrel.</seg>
		<seg id="35">At Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank has not been able to reduce interest rates in the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There is a paradox: Inflation has fallen, and banks have been raising rates.</seg>
		<seg id="37">This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, a renegade targeting transition to inflation, &quot;said Clemens Grafe.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The interest policy of the Central Bank on market rates do not affect, affects only the interbank lending rates.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;For the Central Bank is the failure of all the hopes,&quot; praised Clemens Grafe.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The money received at auctions of the Central Bank, banks are not lending to the economy and to manage its liquidity</seg>
		<seg id="41">Once the reduced rate, immediately changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the ruble.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy is not working,&quot; said Mr. Graf and reminded that let the ruble in a &quot;free float&quot; state plans by the end of 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But will have to either do it sooner, or raise a key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he said.</seg>
		<seg id="44">In his estimation, the rate of the ruble now artificially overvalued by 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Ruble only one road is weakening, &quot;concludes the expert.</seg>
		<seg id="46">But if the Central Bank seront financial specialists in a shadow of a doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy on the weakening of the ruble, it could bring the ruble is much stronger.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Fau: &quot;Air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes (but not call from a mobile phone).&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but did not speak on mobile phones, &quot;according to a long-awaited new guidelines, published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that the changes occur immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, said FAA Administrator Michael Worth Botanic Garden at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Companies will have to show the FAA as their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their textbooks for members of the flight crew and rules for the installation of devices to meet the new guidelines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Fau announced that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines, which have already submitted plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the state of the plan we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the plane door is closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They do not have to restart them until the plane did not reach the heights of 10,000 feet and the captain did not give &quot;good.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane goes down for planting, and do not include them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In accordance with the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and steering, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most of the new airliners and other planes, modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the Association of professional stewards, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;After the new policy will be implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win solution,&quot; said Glading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We are frankly tired of feeling &quot;duty on the school&quot; when it comes to this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the connection to the Internet for surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thus, still no &quot;Words with Friends&quot; - the intellectual online game, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was a notable case: The actor was removed from an American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the plane was at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And more severe devices, such as laptops, still need to be carried in the luggage, because they can injure someone if they fly around the salon.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also remain banned.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Regulation powers on telephone calls are owned by the Federal Communications Commission, and not the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Fau may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Council for Transport Safety, a national security expert at the carriage of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered risky.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Cell phones is really a problem, not only because they can potentially create obstacles for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they may interfere with cellular towers when the plane is in the air,&quot; said Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to study the issue, recommended last month that the government has authorized the wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years, heightening the pressure on the FAA to easing restrictions on their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics, such as Senator from Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill, argue that there is no good reason for prohibitions related to security.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Compliance with the restrictions also becomes increasingly difficult to provide, as the use of the devices has become commonplace.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions turn off their devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fu began to limit the use of passengers of electronic devices in 1966, in response to reports of impediments encountered for navigation and communications equipment, when the passengers began to wear a FM radios - high-tech gadgets of the time.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The new airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of planes, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines are offering passengers to use Wi-Fi for cruising altitude for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The planes, modified for Wi-Fi systems, also more resistant to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of the aircraft adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, said Worth Botanic Garden.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices usually emit radio much lower power than previous generations of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals at relisted pages.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the signals are becoming more powerful when downloading devices or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among those who sought easing restrictions on the use of the passengers of electronic devices, the company Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, the company's representatives have downloaded a airliner with their devices for reading electronic books the Kindle and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the advisory committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices pose any risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of airline passengers said he believes interference from the actual devices, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other members of the committee said that there are only some of the messages pilots, confirming that the device may interfere with the aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA has allowed pilots to require passengers to disable the device during landings on devices in poor visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed the changes, calling them sensible step toward passengers who now use a lot of technological devices.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that the FAA acknowledges that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The scientists have developed antinicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests are needed before the trials on humans, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the first results are reassuring.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We very much hope that such a strategy of using a vaccine may finally help millions of smokers who try to quit, Surrogate all methods available on the market today, but discovered that their nicotine dependence strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern facilities,&quot; said Professor Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Antibodies stalked by any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker nicotine strike.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The mouse vaccine tests, which subsequently gave the nicotine, continued their normal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And the mouse, which did not give the vaccine, &quot;rasslablalisy,&quot; and it is a sign that nicotine reached out to their brain, &quot;say the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contain antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to do so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns the liver cells in the factory antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could give the children before they will be willing to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They will know that if they begin to smoke again, they do not get the pleasure of a nicotine vaccine, and it may help them get rid of this habit,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned that further studies are needed.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for what they sneaked hand luggage on board his flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda pop, although their announcement on Wednesday's verdict that passengers will be able to leave the rest of the bank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new hand baggage fee applies to the bag in the upper luggage compartments, however small bags, placed under the seat remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said that it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelling will pay only caught at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Predstavitelnita Frontier Kate O Malley said that a fee of $100 should make the passengers take care about the payment in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We do not want to charge for it,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The carriers have started to charge for the first and second bag, probably in luggage, in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers trying to avoid these fees, the line as much as they can in hand baggage, placed in upper luggage compartments, these compartments are often not enough space.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees is one of the ways to get carry fewer passengers on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O 'Malley said that this new fee is actually not for the sake of making money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The point is that the most loyal customers of the Frontier say that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, does not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that one passenger in line at the Frontier flight may get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while another passenger in the queue may pay $100 for the same bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O 'Malley said that changing the procedures on the web site and at check-Frontier intended to ensure that passengers will know about gathering before they get to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The new collection of Frontier for hand luggage will not apply until the summer, although the date has not been set.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often complain of fees for baggage and other fees, but the airline of their love.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service, should pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street believe adding baggage fees sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However, the majority of them are not touched fees for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. has introduced the first hand baggage fee three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such a gathering is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the extra fees.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In his assessment in a report from December 2011, hand baggage fee brings the Spirit of $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew flight Spirit, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, where passengers will face an unusual collection of Spirit for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The landing was very smooth from those that I have seen in my career in the airlines,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the landing was rapidly.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also follows the Spirit of fee of $2 for coffee, tea, soda pop or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier said that passengers who get soda pop or juice, can leave yourself all the bank and that Dole coffee will be provided free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="29">She still will be handing out free water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Us Airways while trying to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned it after seven months after the passengers began to complain and no other major airline has not followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The initiative to levy the Frontier hand baggage fees when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last resort to attract customers on its Web site.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, and does not apply to the online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">However, the Frontier went further than all in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, she began to give two times less bonus miles often flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday presale she cut the number of miles up to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Thus, the trip to 1,000 miles from the Frontier, acquired by the online travel agency, would get 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the site of the Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but its business is declining and becomes unprofitable.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Revenue fell by 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results, published on Wednesday parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic is trying to mend finances Frontier within the sale of the airline.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European country that recognized the third floor of the children born to the exterior intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Broden will no longer need to attribute the male or female gender.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as an &quot;uncertain&quot; or &quot;undetermined&quot; in their birth certificates.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who can take hasty decisions about operations for Assigned newborn sex, and counteract discrimination intersexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One intersexual people, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I am not a man and not a woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will stay created doctors patchwork of product with bruises and scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">About one out of two thousand children born each year, is neither a boy or girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of &quot;violations of sexual development&quot; is a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (mines or seeds) or unusually ravishing exterior.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson, perhaps was intersexual.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Gender identification is still poorly studied, but most experts in the US say that if the floor cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign him than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the surgery, if it happens at all.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said that the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have a life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but the majority of children do not have them,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can assign the floor without the surgery and then see how develops personality.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Science about how the child will develop any gender identity, not too accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one can answer questions about why this is happening.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is like a mystery about why people being homosexual.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersexual people as different from the transgender or transgender, because their condition is not disaggregated, but to their biological structure that does not correspond to exclusively neither male nor female, and typically for both simultaneously or not typical for either one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics may emerge in secondary sexual symptoms such as muscle mass, hair distribution, chest and physique; primary sexual symptoms, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and regenerating.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives a general idea of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The boys with gender disorders now has a special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put a male, female or &quot;third gender&quot; in its official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia Welby-year, police became the first person in the world, acknowledged &quot;pole,&quot; having upheld in court the right to preserve &quot;vague&quot; sexual status for life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will be used by a third designation in addition to M &amp; F-X, i.e. intersexual.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues still cause contradictions, according to a news release on the channel France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this strongly Catholic country, signed a petition to confiscate a &quot;gender theory&quot; of school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The American Catholic Online Web site also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity - no, we still Praid two pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">One mother of the newborn baby from Maryland also told the Web site Baby Zone that she would prefer that the children set the floor at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Raise child is difficult and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,&quot; she said of the Web site for parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The children need stability and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born with male and female sex organs, called hermaphrodites - named a beautiful Greek god who wielded the characteristics of both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And yet, just ten years ago, the medical community stand gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then draw again.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now, many are questioning the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to perceive him to the floor as an adult.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the middle of the 20th century, it was called&quot; urgent mental case &quot;,&quot; Drescher said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When such children were born, you are not called psychiatrist - you rang the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Dominating theory about how to deal with children with genitals intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender easily amenable to change.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He introduced the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that the signals of the environment, including social - how parents raise the child, &quot;interact with genes and hormones of the child, determining whether people consider himself a man or woman.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one case, 1966, known as the &quot;John / Joan&quot; his theories have been called into question.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during the negligent circumcision, fully castrate child, removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not true,&quot; Drescher said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When he was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But in the 38 years he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher said that now, some doctors are still &quot;apply this model.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived the sex-change operation, said about himself, &quot;unhappy with the result.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from the state of Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but genitals intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors could not accurately determine whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a &quot;normal life&quot; men.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, the external sexual organ and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He began to give female hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I was not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But being in depression and realizing that something is wrong, he demanded the medical documentation.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he learned, it was terrible.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at birth, and no one has ever told me about it.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a violation of sexual development, which gave him the body to produce enough testosterone for the normal development of the genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Learning the truth, he again became a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing their breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The operation has made his fruitless.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, he is acting in defense of others in the organization under the name Interface Project, trying to lead a normal perception of people with intersexuality.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California legal association Advocates for informed Choice, concerned that the German law &quot;urges labelled and stigma.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take hasty decision and give the child&quot; uncertain &quot;floor,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that he will promote the intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We believe that it is better to assign a male or female sex, and then wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we have not seen the show themselves this law, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third floor.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adult people should have the opportunity to make their own decisions about the formal sex,&quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law implies its assignment at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">It is a battle in which young children should not enter at this stage.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, mammal ultrasound diagnostician from Pittsburgh, which has a daughter with a violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law &quot;support&quot; as parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Bart daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development called &quot;full nechuvstvitelnosti syndrome to androgens.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because its androgenic receptors are working correctly, Kathy developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now, at 29 years, Kathy married and passes studies in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Despite the fact that she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy motherhood.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents the time not to take hasty decisions by themselves,&quot; said Bart.</seg>
		<seg id="76">He gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this case, you in order to raise a child, like a child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">Do you have a wonderful child, and you feel the joy.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We don't need to hastily to do the operation that is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that motivates parents, because they do not feel they are doing the right thing,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">After all, the child will decide how floor he or she is more comfortable - and it is wonderful.</seg>
		<seg id="82">It gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On Thursday, the Federal District Court suspended the execution of the court decision, demanding changes in the program &quot;stop-iost&quot; New York Police Department, and ousted the judge from the case.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Court of Appeal of the second US District said that the execution of the decisions of a judge Shira Scheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of appeals filed city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how he performed a program on the street detention and interrogation.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city appealed on its decision and the decision of the corrective measures, including a requirement to appoint the controller to help the police department to change work practices and related training program.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On Thursday, the appeals court heard oral hearing on the request to suspend the case.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Court of Appeal said about the need to remove judges due to the fact that she violated the Code of Conduct of U.S. Judges and not posts with the need to avoid demonstrations of bias, partly due to a series of interviews to the media and official statements containing the public response to criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge ruled that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably referring to black and Hispanic under the program &quot;stop-iost.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="13">In 2004, four people, all - representatives of national minorities, filed a class action filed in court.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Supporters of the changes in the program &quot;stop-iost&quot; in the New York Police Department said that these changes will end unfair practices, to forge a more reliable and effective police service and can affect how other police departments implement this practice.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Opponents argue that the changes reduce the morale of police, rather than the level of criminality, will lead to unnecessary expenditure of money and will not solve a global problem of complex conditions in police due to reduce the number of officers at several thousand over the last decade.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of &quot;stop-iost&quot; that complies with the constitution, but changes the way how New York police stops of people.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The federal government insists that the bailout package of $325 million for Tasmania's weak health systems will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the state government did not spend the money wasted.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent measures&quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the aging of the population of this island state, higher levels of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The decision on funding for four years, was taken after consultation with the government of Tasmania's deputy independent Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems facing state,&quot; said Ms. Plibersek today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The package of $325 million includes $31 million on a blitz-campaign for planned operations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and surgery to remove cataracts, will help bridge the gap.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There is also money for clinics that accept patients without reservation, in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after the patient, the training of medical specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments will go on leading doctors expressed by the implementation of ideas on how best to help Tasmania's health system,&quot; said Ms. Plibersek.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted that Tasmania's government will work in a strict accountability and responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="10">State will need to maintain the current levels of funding in order to receive the funds of the Commonwealth, and the monthly report about where he spends these additional funds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The commission will be created from three people to make sure that the state provides services as more efficient and powerful.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will solve nothing, &quot;if they do not follow the real reform that will put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless, he praised the government for a response to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first asked the prime minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I hope that the federal aid package will greatly facilitate the withdrawal of the state of the health care system from a critical condition,&quot; said Mr Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the state government, these additional selective procedures are largely offset recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement represents &quot;solution, a similar leycoplasteru.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason we are here is that the state Labor government ripped $430 million from the health care system,&quot; he told ABC television TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When the government lifts the state almost half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth is investing 300 million, you cannot pretend that this is good news.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek guarantee that no one dollar from the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I voted for President Obama twice, dividing the hope for the possibility of change</seg>

		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris, a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I read a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I thought that this book will inspire me in times of gloom in the second year of medical faculty and revive in me a sense of hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;dare for victory,&quot; and it's memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I finish the evening to write reports on my patients and go to bed, this book brings me at a time when the policy inspired millions of people, and the speech could capture the spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The victory in the elections was formidable, and the leading news programs were doing a pause for reflection of this historical moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates wept with joy, and my parents who guarded all the newspapers that they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At the White House had come a young team of strategists, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During Obama's entry into the office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Return at present is a rude awakening, as verging of dreams.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years that have passed since I dropped his first ballot, the changes actually occurred.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was something that I could not even imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I give Obama credit for his large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the abolition of rules of the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, I believe that the party has blocked obstructionism too many attempts to promote our country forward: Immigration reform, the choice of public health and the closure of the base at Guantanamo, among others.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after countless number of times when I've been on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I ended the explanation that I can provide.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I reached a point of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Obstructionism Republicans cannot explain the permission to prosesu foreign leaders or striking pilots on innocent children in other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He cannot explain the collection of data about the private lives of Americans, the National Security Agency or the persecution of the whistleblower, outlines the government's misconduct.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He could not explain the murder of an American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, without charge or trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which says that the attachments White House effort to silence the media, are &quot;the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And lately he cannot justify what cannot develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I don't know whether I should expect it.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Should I was at the age of 18 years to understand that the administration may contradict the political campaigns that precede him?</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is obvious that the work on an elective office is not a predictable program of action, because our public dialogue will be formed an opposition political party and random events such as the carnage in Newtown.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Yet for all listed above me examples show that they were largely on their own choice of administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And this is what bothers me most of all.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney was an obvious and crass alternative, it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on their own policies or views.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I believed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, meets that we've heard for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, when this week, Obama's approval rating dipped below 45%, back in 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me homesick for many promises that uletuchilisy.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton dealt Obama deafening defeat in the primary election in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At a meeting on the analysis of the causes of the failure, he told his employees that they should go back to normal and remain true to its goal.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want that we returned our appeal,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;We must remember about who we are.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="42">It has been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.</seg>

		<seg id="4">He took the oath before 18 black-robed judges in the court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was banned organization round, a target for tough action by successive governments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen, when Morsi arrived with a small cortege shortly after 11 a.m. local time.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential fanfare Mubarak's era, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on the normally busy road linking the city centre with the southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Although Morsi uncharismatic ridiculed as &quot;spare wheel,&quot; &quot;Brothers,&quot; his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and headline performances, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate, not just Islamists, but also all those who want to bring the matter before the end of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak's authoritarian.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; said Morsi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, the judges in obit wood panelling hall where he took the oath.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to pronounce his inauguration speech.</seg>

		<seg id="13">Products military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.</seg>
		<seg id="14">His arrival was met with the slogan &quot;Army and the people are one hand&quot; who chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s, has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising began, servivce Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to return the powers of the president, which his office was deprived of the military council that has made the case against the deposed leader.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But agreeing to accept the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he performs the will of the military, and it is a sign that the power struggle will continue.</seg>

		<seg id="3">German media say the BfV had hoped to discover the antenna observation equipment, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Clapper said, Director of National Intelligence, the United States, in September, again assured that the United States will not use the possibility of foreign intelligence &quot;for the theft of commercial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden is a contractual employee who became razoblachitelem - began to publish its treasury of US intelligence secrets, European governments and executives are not sure whether to believe the director on the word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in the cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of corporations, caused by the state's wiretapping, to new heights.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The last straw was the news that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel auditioned, perhaps about ten years.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the most influential person in Europe may be a target, then, of course, are potential targets and business leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the United States and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I think it is quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Germany must wake up,&quot; says Oliver Grun, president of the association BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="12">German companies are convinced that the United States now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July, consulting agency EY.</seg>
		<seg id="13">All of the documents uncovered by Mr. Snowden, nevertheless, still do not have evidence that the United States passed the trade secrets of foreign companies in their own companies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that he should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.</seg>

		<seg id="22">Yet the scope and the technical development agencies under the US espionage, became famous thanks to J. Snowden revelations, were the shock for some companies, which previously thought that the biggest risk of surveillance is China.</seg>

		<seg id="2">However, on November 1 figurant affairs &quot;Oboronservis&quot; broke the silence.</seg>

		<seg id="22">Perhaps, as a woman, she could not respond to the accusation in bad taste?</seg>
		<seg id="23">Or are right journalists &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; ill repute a couple of days ago that she &quot;sunk into a greater trance under house arrest&quot; because of the news about reconciliation, Anatoly Serdyukov, with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?</seg>

		<seg id="2">The transport minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project &quot;will unite Britain.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was &quot;delighted&quot; by the prospect of working on a plan with the British government.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The first round will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">When will be completed the Second Step, the line will be built in Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In June, the government raised the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed line between London and the north of England with £12.2 to £42.6 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Britain's government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, mandated by the HS2 Ltd to consider further improvement of the railway capacity and reducing the length of trips to the North of England and Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This should include the ability to overcome the path from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal of HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make the UK and its cities closer to each other.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring, are huge.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Without him, we will face a crisis of bandwidth in our rail network.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But it also comes to transport links cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive the best message thanks to HS2.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">On behalf of the Scottish Government Keith Brown urged Mr. Carmichael &quot;unequivocally&quot; to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Brown said: &quot;The high-speed railway has all the chances to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in a common argument for high-speed railroad across the UK.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">Therefore, we are happy to work in partnership with the British government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and a continuation of the railway line, Glasgow, Edinburgh, which is already planning to Scottish government.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The deprivation of the status of the media insisted ABTA - for the systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.</seg>
		<seg id="3">During the process was created by a bad precedent: The court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the right to rebut.</seg>
		<seg id="4">What is &quot;Rosbalt.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;Information agency Rosbalt&quot; was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In subsequent years, the agency has opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Also, the agency has offices in the countries of the former Soviet Union.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since 2001, &quot;Rosbalt&quot; evolved and functioned as a federal information-analytical agency.</seg>
		<seg id="9">By the mid-2000s agency included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Los Angeles Times has always held a very specific niche: The nucleus of exclusive agency publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Talk about the next edition to the security forces continued throughout the existence of the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Along with the fact that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; had a broad base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions talked and what led the project was Natalia Chaplin's wife, Viktor Cherkesov.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This Chaplin role in leadership &quot;Rosbalt&quot; until the end is not clear: It is often referred to as &quot;the head of the project.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Director General of the agency is Larisa Afonin, editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Recently, &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is not involved in the ratings of federal media - neither the quote, nor in the audience.</seg>

		<seg id="22">ABTA discovered the video accused &quot;Rosbalt&quot; for the gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and turned to the courts to take over the agency license.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In &quot;Rosbalt&quot; stated that the agency claims bogus: First, the videos were not redaction materials, secondly, the meeting, the words were masked in them, and, in the third, immediately after the warning videos were removed from the site.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Representatives of the agency appealed Roscomnadzor claims in the world court - and when the October 22, 2013 Roscomnadzor Court has accepted the lawsuit, consider these complaints have continued.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, the world number 25, the judge decided not to favor &quot;Rosbalt&quot;: Editor Nicholas Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 rubles - about 10 thousand for each clip.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Obviously, this predecide and the outcome of the hearing in Khodorkovsy - if to abandon the idea that the outcome could be decided even earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="27">October 31, the court decided to recognize the invalid certificate of registration &quot;Rosbalt,&quot; effectively blocking the agency status of the media.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This is not to say that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; during the standoff remained alone.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (a statement in the name of Roscomnadzor head Alexander Jaroff on October 10 signed the 26 deputies; the document was filed on the initiative of the Communist Party).</seg>
		<seg id="30">About the closure of the magazine stated that the head of Russia's Journalists Union Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov.</seg>

		<seg id="4">However, Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the potential economic benefits of freer movements in the rest of Europe, although it is predictable - it's not appeared in headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">No one has also pointed out that EU member countries spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as it is convenient for them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Because Scotland is not included in the Schengen area continued non-compliance requirements will be a cheap concession for Brussels in return what he really wanted from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So it's not interesting story.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And so old that it has turned into a fossil: The first time I heard &quot;duck&quot; that &quot;independence means passport control&quot; at least 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the paraphrase of ancient tales.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why did an independent Scotland must execute orders in Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here is a real European news: The great postwar plan to unite Europe finally has stalled.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The eurocrisis project &quot;Europe&quot; is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Across the European Union parties opposed the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a common currency, gaining strength.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany &quot;- based only this year - appeared out of nowhere and has received almost five million votes in the September federal election, thus essentially replacing the&quot; Free Democrats &quot;(the equivalent of our&quot; Liberal Democrats &quot;) from the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There was always the internal opposition to the plan of a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on the national economy through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to believe that the project &quot;Europe&quot; gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits, &quot;it was true only for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Actually system blocked its members on exchange rates, favorable for German exporters, &quot;that German politicians and want to preserve.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in pre-production capability disadvantage in comparison with Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only means of salvation is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the current budget problems and the currency is a deeper problem of the productive capacity of Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of measures to &quot;green&quot; energy introduced Brussels, is a cipher for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, &quot;the European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This paralyze adverse price terms, as we have seen in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">No freezing salaries in the world does not stop the overwhelming victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result, the revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the most ardent that she was a EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite is viewed by the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a level with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy, Europe, leaving the ruined economy of France in distress.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result is a right-wing, anti-EU party serving Marine Le Pen's National Front &quot;has just won a decisive election, throwing the ruling Socialist party into third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;The Front&quot; is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labor that cannot proceed from the assumption that the rift among the right would automatically in favor of the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If - and this is very likely - against pro-EU parties will receive support in this election, such a bloc will first take a dominant position in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">That's my opinion: Soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are fused together to destroy the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but he again will become something of a vague &quot;Europe (sovereign) nations&quot; who liked General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and several dependent on her economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe to restore their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I suppose that Britain refrains from this project, hoping to move closer to the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific points to the likelihood that Britain will remain unaddressed in the cold Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In what position it leaves Scotland?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to become the region (in fact) Little England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to throw.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland could succeed in the framework of freer European agreement provided that we will keep its currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier to federal Europe nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is - oddly enough - the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures that have provoked a formidable majority in 2011 due to objections against the spending cuts proposed (and implemented) Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Aleister Darling and subsequently seduced by the coalition of the Tories and the Liberal Democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Scotland now it would be ridiculous to vote for independence, only to accept the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: Aging earlier</seg>
		<seg id="1">African and Latin American girls usually reach puberty earlier than their white survey, the research shows.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The physical changes do not mean that puberty close</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that blame hormones or other chemicals</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the launch mechanisms of early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is not as expressed in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Should the mother frightened if her daughter are beginning to form the beginnings of breast cancer and pubic hairs to grow at 7 or 8 years old?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, a pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time, calming parents - usually does not mean the rapid onset of puberty,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Evident signs of development, such as growing breasts, love and muscle hair and body odor, appear before the girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But it was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and declined compared with 12,75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;After the chest begins to develop, is at least two to three years before the march,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also is the author of the book &quot;Early puberty in girls: How to deal with this widespread problem.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will prosper.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The debate about what constitutes an actual onset of puberty, but is considered &quot;premature&quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in the growth of up to 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process will slow or fizzle is what the pediatrician can monitor carefully.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A more rapid progression can serve as a basis for tests at endocrinologist to exclude the serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are procedures to detain the early menstruation and prevent another consequence: Premature aging bones, which ultimately could lead to slower growth and lower growth in adulthood.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz cautious with drugs, but admits that &quot;the suppression of puberty may soften behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">Another big problem is clear: Parents simply do not want to do their very young daughters were menstruation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or even about how they cope with health issues,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman, the daughter of menstruation which began in 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She came home from school fearful and upset by the fact that she was the first among his friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are a lot of muchheralded theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The boys - like girls, puberty comes earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz argues that the premise, which has the greatest weight, is an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years old, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the terms of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country of African-American and Latin American girls usually reach puberty earlier than their white survey.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Around the world in the early puberty apparently affects everything from economic conditions and change to the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another mystery: Although the boys pubic hair on the face and to appear at younger ages, the tendency to complete early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors involved in the conference, AAP, confirmed the complexity of this theme.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The emergence of pimples and pubic hair found even in infants and a toddler.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital in Goryeb Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;It may mean an earlier than expected, the conversation,&quot; explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you keep calm, your child usually respond well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Devices that bloom early, you need to confirm that even when it happens early, this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, the daily turnover of which is $5.3 trillion.</seg>
		<seg id="3">These two trader will be the first by the RBS, suspended during the unfolding investigation, which dovetails with scandal involving manipulation of the interbank rate LIBOR.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Case comment on suspension, the bank confirmed that this month he had received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;Our current investigation of this issue continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,&quot; he said at the bank two weeks ago.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Last month, the knowledgeable person said that RBS gave the records of e-mail and instant messages, which received and sent his former trader, Britain's regulatory authority - the Office for control of financial activities (FCA).</seg>
		<seg id="7">This trader, Richard Asher, resigned from RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, he was given a vacation at his current post as head of the European spot of currency trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was removed from the Standard Chartered Bank this week.</seg>
		<seg id="9">None of these traders have not been accused of any violations.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The group IM contacts Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The bank UBS announced this week that he has taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator FINMA said that he was investigating alleged manipulation in the currency market in several Swiss banks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At least six regulatory bodies in the world - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss agency Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice, the US and Hong Kong value management is considering allegations that bankers are engaged in a conspiracy to impact on the currency market.</seg>
		<seg id="13">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal audits or have received requests for information from regulators, said a person familiar with the situation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Banks through instant messages and e-mails for several years in search of cases of offences.</seg>
		<seg id="15">News about the checks roused the traders in the sphere of activities that were in recent years, one of the largest sources of income trading divisions of the investment banks, which this year, however, faced difficulties because low currency volatility reduces the opportunities for buyers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation, saying that the extensive and liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that it is not always true.</seg>
		<seg id="17">According to the senior trader, despite the huge amount of daily trades in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use of the bank's internal platforms means that &quot;you can begin to exert influence on the market for a very small price.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">This news came on the same day, when the bank Credit Suisse announced that fired one of the traders of the stock trading department of the London Stock Exchange this week, after he caused losses amounting to almost 6 million dollars at the end of last year.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with regulators.</seg>

		<seg id="1">John Kerry demonstrated the mitigation of the tactics of the protection of the U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented recognition that in some cases, the US espionage &quot;debate gone far.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The secretary also acknowledged that the guilty, along with Barack Obama, that was &quot;on autopilot&quot; during the high-profile appearance of Edward J. Snowden revelations about NSA spying activities.</seg>
		<seg id="3">These leaks of information put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Speaking via video link on the open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: &quot;There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government actually took some things happening on autopilot, because such a possibility already existed - and during the Second World War, and in a very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, on September 11.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Then he became the first senior member of the U.S. government to recognize that the US espionage went too far, but stressed that affect the rights were not violated.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;In some cases, it debate went far.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And the president is determined to shed light on the issue and communicate to the people, and now holds a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has the feeling of abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I assure you, abuse of innocent people in this process is not present. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good intentions and that its tracking operation saved many lives.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: &quot;We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow himself.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the world there is a radical extremism, reckless and full determination to kill people, blow people and attack on the government.</seg>
		<seg id="12">And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We actually prevent the collapse of planes, the explosions of buildings and killing people, because we were able to find out about these plans in advance. &quot;</seg>

		<seg id="16">&quot;For the national security interests of the United States is really important that the Europeans were our supporters against our common anti-terrorist efforts,&quot; said Democrat Murphy, working in office the first time and is the chairman of the Senate foreign relations subcommittee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;And I go to Europe to give them to understand that we must continue to cooperate in fighting terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">News that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, worsened relations with some allies of the United States, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflect misunderstanding of the metadata that collected the NATO allies and which they shared with the United States.</seg>

		<seg id="22">The names of the other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">According to him, the program of the trip is still at the stage of development.</seg>
		<seg id="24">While Murphy said that the purpose of the trip is to promote the improvement of relations, he said that some degree of hardness, &quot;meaning&quot; will also be manifested.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He said that European leaders must be honest with his people in which spyware programs they have used for many years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;While we can change our tracking program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who engaged in intelligence activities,&quot; said Murphy.</seg>

		<seg id="2">&quot;My husband and I just bought a house, so that all my money is invested there,&quot; says Ms. Amirthalinga.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although she and earns S $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia - where the volume of household debt is growing - is that ValueMax, where she conducts its deal, this week became the third Lombard registered on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Credit on bail jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Usually, pawnbrokers in Singapore, there are an effective annual interest rate of 17% - just above the 15.4% offered in the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a subsidiary in the same shopping center.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, the pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or evidence of wages and can lend faster than banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Therefore, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers, because families are feeling the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of sustained growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap loans, pitated loose monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and middle-income countries are turning to pawnbrokers to offset the decline in revenues as the slow growth of their economies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week, the Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, has indicated an increase in household leverage, mainly due to the growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, compared with 60% in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists is also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely got out of technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The bottom line is that with the rise in prices, people in the middle and bottom of the income scale [] will look for ways to supplement their incomes where only able to,&quot; said Song Seng wun, CIMB economist, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Record high gold prices in the past two years, exacerbated the haste with which people are pawning their personal belongings, because they are using the opportunity to get money for their family jewels.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore, about 70% of the items contained in 200 Lombard points, the city-state, are gold products.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People say: &quot;The price of gold looks good, let's lay a gold chain of grandmothers and get it back in the next month.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops EasyMoney observed an increase in the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Growth in Lombard business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the department in Bandera and 15 others, such as in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where he has four stores, but also outside Asia, too, says Jean Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will finance the expansion, with 60 percent of the S $66 million raised this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some lenders have caused the fire of criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeoh says that a stigma not only offers cheaper rates than other creditors, he also does not increase the debt directly.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Clients are pawning items that they already possess, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households,&quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Clad becoming increasingly widespread public recognition as a means to get the short-term, secured financing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">And while Lombardi are not only those categories of people who are in dire financial straits.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Rich people in Singapore also use the offices of ValueMax, laying the gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see clients from all walks of life.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses, which need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,&quot; says Ms. Yeah.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box you in the car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">While the American road designers are trying to find the money for the repair of highways dispages system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box, neatly restroom on the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">These devices, tracking every proezjaemuu automobilist mile and transmit this information to officials, are located in the center of the controversial attempts to modernize an outdated system of financing America's highways, undertaken routine bodies of Washington and Oregon.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Usually the boring arena of planning highways suddenly has generated intense debate and rich alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying the government for the right to use compact drawers to track the number of miles you proezjaemyh and even, perhaps, where you pass them, &quot;and then use this information in tax bills.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The movement of tea in shock.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Liberties Union also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about the private life.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And although until Congress cannot agree to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They ponder how during the next decade, you can go to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of road, which they can ride.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists have already taken for testing of these black boxes, some of which have the function of satellite tracking.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is really necessary for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;This is not a question that we may be the right choice,&quot; said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is preparing plans for the beginning of the state authorities tracking miles, proezjaemyh every Californian automobilist, by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technologies for this already.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The necessity of this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Governing Foundation for the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay at the petrol stations.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Americans already not buy as much gasoline as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars travelling more miles per gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not appreciated for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians do not want to raise the tax even for one penny at high prices for gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;Tax on gasoline is simply impossible to save,&quot; said Li Mann, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In his state of the cars was recently installed on 500 tracking devices for testing poll payment system.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;It would be the best option in the long term,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And call it pile user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is no wonder that this idea attracts urban liberals, because using taxes will change the nature of the trips to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Routine bodies in California look at this system during the development of strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to fight global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House transportation committee, said that he, too, sees this system as the most viable long-term alternatives.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Proponents free market to fund &quot;Reason&quot; also delighted from what will force drivers to pay for each mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;It's not just a tax that will go into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of Political Affairs Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People directly pay for what they get.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This movement is also supported by two former ministers of transport in the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of poll payment.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The US Senate approved a pilot project last year worth 90 million dollars, which would be attended by about 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of fears of rural lawmakers representing the voters who in everyday life often have to come a lot of miles to get to work or to the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several states and cities, nevertheless, are on the way.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The greatest enthusiasm is manifested in Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country claimed 5,000 drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon be paying state for the mile run instead of tax on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Nevada pilot project has already been completed.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In New York, he is.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois probe it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">A coalition of I-95, which includes transportation departments of 17 East Coast states, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they will be able to carry out these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This concept has not received universal recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can track their every step.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about the&quot; big brother &quot;and similar things is a big problem,&quot; said Allauddin Khan, head of the issues of strategy and management at the Department of Transport Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It was not what people wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When the tests were underway, a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its Web site: &quot;It will be difficult to turn these devices into a full-fledged tracking devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure that will inevitably grow to store records about everyday movements of individual citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of the few states where difficult search for inexpensive technology that would have allowed the state authorities to allow proezjaemyh car miles, but without the information about the place and time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you can do it, said Khan, the society will feel more relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The search for this technology have led some state agencies to a young company in California called True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Initially, the company is not engaged in promoting to collect state taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She sought to enter the growing market of automobile insurance, in which drivers are paid on the basis of mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the device, which it tests, attract designers roads because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloadable via modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People will be more inclined to do it, if you do not track their speed and do not track their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">There were several big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There is much less expensive and less hypes ways to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon designers are experimenting with providing drivers of the various options.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose the device with or without a GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee, based on the average number of miles that can ride all the residents of the state.</seg>
		<seg id="57">In other places, are hoping to sell the idea of a careful public, forcing the device to do more, not less.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York, transportation officials are keen to develop nalogooblagaugee device that will also take charge for parking enumerators, to provide &quot;pay as going&quot; insurance and collect data about the speed of the pool in real-time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Automobilists will involve the benefits that they will offer,&quot; says the document urban design.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some designers transport systems, however, think about is not whether all the talk of poll paying just a huge distraction.</seg>
		<seg id="61">In the urban transport commission in the San Francisco Bay area officials say that Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy trustee of the Fund for the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Extra-time or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, so that they pay their fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when all you have to do is to take aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on legislation and public relations.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life and many other things.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Pope Francis named the first cardinals in February</seg>
		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will raise the dignity of the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in terms of his service on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Cardinals are senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and it is they who elect popes, so Francis will appoint its first group of people who eventually will be involved in choosing his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Currently, there are 201 Cardinal.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, after reaching the Cardinal 80 years of age, he can no longer take part in the election of Pope is the prerogative of a group of 120 &quot;Cardinals-electors.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony will be held in construction of a meeting of all current cardinals, known as consistory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis decided to pre-announce its decision to convene the Consistory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; Lombardi said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero from the organization of the &quot;Catholic vote,&quot; said that by February, the number of cardinals electors are likely to recede.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He said that the pope usually refers to as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals electors-up to 120, as well as so many cardinals over the age of 80 years as he chooses.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Consistory next year will be of great significance because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the moment there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In South America, home to 40 percent of Catholics, but they are insignificant number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It will also be the first chosen by cardinals since the formation of the Council of Cardinals Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, which is to seek ways of reforming the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past, the pope all decided independently.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now, Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He said that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis will turn to considers for advice.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But we have not been in this situation before - all this is the first time for us.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said that dads are usually built into the office of Cardinal Bishops from large parishes, but Francis &quot;is full of surprises - so we do not know whom he cites.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Treasury has carried out a preliminary evaluation measures on capital gains tax, but expects a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced the state tax rate of 7% for homes worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership, not as individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="2">At this point, the state duty of homes in areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, who constituted 708 million pounds in the 2012 / 13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humber taken together.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Mr Cook said: &quot;After the increase in expenses on expensive homes and the introduction of related laws against evasion is very hard to argue that the taxation of expensive properties is undervalued, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;But this step could lead to the fact that some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners do not want to sell it,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The cost of a first-class property - the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price - in the rich south-west London belt that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose to a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>

		<seg id="1">According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton's candidacy in the electoral list of 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This discovery is the most vivid sensation of all the expected book by Mark Galperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 campaign &quot;doubled bets: The game has changed 2012.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">The publication of The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported on Thursday night that the president's close aides held a &quot;large-scale studies in focus groups and polls at the end of 2011,&quot; to assess whether the exclusion of Biden to help raise the declining hopes for Obama's re-election.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to The Times political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts of high-ranking officials of the campaign staff and the White House, namely the former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to estimate what the effect will vote on the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton vice president.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in Chicago election headquarters and in the Oval Office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only six of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, the former head of Obama's campaign staff Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that the replacement is considered.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The book &quot;bets doubled,&quot; argues that Daley was the initiator attempts to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal relationship&quot; but eventually withdrew from this step when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral list does not &quot;significantly improve the chances of Obama.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration really considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I actively advocated the examination of many things, and this was one of them,&quot; he told the Daily newspaper.</seg>
		<seg id="10">You must remember that at the moment, the president was in terrible shape, so we thought: &quot;Oh God, what can we do?&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Russian brewers bad mood.</seg>
		<seg id="2">They calculated that beer consumption in the country in the next year will remain at the same level, and it is at best.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although the businessmen initially counted on growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For the current year is unfortunate for them: Sales fell by 7 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="5">About all this told the head of one of the largest beer companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian brewers Isaac Sheps at the 3rd Annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute &quot;goods FMCG in Russia,&quot; which just ended in Moscow.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It discussed the state regulation of the market.</seg>
		<seg id="7">From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 percent, because in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in part of the production and sales of beer is the drink with a small amounts of alcohol, &quot;said Scheps listeners.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In no country in the world, there is no such tight restrictions on the beer market, unpredictable introducing more and more illogical taboos that bones allegedly struggle with alcohol abuse.</seg>

		<seg id="15">To preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to go from varieties, calculated on the consumer, in the class of &quot;premium&quot;: The beer will be less, but it will be worth more.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Why would the construction of the TPU in Moscow</seg>
		<seg id="1">Every year the city authorities promised to arrange more shipping centers (TPU).</seg>
		<seg id="2">Until 2020, is scheduled to enter into operation 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What actually turns the project, our correspondent sorting.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A couple of months ago at the station &quot;Smolensk&quot; Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line was a construction fence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The caption read that goes the resettlement project.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It was very strange, because next to the &quot;Smolensk&quot; no land transport does not stop and, therefore, you cannot change to him.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To get to the nearest bus stop on the Garden Ring, one must overcome about 130 meters, including land transition through Carmanita lane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For now, &quot;Smolensk&quot; almost all over.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Ices flower stall, demolished booth for newspapers, and asphalt before entering cobblestone changed.</seg>
		<seg id="10">That is the whole hub.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Transport and self-service transfer nodes are plane and capital, &quot;explained at the press service of the Department of Transport.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Capital TPU is not present.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And planar require the construction of parking, the withdrawal of trade objects that could hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and accomplishment.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Actually, the plane TPU even do not transporters and professional blagoustroiteli overhaul of the department of the city of Moscow.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hub is not necessarily complicated structure, &quot;explains the director of the Institute of Economics of transport and transport policies of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Sometimes a roof over their heads and the scoreboard, operate about the time of arrival of transport.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here, for example, the station &quot;lamps&quot; recently opened a full-fledged 12.00PM. highlight the node.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Let without canopies, but with purchasess car parks and the scoreboard, indicating when the bus will come.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But in the pursuit of a number of officials recorded at TPU everything.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Back in 2011, the city planned to build on all about all 151 node, 59 of them with capital construction.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Now the plans until 2020 are up to 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Of these, 150 promise to pass more this year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Although the city has TPU development program, has not indicated any qualitative criteria, &quot;stated Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization&quot; City and transport. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="24">Accounts by the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Criteria, according to the expert, should be two: The first is to reduce the time of the transplant, the second - convenience.</seg>
		<seg id="26">First of all, the opportunity to change the mode of transport, not going under the rain.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Moscow, the same arrangement of the TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A clear example of the station &quot;Achievements.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="29">Previously, commuter buses with Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the fairgrounds.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Now their stops moved on the opposite side of the Cosmonaut Yaroslavsky on the street.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Farther from the metro, much farther from monorails, but closer to residential buildings.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Freely that residents do not want to bus station under the windows and complained in every possible instance.</seg>
		<seg id="33">With the capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately bring us happiness.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The first of them began to build five years ago at the station &quot;Planner.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="35">The project was designed to be a model.</seg>
		<seg id="36">And, indeed, is a sample of how 12.00PM. node, dan to investors, turns into a banal shopping mall.</seg>
		<seg id="37">No, there is a person for buses, shed not to go on the subway in the rain, and three floors of the parking lots.</seg>
		<seg id="38">True, Khimkinsky trolleybus No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow TPU places are not given fundamentally.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Their as others pushed away from the station.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But the space under the trade more left.</seg>
		<seg id="41">One only 32 clothing shop, but in general, there is almost everything - from pet products to the showroom.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Well, in fact, suddenly somebody from the bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road?</seg>
		<seg id="43">We have to build major TPU, somehow always get a shopping mall.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion when part of the car parks decided to give at the market.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Now, on the third floor of the TPU &quot;Planner&quot; among the marked on the floor parking spaces travelling.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, Russian speech and security guards, angrily Polding on our photographer.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Reading knot finally turned into a bazaar.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The thing is that before the station &quot;Planner&quot; was a market, but he was demolished.</seg>
		<seg id="49">And in the prefecture traders regretted and allowed the purchasesin parking project.</seg>
		<seg id="50">All the same because of the high prices, there is always empty.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The same funny that the market is demolished to build in its place... a new TPU highlight.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Such rocks.</seg>
		<seg id="53">The Kaluzhskaya metro distance approach from the lobby to the bus station was 50 meters, &quot;said Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="54">After the construction of a shopping center, ostensibly TPU, the distance has risen to 170 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="55">To get on a bus, you must go through the whole mall.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After 22 hours, when it is closed, must work around him under the open sky.</seg>
		<seg id="57">However, the structure of the &quot;Plane&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot; will soon be showing the neck.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In mid-September gradostroitelno-Land Commission City Council approved the planning decisions for the first eight TPU capital.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Four of them will be 25-stage, not counting the two or three underground floors.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The main monster will grow at the station &quot;Ring,&quot; there will be 418,7 thousand square meters of space.</seg>
		<seg id="61">Representatives of the Russian Railways Directorate railway stations, responsible for the construction of the subway at TPU, has already told reporters: In future etc will contain shops, hotels and apartments.</seg>
		<seg id="62">The officials argue that the parking bay Zai ­ Mut from a third to a half of the area.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Take, for example, &quot;folk&quot; garages.</seg>
		<seg id="64">For example, a garage for 258 machine-seats, who recently built on the street, has an area of 8015 square meters.</seg>
		<seg id="65">So, for parking at 2.6 thousand cars in the &quot;Petrovsko-Razumovsky&quot; will need about 80 thousand &quot;squares.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="66">This is less than a third of the machines that there are going to build.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Let the one-two floors will go on various persons for buses.</seg>
		<seg id="68">It remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="69">And that, at the minute, almost two GUM.</seg>
		<seg id="70">If the capital TPU at stations and railway stations build railway workers, then the rest of the site will develop metropolitans.</seg>
		<seg id="71">They also promised that there will be a lot of &quot;functional destination&quot; objects, including hotels, offices and even sports halls.</seg>
		<seg id="72">By the way, in the department of property in the city of Moscow, recently told reporters that develop a draft decree, according to which investors can apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Without competitions.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Therefore, they say that transportation issues for the city is a priority.</seg>
		<seg id="75">The ideal TPU is, for example, the &quot;Harvard&quot; in Boston, or &quot;Spadina&quot; in Toronto, &quot;says Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="76">There the trolleys and streetcars descend underground at the level of the subway and the distance approach from the train station to the tram is only 50 metres without entering into the street.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Around no unnecessary trade.</seg>
		<seg id="78">But Moscow officials throws in the extremes.</seg>
		<seg id="79">Either we will build nothing, or too the 25 floors with offices and apartments.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Corporation Bombardier, the Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, reported on Thursday that net profit by 15 percent under the influence of minimised number of orders and deliveries of planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Located in the Montreal company Bombardier also has not released any data for flight testing of its new CSeries aircraft aircraft and has not provided new information about whether made ambitious plans to introduce the plane into commercial operation by next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the first flight prototype aircraft held about one and a half months ago, he was still only three times, which raises questions about whether the testing stage on schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results did not meet forecasts and led to a fall in the shares of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its estimate on Thursday with &quot;above moves&quot; to &quot;moves&quot; because of the belief that the growth of the shares is limited in the next quarter or two.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;While the decrease in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the performance of the profits of the transport department,&quot; said Derksen in the review of the stock market.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries aircraft as the continuation of the flight test program.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Nevertheless, if not in the coming months will be announced on new orders, we assume that the market will become more skeptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The company Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will allow her to win a seat in the lower price segment of the market, where it is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March, and for the first time, made a flying in September after several months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However, the firm orders for the CSeries aircraft so far, not too much - 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to check the company's statements about fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new airliner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There are currently has 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">CEO Pierre Beaudoin, was confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders at the time when the first plane will be put into commercial operation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test model of the plane had not stayed on the ground longer than expected,&quot; Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that at the time of the aircraft were scheduled ground tests and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">All manufacturers plan to test in different ways.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We decided to spend the first flight and make a break for the upgrade, so we did.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So will occur during the entire flight test program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test samples must take a flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow him, as reported by the company.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Yet analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first client could begin to the exploitation of the CSeries aircraft plane through 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company Bombardier said that it assesses the commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slow pace of flight tests - though apparently and corresponds to the domestic schedule Bombardier - reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015,&quot; said Derksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter, concided on September 30, Bombardier net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Gross income fell slightly, from $4.2 percent to $4.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer announced that he has put 45 aircraft for the quarter, less than the average for the previous year - 57.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26 planes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The portfolio of aerospace department orders totaled $32.9 billion at September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In the aerospace field results consistent with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become unpleasant factor,&quot; Beaudoin said.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Gross income on cosmic direction fell by 13 percent - up to $2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest producer of trains, reported that gross income in this sector grew by almost 11 percent, to $2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The portfolio of orders in the transport division totaled $32.6 billion at September 30, which is a little higher than on December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In the transport division revenues negatively affected the problems with the execution of several large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Management said that in the fourth quarter will be presented a new development plan.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Shares of the company Bombardier, which also announced that Google's chief financial officer, Patrick Pichette enters the Board of Directors, fell by 8.5 percent to C $4,83 at auction in mid-Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker and the nearest rival, Bombardier, reported on Thursday to reduce its quarterly income by 10 percent.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Two YMCA employee accused of sexual crimes before the accusations against Jonathan Lord, it became known as the Royal Commission</seg>
		<seg id="1">Two members of the YMCA NSW were accused of sexual crimes against children before the allegations in 2011 against the employee institutions to care for children in Caringbah Jonathan Lord, said the Royal Commission on sexual violence against children.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But in an opening statement, the commission was told that she &quot;never had a case with cases of sexual violence against children within their organization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Leading executive director Philip Hair asked about one case when the YMCA worker was charged with crimes related to child pornography, and about another case, when the gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sex crimes against children under his supervision, in 1991.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mr. Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer, the commission aid provider that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He admitted that the YMCA in opening remarks to the commission also made a mistake, arguing that &quot;there were external verification of the YMCA, pressed that YMCA is at the forefront to ensure the safety of children.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Commission, the evidence suggests that YMCA was notified that she received the second-lowest of the four possible ratings on the results of the audit quality, performed by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21 years, admitted that he and nijestoyaschee leadership made a fault-Lord, and also failed to provide a clear understanding of the staff of its obligations regarding reports of violations of children's security policy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys within two years of his work at the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was imprisoned for at least six years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Mr. Hair rejected the suggestion that the corporate ethics YMCA prevented the employees to report violations of the Lord in the safety of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The employees testified that they saw violations, including what the Lord was alone with children, personally courting them, throw them on your knees, said that he likes to one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Daniel Ockwell, which was under the leadership of the Lord and asked to teach its protection of children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that he found Jackie Barnett, manager of children of the branch of the YMCA in Caringbah, who was the head of the Lord, &quot;a very frightening and often inaccessible.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanation of the employees that they were embarrassed to report the situation to its senior management.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord him them from the thought of having to tell about it.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hare said that he presented to the Board of the YMCA New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization of the &quot;incident with Jonathan Lord,&quot; not &quot;concerns the provision of information&quot; on the part of employees, and the council agreed with him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr. Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign a confidentiality agreement shortly after the emergence of the accusations was made by the Director General of the YMCA of children getting Wheatley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said that it was intended to prevent the damage of evidence, but &quot;reinserted&quot; and this decision poorly implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="18">YMCA of the New South Wales was not safe for children of the organization during the work of Jonathan Lord in the period 2009-2011, the commission said the expert on the problems of abused children, Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University.</seg>

		<seg id="1">We can safely say that New York is a place of birth standup-comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, the amateur artist Frank Fay, who worked in the theater Masters Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in colloquial manner.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Created and overseen Caroline Hirsch, founder standup-club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, counting more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Most of these headline started at Carolines, and then achieved more success, have reached a level when they are already too famous to perform at the club,&quot; said Hirsh.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have created this festival as a way to continue to work with them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This year's event includes performances by Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as &quot;stands for heroes&quot; - an annual musical-comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square-garden, where will appear among other Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With the expansion of the festival expanded and the world of comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">A few comedians participating in the festival this year, gained popularity unconventional by, for example, thanks to the show on a small television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.</seg>

		<seg id="10">Jenny Slate joined the cast as a &quot;bat night live&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreations&quot;, although most of all it is known for a series of viral videos, &quot;Marcel - mussel in boots.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">And Diana, and Slate, like other young comedians with a distinctive style (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, evil, focused on racial themes Kamau Bell), is the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One of the highlights of the festival will become whom David's interview with Larry David.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Steinberg started as standup-comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in the movies, as well as the unofficial historian comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="14">From 2005 to 2007, he was the leading show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The meeting will be held in the hall of the Town Hall in Midtown Manhattan.</seg>
