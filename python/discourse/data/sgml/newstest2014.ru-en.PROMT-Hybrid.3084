		<seg id="6">Prosecutors demanded a life sentence while they could insist that the person nicknamed &quot;demolition man&quot; for the reputation of the master in the production of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This decision compounded painful memories of the mother from Perth with the June Cortina who lost the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny from the terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly ten years ago.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In the old times becoming accustomed to the yard of storks, peasants to the high column set the wheels from a cart and heavy nest is good on it saved.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Such special support are not set for a long time so storks chose columns of power lines - bound industries rely on wires thanks to what the aistiny settle costs reliably.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The grandmother Anya near which house in the village of Ivanovka of petrikov area years twenty there lives the aistiny family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite the efforts of its residents.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Birds put top new industries, and the bottom layer already gave between wires, is on the verge of collapse.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Of course, it is a pity for seven storks who clustered each year, at the metochion, removed and raised for the summer of three to four chicks, but there is no wish to remain without electricity.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As soon as birds flew to warm regions, the grandmother Anya convened in Tsarichansky RES, which has the support.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And did not even expect that there would react so quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="8">When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest in general still remains - the technical director of DTEK &quot;Dneprooblenergo&quot; Sergei Berezovsky said.</seg>
		<seg id="9">On the wires that turned out, in fact, already in the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kg corrosive began.</seg>

		<seg id="16">To begin estimated that in the area in an emergency state there are more than 50 aistiny &quot;apartments&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For their renovation, the special metal platforms recalling the crater were welded.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The base is knotted willow branches, and then transferred old nest there.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to experts, it is enough to lay old industries as the basis that birds have learned a nest and returned to it.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Already then storks will complete housing.</seg>
		<seg id="21">A month ago in the village of the eel of the novomoskovsky area, the first nest was reconstructed.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Near the electrosupport put a new reinforced concrete column and has posted a platform with the old, has inhabited nest.</seg>

		<seg id="30">Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - locals fed them and did not offend.</seg>
		<seg id="31">When villagers, hearing gunshots, ran to the pond, four handsome swans already pipe-borne water the dead.</seg>

		<seg id="6">A lawyer who nicknamed the Bash and nicknamed among criminals &quot;a cool lawyer&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 after police operation on surveillance Scarborough of which he represented in the court related to drugs earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Officers noticed how 32-year Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at the house of a lawyer in the town of Blackburn of the County of Lancashire, while that was at the dinner of the bar association with colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The investigation revealed that Ditta &quot;regularly used&quot; class A drug after tests showed trace amounts of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Within eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to get illegally information on arrests of two people at the request of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All four suspects were under surveillance as part of a widespread investigating criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire and Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire at the time.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They and 32 more persons were imprisoned later after the police withdrew during a series of raids heroin and cocaine for the sum of £1.5 million and also more than £200 thousand cash.</seg>
		<seg id="12">42-year-old Ditta said information to criminals because of fear that his cocaine dependence will be disclosed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today in the Liverpool royal court of Ditt which works in a law firm of Forbes Solicitors, which is in Blackburn it was disgraced after recognition of his guilt in two cases of alleged obstruction of justice following the results of a three-week court in the Liverpool Court of the crown.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He admitted storage of cocaine at a previous court sessions.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Exposure of a lawyer happened after police investigating the activities of Scarborough discovered that he regularly spoke from Ditt by telephone from February 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two detectives traced the suspect and establish how he approached Ditt's house in Blackburn and posted drugs, 60 per cent purity in a black glove for golf under waste bins of counsel.</seg>

		<seg id="19">The court learned that Ditta &quot;regularly took&quot; cocaine after tests found class A drug traces in his hair, a purse and on their credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta was arrested later, however denied the cocaine use, told that talked to the suspected dealer as that was his client, and insisted that their communication is &quot;lawyer secret&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the detention of Ditt took the wallet and tried to take out some credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, the pattern of hair was also taken from it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For questioning by police he said that, along with the workplace, he has both a home office, and clients came to her home on legal affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The court, however, knew that after important arrests it called the largest contributors to drug trafficking, which number he represented in court earlier to say that detectives know about them.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In an angry speech of Anne White said: &quot;If someone is also aware that it is not necessary to break the law, this is a criminal lawyer&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing its position of the criminal lawyer as he entered too close relationship with certain clients.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Contact that we are talking about — that is not simply a drug dealer, and the drug dealer supply of medication for their own lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of his talk will certainly be lawful, as he was their lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But it largely has exceeded the limits of the normal relations of the lawyer and his client.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It had intervened with the police investigation as hard as you can allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr. Ditta did not honour their profession, and disgraced it.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He, too, came up with certain clients, in particular Scarborough and allowed to question the lack of interest.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta did not admit guilt and said: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer whom I am not and would like to pass information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, I would make it immediately&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after the meeting, the senior officer Lee Halstead by police in Lancashire said: &quot;Mr. Ditta turned from the criminal lawyer into the criminal had just begun to getting drugs at organized crime figures&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="34">His addiction to cocaine has made it hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main actors in criminal groups who requested it to gain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Lawyers should follow the highest standards of ethics and inspire in society trust and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Mr. Ditta betrayed the trust and tried to be met with the profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Investigations into the case of Mr. Ditt conducted division of Lancashire on particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already made it a sentence in three cases of storage of cocaine, and now also on obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve just punishment for offenders.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Let this case will serve as a warning to criminals that no one is out of reach of law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and we will bring to justice.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Producers of jets are at war on seat width, when on the game large orders</seg>
		<seg id="1">Among the leading manufacturers of planes fierce dispute regarding the width of the seats of a tourist-class on long-range missions erupted, setting the tone for the violent confrontation at the Dubai aviation exhibition this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute is fostering round the width of the seats, provided on long-haul flights to passengers of the economy class, whose interests are not always the focus of airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the statements about the effectiveness of the last aircraft proposed Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for the implementation of the industry standard that would provide a seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in salons of economy class, but her main American competitor to Boeing said that airlines must solve it.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute goes when aircraft manufacturers compete on sales of more and more large versions of the twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and on the effects potentially record orders are expected from 17 to 21 November.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Configuration of the rear of the plane — especially whether 9 or 10 people in a row sit — is central to the alleged economic efficiency of new projects &quot;mini-airbuses&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accomodate 20,687 people based on seats in economy class more than 17 inch in width posted on 10 in each row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport in economy class of 350 people on the seats 18 inches wide rowed on 9.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Giants in aircraft construction often exchange blows to technical issues through advertising in the professional press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And now Airbus addresses directly to the public before an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It did recently as may be the beginning of new advertising war, demonstrating to financiers a slide from three people in the restaurant next to each other under the name &quot;would You agree to it? &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing proposals long-haul flights on seats of narrower than at the regional turboprop aircraft&quot; — head of the sales of Airbus John Leahy said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">With changing diets people gain weight, but plane seats dramatically has not changed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Among the early 1970s when wide-body Boeing 747 set standards of modern distant travel, and the turn of the century the weight of the average American man aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the Department of Health of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The grasp of the waist of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the health service of the US.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus claims that her competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s when the average grasp of the waist of those who were named by &quot;jet public&quot; recently, was already.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus said that commissioned a study showing that the additional inch in width of the seat improves the quality of sleep for 53 per cent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing challenges Airbus figures by the size of seats and said that producers should not interfere with decisions on how to airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.</seg>
		<seg id="18">According to her, studies show that ease of salon depends not only on seat width.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It's actually is limited to providing to airlines choice and the ability to do that in their view they should make for success&quot; — an expert from Boeing in salons Kent Kreyver said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They don't want that we decided to them, which will do for them profit.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, the issue is to increase in space on each side, but for suppliers, they tend to be a factor that may affect the profits.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind this dispute there is a race for orders for aircraft evaluated on at least $700 billion at the catalogue prices in the coming decades — there is enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As for the first reported in July, Reuters news agency, the location of seats — him that stirs up rivalry in the fight between the latest jets.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing declare 20 per cent increase in profitability in one place in their latest twin-engine long-haul models in comparison with the market leader in this segment, 365-seater Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The alleged characteristics of Boeing are partly based on comparison of 10-seater ranks 777X with original 9-seater configuration of ranks a constructive solution 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The prize in specific prime cost declines when compared with 10-seater configuration, currently in use.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;The reason why Boeing does it, is to compressive more seats and make the aircraft more competitive compared with our development&quot; — Kevin Keniston, head of the department of comfort for passengers of Airbus in Europe said.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, analysts say parlours with complete 10-seater series for existing the 777th indicate that many passengers prefer dense seating arrangements that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Seats eighteen inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is caused by the threat from the 777th model&quot; — a specialist in the interior of the passenger compartment Mary Kirby, the founder and WFP Girl Network editor said.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing do not deliver a chair, but offer a catalogue of vendors from that airlines can choose.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The sellers of jets traveling the world even carry with them roulettes to check the competing lay-out.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Extolling comfort, all manufacturers also offer planes with very dense configuration of salon for budget airlines and regional flights.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus proposals A350 with 10-seater ranks, but said that it still did not sell it.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional modifications of salons, offering broader places when passing on some of the planes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern planes as experts say, her appeal to a new industry standard &quot;will hardly&quot; take off &quot;but can divert attention from a wave of sales of the model 777X.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The concern about security in Mozambique increases due to a conflict of influential people</seg>
		<seg id="1">Under Zamora Machel statue looking at them from top to bottom, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the Maputo centre to chant slogans on the world at a demonstration, rare here.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want the return of the world; we want stability &quot;— Vanessa said de Sousse, executive director of investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Fearing for the future of the country, it replaced a business suit with the t-shirt adorned with an inscription &quot;We require security&quot; in Portuguese, and joined on Thursday the crowd at capital Square of Independence.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Within two weeks almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo came — these are one of the most brutal clashes since a truce over 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once known rebel movement, which was supported at first by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then the government of the apartheid era of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After the armistice of 1992, it is the opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts believe that the country hardly will again come down to a full-scale conflict, but recent events forced to be fidgety foreign investors and local residents.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy as the opening of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal fields in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion as an investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling party Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and Renamo's party accuse each other of the created tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo's party claims that the government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Attacks on the former rebels then flared when government forces attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dkhlakama — the leader of the group, told the Financial Times of Fernando Mazanga, the representative Renamo.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government blames Renamo instituting clashes, accusing party of the attack on soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The president Armando Guebuza tried to dispel concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Guebuza said AFP, to the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt the &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;all that remained of his forces to try to prove that he can force the government, their own decisions&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that wars want to avoid.</seg>
		<seg id="16">However, concerns grew after the message that Mazanga said Renamo's refusal of the 1992 peace accord.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said the Financial Times that meant non-compliance with the agreement by party Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness&quot; — said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The previous negotiations between parties made for easing of intensity which was increased by a series of collisions this year a little.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;It is two influential people (Guebuza and Dkhlakama) who faced foreheads&quot; — Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open university and expert in Mozambique said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them is not a good negotiator and none of them are not prepared to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The party of Renamo, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to gain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The proportion of votes for Renamo been falling since 1992, whereas new party — the democracy movement of Mozambique (MDM) that was founded by a former member Renamo, as expected, was improving its performance on these elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza who should resign next year, when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want the world because he does not want to leave the presidency&quot; — said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear what opportunities Renamo has, however, it has carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key road leading from the North to the South.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the fights took place in Sofala province which is a few hundred kilometres North of Maputo, but includes Beira — port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June of Rio suspended the use of tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened with attack on the railway.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mazanga it was evasive when asked him whether Renamo will repeat this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo's party wanted &quot;to alert the international community that matters in Mozambique go too well&quot;, – said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Instability strengthened discontent with the government, and many people are also excited by corruption, slow rate of development and kidnappings which became frequent recently, speaks Fernando Lim, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that responsibility for the future of the country had the government and the president who has to find a solution to these problems&quot; — he says.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultuan, the demonstrator, said that people just want stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;No one is initiated by neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want the resumption of peace, they want a free access to roads&quot; — he said.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The prosecutor, q.c. Andrew Edis informed Old-Bailey's court that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World received doubtful news that Clarke meets the &quot;an attractive special sovetnitsa&quot; Hannah Polbi.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The newspaper requested the private detective Glenn Mulkeyr to hack voice mail of Polbi and trapped her at home to an interview, but also Koulson too called it and left voice messages — heard court.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Charge believes that Mr. Koulson who is currently NotW editor - it is not such a person who will stand next to someone's house, hoping to take someone by surprise, he is the person who likes to offer history for people to see what they say&quot; — Mr. Edis said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He said the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: breaking of phones, surveillance and the opposition.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.</seg>

		<seg id="13">Investigators also found computer records of the private detective in which Miss Polbi and her sister appeared as &quot;Projects&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">During the period when she was under surveillance, the grandparents of Ms. Polbi received anonymous calls with requests to provide information on her, Mr. Edis said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">At this time, the former chief reporter Neville Tyorlbek and former reporter James Uezerap controlled surveillance movement of Ms. Polbi.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Having left it a voice message on June 18 the 2005th, Koulson told: &quot;I have a history which we plan to publish tomorrow and which I very much would like to discuss with Charles&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists shed light on how the movements of the tail of the dog are associated with her mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier studies have shown that happy dog wagging its tail to the right side (in terms of the dog) while alarmed dogs vilna with a tail, mainly to the left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in wiggle by the tail and respond to them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, the neuroscientist from Trent university, says: &quot;It is well known that gave people the left and right sides of the brain differently participate in shaping driving forces who cause positive or negative emotions&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we tried to look at it and at other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that the same as a person at dogs the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs respond to multidisciplinary povilivaniye khvostov of other dogs, researchers tracked animals when they watch movies about other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the frequency of heartbeat of animals and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Perhaps we will understand already soon why their tails sometimes go to one side, and sometimes — to another</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have demonstrated to dogs of video with dogs — either naturalistic versions, or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding factors, and we can manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">When animals saw for the rest emotionless dog moved the tail to the right (in terms of the dog wagging tail), they remained entirely weakened.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they noticed that the tail inclined mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging tail), their heartbeat became frequent and they looked alarmed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think dogs deliberately communicated with each other with the help of these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In fact, he believes that dogs learned from the experience, what movements they should worry, and what — no.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He notices: &quot;If there are several meetings with other dogs and often wiggle their tail to one side are associated with more friendly behaviour, and the right side provides less friendly behaviour, the dog responds on the basis of this experience&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Researchers say that these results can yield to owners, vets and trainers a better understanding of emotions of the animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A specialist in behaviour of dogs John Bradshaw, visiting fellow at veterinary school of the University of Bristol, said he was not the first study to verify whether the left and right sides have value for dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a group of scientists from the university of Lincoln discovered that dogs turn heads to the left if look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if look at the happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in other scientific work of the university of Victoria in Canada, said: &quot;Dogs approached more frequently a dog robot when wiggle of her tail went to the left, but not to the right instead of becoming alarmed — contrary conduct in relation to the Italian research&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said that the differences could be because dogs are in various studies not fully perceived animals in movies or dogs robots as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It could be useful to study how dogs respond to the real dogs, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;While on various mammals there is sufficient evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs no exception&quot; — he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, given the ease with which their behaviour could perhaps be registered very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go to one side, and sometimes — to another.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Whether the elite of Europe is prepared to do business with England?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Campaign of Business for Britain was launched in April with the commitment to bring together representatives of business and to determine which changes the founders of prosperity and jobs of Great Britain want to see in relations with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To that end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to introduce the ideas of Great Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The YouGov company interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad swath of business in Britain in size, sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Findings of the poll would be surprise to many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found that the vast majority of businesses looking for export capabilities beyond Europe now, paying particular attention to the countries that modernized and grow, while EU countries to stagnate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want the government gave priority to new business relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, but did not spend time in a long and difficult process of reforming the confused EU institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When they were asked about their views of specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to the laws on production, most business leaders felt that control of these core competencies must be returned to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives said that spending from regulation by Brussels now outweigh the benefits of staying in a trade area of Europe - 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally, most of the proyevropeyska configured from all companies have agreed with him even.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The last and most indicative - our survey of business executives found that a clear majority wants Britain taught a course of a variation of the contract and for its relations with the EU based on trade, but not on policy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This result, which was seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business insists &quot;significant change&quot; that will return powers back to Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are high - fulfilling the changes in the contract and more favourable conditions for Great Britain will provide 16 per cent shift in the voting remaining in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The prime minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British business supports its plan to review conditions of membership of Great Britain in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that the case is that the review will lead to significant shift in the current balance of power back towards Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The best conditions for the British business are possible and are becoming more and more necessary because the eurozone took a way of closer economic and financial association.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority should be given to jobs and growth in Britain, and as show our survey, it means a strengthened focusing on trade for business and fundamental changes in standard activities of Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Why the vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, a correspondent for RIA-Novosti unclarified.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The people who absolutely denied animal products should not live in Siberia.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Here to them not to transfer winter without loss to health, and no casing tomatoes compensate for them, the Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of the Day of Wigan consider.</seg>
		<seg id="4">To drink oil in litres</seg>
		<seg id="5">The strict vegetarianism when refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.</seg>
		<seg id="6">However, dietitians are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia to adhere to such strict rules in food, at least insalubriously to health.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Full refusal of animal products is harmful.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Animal protein contains essential amino acids that are very difficult to repair the vegetable.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is necessary to include in a seimas at least milk or eggs &quot;- the dietician Marina Bogay is sure.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It cites as an example the fish containing irreplaceable Omega-3 fatty acid.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The richest with him vegetable/seed oil - underwear.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;To consume it in quantities are necessary for a man, you must drink in litres! &quot;- the nutritionist says.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Doctors are confident that residents of Siberia need to pay special attention to diet in the winter.</seg>
		<seg id="14">During this season, the vegetarianism is particularly called into question.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In the context of our realities require exceptional food.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Not to freeze the increased calorie content is needed.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;If the person limits himself on animal products, respectively, the calorie content he did not gather additionally&quot;, he says.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A registered dietitian Olga paznyak agrees.</seg>
		<seg id="19">She adds that imported vegetables and fruit isn't an option.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is better for person to feed mainly on products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The genetic code is set to the best assimilation and uptake of these products.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And in winter, people don't want not cucumber pogryzt and hot soup or something else posytny &quot;- the doctor explained the position.</seg>
		<seg id="23">According to her, from this, that vegetarians can eat, various cereals, grains, legumes, local vegetables, remaining apples at the winter, the frozen berries are relatively useful.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But, clearly, it is not enough for good food.</seg>
		<seg id="25">According to a gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians in organisms have a level of vitamins sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Full transition to vegetarianism in our rigid environment when the temperature could change in days to 30 degrees and in May snow lies is inappropriate.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The body to life needs energy, and that, above all, fat &quot;- is made by the doctor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Doctors note that the veganstvo is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Children grow, they need construction material, including in the form of amino acids.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And in line to vegetarianism, we give them the defective.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Pregnant women also need more protein, vitamins and microelements from the menu.</seg>
		<seg id="32">&quot;Veganki them is received less&quot;, - Bogay is sure.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Arifulina said that an adult is free to choose anything, &quot;to play those toys that wants&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="34">It has already created organism, the skeleton, bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="35">And yet the children should eat fully.</seg>
		<seg id="36">If parents give it any microelements or amino acids, choosing to him that he would eat, it is just a violation of the rights of the child.</seg>
		<seg id="37">&quot;Tomorrow, you will not restore the lack of certain substances for brain development, sight, bones any more&quot;, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="38">All interviewed medical professionals agree in opinion on low quality of growing in the winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruit.</seg>
		<seg id="39">That lead to us and grown in greenhouses, contains fewer microelements necessary for us than (grown) in an open ground.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;The Quality of products, not that&quot;, says Bogay.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Sometimes the desire of producers to reap a higher yield causes damage to quality.</seg>
		<seg id="43">&quot;Apples do not become brown on a cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and grow mouldy, tomatoes tasteless and not fragrant&quot; - the doctor gave examples, adding that they were likely to be stuffed with excessive amounts of fertilizers.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Also become suppliers not of vitamins, and pulp.</seg>
		<seg id="45">The Head of Laboratory of Siberian physical-technical institute of Agricultural Issues, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk does not agree with it.</seg>
		<seg id="46">She said that at the right approach and respect for all the rules and requirements in greenhouses cultivation of full vegetables is possible.</seg>
		<seg id="47">If they try to banish more from square metre, of course, and will begin to water more frequently, and to overfeed plants with mineral fertilizer.</seg>
		<seg id="48">For example, when there are too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes quickly grow, they large but watery and unsweetened &quot;, she explains, adding that the quality issue first depends conscience on the manufacturer.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Attempts to solve traffic problems of the major cities were observed in the majority of megacities of the world since the second half of the 20th century.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It was typically talked or their reorganization and expansion of roads, or attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and timing of their use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The example of Singapore, where the rigid quotas for a rise in the number of private cars is imposed is widely known, and the right of acquisition are bought at auction.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Its price may exceed the price of a car by two to three times.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The European cities, including London, imposed fees for entrance to the city centre.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, enter the so-called green zones where travelers is allowed cars with certain ecoclass also using quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).</seg>
		<seg id="7">The environment agency the protection of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 &quot;the five-year plan of clean air&quot; in the total cost about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).</seg>
		<seg id="8">As said &quot;Kommersant&quot; the director of enforcement of transport pollution of municipal bureau of Environmental protection of Beijing Lee Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year period - reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, growth in the number of private cars to the greater than 6 million (now 5.2 million) as well as increase for no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the agency, now Road in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of the general air pollution.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Among the main measures of the programme - limiting the use of the road, as well as additional taxes for car owners.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In addition, urban measures of &quot;The green five-year plan&quot; include the transition to fuel European standards accelerated compared with another country, the introduction of local system ecostandards and labelling of cars and fuel, restricting entry of cars to the central part of the city, a ban on outdated vehicles (in addition, a boost financial programme to replace old cars on hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and the office), development of public transport (including high-speed).</seg>
		<seg id="12">The ban for all private cars on the movement within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the People's Republic of China their six) one day in a week (the relevant information contains in registration plate of the vehicle), and also delivery of registration signs for cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of action of a lottery, the total of permissions to registration of private cars in Beijing made only a third of number of 2010) is also among automobile innovations of Beijing.</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to the existing &quot;Environmental Protection for 2012-2020&quot; state program, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in their 2012 was 138).</seg>
		<seg id="14">According to the Ministry to protect the Environment and Natural Resources, in 2011 on &quot;mobile sources&quot; 41% of all pollutant emissions in the atmosphere of cities fell.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars exceed industrial and, in St. Petersburg, by nine times ten times.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the Russian Federation so far, only start thinking about opportunities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The director of the Institute of transport economy and transport policy of HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that the administrative and fiscal measures to suppress demand for road trips - business clearly unpopular, they can be taken by society only on condition of their total universality.</seg>
		<seg id="18">If Moscow there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters poorly sensitive to any regulatory to influence the official and personal cars and cars &quot;exclusive&quot; users that the total number is not less than 200,000 (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow).</seg>
		<seg id="19">The other day urbanists from the WHAT center in St. Petersburg prepared a study where the balance of the urban areas between a housing estate, the area of pavement and the number of road transport is analysed.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Key findings of investigators: the city centre is provided by roads twice smaller required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or simply on the streets.</seg>
		<seg id="21">As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but storage of cars, not to expand, and to reduce the carriageway (the streets became more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of a security zone of the historic center (the total area about 3212 hectares covering a number of central regions of the city).</seg>

		<seg id="1">Dr. George Bvelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bvelle and his team perform almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In this West African country of doctors there is not a lot of — only one on 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or via your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. George Bvelle — one top 10 heroes of CNN of 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for it or for any of the other 10 main characters that he became a Hero of the year of CNN.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This person would receive $250 million to continuation of the outstanding work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years George Bvelle saw his father was restored to life and falling again into unconsciousness, wandering on hospitals that were not equipped to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Dzhamef Bvelle was injured in road accident in 1981, near Yaoundé, capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First at it the hand was only broken, but the arising prior infection spread to the brain and caused bruising that recalled itself until the end of life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;In Cameroon, there were no neurosurgeons — George Bvelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If we had money, we would make it from Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead of this Bvelle escorted for years, the father in a crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment which they could get.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is hard — Bvelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">— You can leave the house at 5 a.m., come running in the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There is a lot of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some may die because they should wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation is not much changed since the father Bvelle died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon, only one doctor for 5,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">By comparison, the ratio in the United States — one doctor for 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if Cameroonians could address to the doctor, it would be too expensive for much of them.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health expenditure in it are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Their only problem is poverty — Bvelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">— And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Seeing the suffering of the father and his very many compatriots, Bvelle has resolved to do anything about it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Last year, Dr George Bvelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central hospital Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It also established ASCOVIME non-profit organization that provides countryside trips on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, and his group of volunteers assisted nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, and to 30 people deadlock in vans, tie medical belongings to roofs and go on a rugged terrain to visit the villages in need.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Not always they are accompanied by good luck.</seg>
		<seg id="32">More than once they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they come, they meet, as real heroes: it is a celebration with songs and dances and the best rooms which local residents can only proposal.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason for a holiday, and Bvelle with his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join fun.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the crew begins accepting hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We accept 500 people on each trip&quot; — Bvelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come with all the district in a radius of 60 kilometres from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these clinics of the day off provides various medical services.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people were receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others may get crutches, the proposed points, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening the crew provides simple operations under local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Operations were usually performed in the school building, the municipality or in the house; after the procedure patients get up and go to the post-operative zone to make room for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Using a generator to cover operational and sanitary equipment processing, Bvelle and his volunteers work into the early morning hours of Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is excessive speed, but rural musicians usually help maintain the commitment of the crew.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They all night beating the drum that we were awake and continued to work&quot; — Bvelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday members of the crew go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">This group consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students performed 700 free operations for last year, and they know that their aid may be of great value to those they help.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One person explained that the free operation to treat hernia received by him would enable it to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;It will change the future for me and my family&quot; — the man said.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to these clinical receptions at weekends and work in the hospital as a surgeon Bvelle also works at the nights in private clinics around Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="51">This second work, according to him, provides 60% of financing its non-profit organization; other means be covered through private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I don't even know when he sleeps&quot; — Katie O'Malley, a medical student of the second year of Drekselsky university in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the group Bvelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He always or in hospital, or attempts to earn money for the organization that it was possible to continue those campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the US and Europe to join Bvella to achieve its objectives, is the ability of practice that they were never at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We had the opportunity to assist on operations where we helped remove spots of blood or hold tools for doctor Bvelle&quot; — O'Malley said.</seg>
		<seg id="56">As a student second-year student, you would never get this possibility in America.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Student volunteers usually pay the journey to Cameroon, often arriving with the proposed drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But on arrival in Yaoundé their food, transport and training Drew by Bvelle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;It is a hero, undoubtedly&quot; — O'Malley said.</seg>
		<seg id="60">It provides the life of this organization, and his desire to help people of Cameroon indefinitely.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bvelle almost permanent the workload is not a difficult experience.</seg>
		<seg id="62">To help lead happy life to another, to keep its promise to the father — him that brings it great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I do this work - Bvelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="64">— And I think of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I do it that people laughed to reduce their pain.</seg>

		<seg id="0">To &quot;the Russian mafia&quot; in the US, the new name - &quot;A sister circle&quot; was finally assigned</seg>
		<seg id="1">This week, the black list of &quot;the Russian mafia&quot; in America was filled with new names and four companies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The US Treasury entered into &quot;A sister circle&quot; of the three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and the Israeli.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A famous singer Grigori Leps, whom the US suspect of carriage of money to members of the group was one of the Russians.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In total in a black list of the US 22 people involved in &quot;A sister circle&quot; and six entities affiliated with it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">However, many experts have questioned that such organization does exist.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;A statement to 'A fraternal circle' is like trying to combine separate criminal groups&quot; more, an expert in organized crime and professor at the University of New York Mark Galeotti said earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In his view, &quot;The fraternal circle&quot; reflects a popular perception of &quot;the Russian mafia&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;I didn't meet anybody in the Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such criminal organisation&quot;, - quotes Mr. Galeotti the American Center for research of corruption and organized crime.</seg>
		<seg id="9">A professor at George Mason University Liz Shelley also agrees with Mr. Galeotti.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;If they also work together, it is more like a criminal network, but not the organization&quot; - the Centre for research of corruption and organized crime provides her words.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti suggested that &quot;The fraternal circle&quot; brings together in a greater measure of confidants of the Russian kingpin Aslan Usoyan known as Grandpa Hassan.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The criminal authority was killed in January this year.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus, Lasha Shushanashvili's activities and xachariah Kalashova, filled up the list in 2012, was closely associated with Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri mirzoev had to Grandpa Hassan nephew.</seg>
		<seg id="14">However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals and have nothing to do with Usoyan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In his opinion, all of them were united by rather common financial and criminal interests, for example supply of drugs from Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the scandal over inclusion in &quot;A sister circle&quot; of grigorii Leps, a favorite singer of the Russian president Vladimir Putin - drew the attention of the Kremlin.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It first of all crisis of defaults on poor consumer credit and mass dismissals of workers.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Our main concern now - not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Recently it is entirely due to consumption, which almost does not reduce queues &quot;- the chief economist at Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Graf said, introducing a quarterly report of Investbank on the Russian economy yesterday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Now the nominal growth of salaries in Russia - about 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At inflation in 6% it will be able to provide future consumer demand around the current level, expect in Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But profitability of the Russian companies falls so probably they will be established to improve staff costs.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are rising to 10%, GDP - only to 2%, Mr. Grafe explained.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Companies have faced profitability reduction.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If she did not grow up, it could lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Russian business could raise the salaries, chief economist at Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin comments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Unemployment near historic lows, competition for workers high.</seg>
		<seg id="13">To lure staff from the party or to hold this, employers should raise wages.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Consumption in Russia is also supported by very rapid growth in consumer credit.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to Mr. Grafe, because of the highest rates on consumer loans of multiplicative effect this type of credit does not have on the national economy.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;We are no did not see the benefit for economy of consumer credit growth, money is not at odds on the economy, and returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments&quot; - the economist said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But the problem in other - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on the poor loans.</seg>
		<seg id="18">They are taken by mostly relatively poor people who have nothing to provide in security.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Interest on such loans high.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, do not return to their more often &quot;, Mr. Grafe noted.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia - possible crisis of defaults on poor loans.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The director of the HSE Bank institute Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of emerging banking crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Small credit institutions, without access to cheap resources which the State Banks have, were forced to raise funds of the population with high interest.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In response, the State Banks came to the track of war and began to reduce lending rates, says economist continues.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Small credit institutions cannot give out loans under the same per cent, or they will have a negative interest margins.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If the State Banks do not refuse a dumping, Russia is threatened by full bank crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In recent weeks, the economist believes the cancellation of certificates of a number of banks as a harbinger of mass crash.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;The State Banks will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was never intended to systemic crisis &quot;, the head of the institute warns.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But growth in consumption will slow down and without crisis of non-payments, believe in Investbank - because of failure of indexation of salaries of civil servants and military, put in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Partly the autumn to consumption will be broken by a freezing tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, lower inflation).</seg>
		<seg id="31">But only a point: if investments do not grow (and prerequisites to it are not yet available - see the reference), increasing consumption all the same will be slow, are confident of Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not see prerequisites for implementation of pessimistic scenarios yet.</seg>
		<seg id="33">&quot;The main risk is still falling oil prices&quot;, he says.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In his estimation, Russia's economy will begin to decline at the cost of oil less than 90 dollars/barrel.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank yet not in force to lower interest rates in the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The paradoxical picture is observed: inflation fell, and banks began to increase rates.</seg>
		<seg id="37">This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to an inflation targeting &quot;, - Clemens Graf said.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The percentage the Central Bank policy does not affect market rates, only affects pace of interbank lending.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;For the Central Bank is the collapse of all hopes&quot;, - Clemens Graf assessed.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The money received at auctions of the Central Bank uses banks not lending to economy, and for the office of the liquidity</seg>
		<seg id="41">As soon as the rates are falling, the exchange rate changes at once, it means that the funds try to leave on speculation against ruble.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work&quot;, Mr. Grafe said and recalled that the state plans to start up ruble in &quot;free swimming&quot; by the end of 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But it is necessary or to do it before, or to increase the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he says.</seg>
		<seg id="44">In his estimation, rouble exchange rate is now artificially by 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="45">I cut only one road - to weaken, the expert concludes.</seg>
		<seg id="46">But if the Central Bank has provoked in financiers while a reasonable doubt that the elimination of a currency corridor is not part of a policy along with their weakening of the ruble, it can bring down ruble much stronger.</seg>

		<seg id="0">THE FAW: &quot;Air passengers can use gadgets now by aircraft (but not to call from a mobile phone)&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Air passengers will be able to use the electronic devices throughout the voyage to read, work, play games, movies and listen to music, but not to talk by mobile phones — according to the long-awaited new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect changes will occur immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly this change is implemented, will vary depending on airline, the FAU administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference said.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Airlines should show the FAW as their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update the manuals for members of the flight crew and the rule to lay devices to conform to the new guidelines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAW said that he had already received plans from some airlines to increased use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that have already submitted plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the state of the plan we could approve the increased use of electronic devices soon&quot; — said FAS.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now passengers are required to disable the smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the plane is closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They should not restart them until the plane reaches the height of 10,000 feet and captain will not give a green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers have to turn off devices again when the plane decreases to planting, and not to include them until the plane appears on earth.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference, may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxing, said the FAW.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most of the new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, as expected, meet these criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glejding, president of the Association of professional stewards, welcomed these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;After the new policy will be safely implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to do so), it will be a sure bet&quot; — said Gleyding.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We frankly tired to feel like &quot;persons on duty on school&quot; when it comes to this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Internet connection to surf, an exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at the height of less than 10,000 feet, reported the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It will be invited to passengers to switch the smartphones, tablets and other devices in a plane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thus, still any &quot;Words with friends&quot; — intellectual Internet game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on a smartphone in 2011 when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from the plane of American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device when the plane was at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices such as laptops, it will still be required to pile in the luggage compartment as they can hurt someone if fly on all salon.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also remain prohibited.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Regulatory powers to phone calls relate to the Federal Communications commission, but not the FAW.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The FAW can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month Mark Rozenker from the National Transportation safety Board, the national expert on the safety of the transport of CBS News, stated that cell phones are still regarded as risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Cell phones — it is really a problem not only because they have the potential to interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell phone towers when the plane is airborne&quot; — Rozenker said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The industry advisory committee created by the FAW to examine this issue recommended last month that the government allowed greater use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years, pressure on the FAW for the purpose of easing of restrictions on their use has increased.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as Democratic senator from Missouri Claire Makkaskil, argue that for the prohibition there is no compelling reasons of security.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Compliance with restrictions also becomes increasingly difficult to be provided as the use of devices becomes universal.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies show that to a third of passengers forget or ignored instructions to shut down the devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAW started restricting use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966, in response to reports of interference with the navigation and communication equipment when passengers launched with themselves FM radios — high-tech gadgets that time.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of planes, but they are also developed and approved by the FAW as resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines offer passengers using Wi-fi at cruising altitude for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The planes modified for Wi - Fi - systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of liners is adapted to greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, said Huerta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices usually radiate radio signals of a much lower power than previous generations of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit minimal signals when you turn the pages.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the signs are more powerful when devices download or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among those who achieved easing restrictions on the use by passengers of electronic devices, there was an Amazon.com company.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011 the representatives of the company loaded the entire airliner devices for reading e-books Kindle and flew on him to check for problems, but did not find them.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the FAS advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether any risk is the use of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from the National association of air passengers said that considers interference from devices real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other members of the committee said that there are only individual reports of pilots affirming that devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of these reports, the very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAW allowed pilots to require passengers to disable devices during instrument landings in limited visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The group of representatives of the tourism industry has welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step toward passengers who now use a set of technological devices.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that the FAW acknowledges that the comfort of passengers was not incompatible with safety and security&quot; — Roger Dow, the director-general of Tourist association of the USA said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could deprive the process of cigarette smoking of joy.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further testing before tests in the public are necessary, to which some years, but professor Ronald Kristall from medical college will be required Whale Cornell in New York said that the first results encouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We very much hope that such a strategy of the use of a vaccine can help, finally, to millions of smokers who tried to throw, having tried all methods that are available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction strong enough to overcome it through these modern means&quot; — professor Cornell said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotinic antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start making a steady stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Antibodies track down any molecules of nicotine in blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing financial nicotine blow by a smoker.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In tests the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine subsequently, continued their normal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And mice who had not been given a vaccine, &quot;relaxed&quot; and it is a sign that nicotine reached their brain, for the researchers say.</seg>
		<seg id="10">These experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine journal.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of a new vaccine will probably be much lower, because it turns liver cells into factories of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professor Kristall said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely that she will be used by smokers to quit smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They will know that if they will start smoking again, they will not receive from this joy because nicotine vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit&quot; — he said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned that further studies are needed.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Border Airlines plans to charge passengers to $100 that they are in hand luggage on board a flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Border Airlines plans to start raising up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to leave themselves all can.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new payment for hand luggage extends to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Border said that will levy $25 if the tax is paid in advance, and $100 if traveling pay, with only have been at a gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The representative of the state border Kate O'Malley said the payment of $100 must force passengers to think of payment in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We don't want to charge for it&quot; — she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Companies have begun charging fees for the first and second bag surrendered in luggage, in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers trying to avoid these fees fill so much, how many will be able, in your hand luggage placed in the top luggage compartments because of what in these compartments often there is no place.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Collection — one way to force passengers to carry by less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'Malley said the new charges not really for the sake of making money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The fact is that the most loyal customers of border state that it becomes more difficult to find a place in the top luggage compartments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy tickets on the site of the airline would not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that a passenger in turn at the opening to the flight border may be able to carry a bag free of charge, while the next passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'Malley said that changing procedures on the website and at the check-in desks of border is designed to ensure that passengers will know about taxes before they get to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">New charge border for hand luggage will not begun to be raised until the summer, although the date has not yet been set.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often complain about the pay for baggage and other charges, but airlines adore them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service, have to pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street believe addition of baggage collection is familiar that airlines raise enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However, most of them did not concern charges for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. entered the first charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another discounter of Allegiant Air followed suit later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such taxes is the Hungarian Wizz Air, a consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen who closely tracks additional charges said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In his assessment in the report of December 2011, the prosecution for hand luggage brings Spirit of $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former senior manager of the Midwest Airlines, flew the flight Spirit recently, and it was interesting to him that he would find in the gate when passengers face unusual charge Spirit for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The process of landing was the smoothest that I had seen in his career in airlines&quot; — he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see gnashing of teeth, and the emergence of a fight at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he said, &quot;and landing held rapidly&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Border also follows Spirit on the payment of $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Border said that passengers who get soda or juice, can leave themselves all can and that adding coffee it will be available free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="29">She will still distribute free of charge water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but denied it in seven months after passengers started to complain and no other major airline followed suit.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Border initiative of charging for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline — is its last resort to attract customers on its website.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay online sellers of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It allowed all airlines incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, but not to resort to online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But border went further all in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, he started to serve twice less bonus miles of often flying passenger to customers who bought tickets through online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday it cut bonus number of miles to 25 per cent from a trip miles.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So, a trip to 1,000 miles with border purchased from online travel agency would allow to receive 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the site border.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Border have a base of loyal customers in his hometown of Denver, but his case is reduced and becomes unprofitable.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Revenue fell by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities were reduced by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results, published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic is trying to correct border finance within sale to airline.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The parents of intersex children could choose &quot;uncertain sex&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany was the first European country to recognize the third floor at the children born with external genitals of intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The newborn will not necessarily attribute male or female any more.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new law does not require parents to call any gender of these children, allowing parents to specify gender as &quot;uncertain&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot; in their birth certificates.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions on exploitation on assignment of a floor by the newborn, and counter discrimination of intersex people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I'm not a man and not a woman&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain the patchwork product created by doctors with bruises and scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">About one of two thousand children born each year is neither the boy nor the girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They have an interseksualnost, one of about 60 pathological states that fall under the diagnosis of &quot;breach of sexual development&quot; — the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovarian or testes) or unusually developed external genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson may have been interseksualy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Gender identity remains poorly understood, but most experts in the US say that if the sex cannot be identified, better to use all available information and to give it than to wait and trace psychological and physical development of the child before the operation if at all, it will happen.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher who specializes in issues of gender identity, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have threatening violation lives that require surgery, but most children does not have them&quot; — he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can assign a floor without operation and then look as a person develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science how at the child any gender identity will develop, is not very accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one can answer questions about why it happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It as a mystery about why people also being homosexual.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The report sent to the European commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transgender or transgender as their state is not concerned with gender, and their biological structure that does not meet only neither male nor female, and is typical of both at the same time, or is not specific to one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics can be shown in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, distribution of hair, the breast and the constitution; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also provides an overview of discrimination, intersex and transgender people in employment, and about the level of harassment, cruelty and crimes because of prejudice face.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Boys with gender biases have a special camp now.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal has already allow adults to put male, female or &quot;the third floor&quot; in the official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia Norri Mai-Uelbi became the first person, recognized &quot;asexual&quot; by defended in court the right to save the &quot;uncertain&quot; sexual status for life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Interior, in the German passports third symbol in addition to M and F — X, that is intersex will be used.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighbouring France gender issues still be controversial, according to news release on the France 24 channel.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011 dozens of lawmakers from France, this imposed Catholic country, signed a petition to seize &quot;the gender theory&quot; from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with the German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is involved in a new state where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity — no, we overturn two other pillars of civilization&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="28">One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that applied to children sex at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;To raise the child relatively hard and without additional restrictions, particularly if you don't know the sex of the child&quot; — she told the website for parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born with male and female genitalia, called hermaphrodites — by name beautiful Greek god who wielded signs of both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And more than just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then back to draw.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now many challenge the ethical foundations for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the floor assigned to it when grows.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the middle of the 20th century it was called&quot; an urgent psychiatric case &quot;&quot; — Drescher said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When these children were born, you called not a psychiatrist — you called the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The dominant theory of how to treat children with mutilation of intermediate type, was proposed by Dr John Mani at Johns Hopkins University, who considered that gender is easily change.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He introduced the term &quot;gender identity&quot; into circulation and claimed that environment signals, including social — how parents raise the child — interact with genes and the child's hormones, defining, whether the person will consider himself as the man or the woman.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one case of 1966 known as &quot;John/Joan&quot;, his theories had been called into question.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the boy's parents, whose penis was injured during negligent circumcision, to fully gelding the child, having also deleted his testicles, and to raise it as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Mani presented a case as a good example of transition, but it was not so&quot; — Drescher said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15 years old, he is again a boy and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But in 38 years he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher said that now some doctors still &quot;apply this model&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations on a sex change announced themselves &quot;unhappy with result&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="45">That is was also Jim Bruce's case, the 36-year-old writer from the State of Montana, which was born with male chromosomes of XY but mutilation of intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors could not determine accurately whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis, and were confident that he will never be able to lead &quot;fulfilling life&quot; of the man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, the external genital and Bruce's testicles were surgically removed, and it was raised as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Began to give it female hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I am not a girl&quot; — he said ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was miserable, but it was very difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In 18 years to it the vaginoplastika was appointed.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But while in depression and understanding that something is wrong, he required medical records.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he learned was awful.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which did not give it to the body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of mutilation.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Having learned the truth, he is again a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing the chest.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Operation made it futile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, he defended others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring into norm perception of people with an interseksualnost.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Ann Temar-Mettis, executive director of the California law association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law &quot;tends to encourage the demonization and stigma&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and to give the child&quot; uncertain sex &quot;&quot; — she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We fear that it will promote intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We believe that it is better to appropriate male or female, and then wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we have yet to see how this law, therefore, everything will prove that we can do — it to speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Temar-Mettis said her organization supports the Australian law as &quot;it allows adults to opt for the third floor&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions on a formal sex&quot; — she says.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law means its request at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This battle that small children should not enter at this stage.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own body.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arleene Barats, the mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter in violation of sexual development and that helps hundreds of other people with the support group, said that the German law &quot;will support&quot; both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">The daughter Barats, Katy, was born with male chromosomes, but it has a violation of sexual development under the name &quot;syndrome full tolerance to androgens&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="71">As its androgenic receptors not work properly, at Katie female signs developed.</seg>
		<seg id="72">He has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now, in 29 years, Katie is married and studies internship in child psychiatry at the university of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Despite the fact that she was infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions&quot; — Barats said.</seg>
		<seg id="76">He gives them time to make some analyses and to understand the situation, as well as the period before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In that case you as it should be — raise a child, love the child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We don't need to make a transaction that is nonreversible hasty.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that moves parents because they don't feel they do well&quot; — she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Ultimately, the child will decide with what floor to him or her is more comfortable — and it is remarkable.</seg>
		<seg id="82">It gives children the chance to make the decision independently.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On Thursday the court of appeal of the federal district has suspended a court order requiring changes to stop-and-search programme of the New York police department and discharged a judge of business.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The court of appeal of the second Circuit of the US announced that the execution of the decisions of the judge Shira Sheyndlin will be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution how it implemented a programme for street detention and interrogation.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city filed an appeal to its decision and resolutions on corrective measures, including an instruction to appoint a controller to help police station to alter its practices and related training programme.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On Thursday, the court of Appeal heard debate of the parties on the application for a business suspension.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The court of Appeal said the need to remove the judge because it violated the code of conduct for judges of the US and is not counted on the need to avoid bias demonstration, partly because of an interview series in the media and the official statements containing the public response to criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge ruled that police violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably turning to black and Hispanic according to the stop-and-search program.</seg>
		<seg id="8">She appointed an external controller for oversight of large-scale changes that include reforms in area, the politician, of training and control, and decided to begin a pilot program to test the video cameras mounted on a body in those police stations where there is a majority of detention.</seg>

		<seg id="13">In 2004, four people, all and representatives of national minorities, sued the collective claim.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Supporters of changes in the stop-and-search programme in the New York police department say these changes will put an end to the unfair practice, would create a more reliable and efficient police service and could affect how other police departments realize this practice.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Opponents argue that changes will reduce the morale of police officers, but not crime rates, will lead to unnecessary waste of money and will not solve more global problem of difficult circumstances in police because the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The judge noted that she does not stop practice &quot;to stop-and-search&quot; that corresponds to the constitution, but changes the way with what the New York police stops people.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The federal government insists that the rescue package of $325 million for the weakened health of Tasmania will be supplemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the state government will not spend means for nothing.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek said that the Commonwealth is &quot;urgent action&quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island nation, a higher level of chronic diseases and limitations of the system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The decision on funding for four years was made after consultation of the government with the independent member of Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government proposed a package of the emergency rescue, which we believe will address specific problems, facing staff&quot; — Ms. Plibersek announced today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The package of $325 million in size includes $31 million to blitz campaign to planned operations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Further 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract operations, would help overcome backlog.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There is also money for the clinics receiving patients _without in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after a hospital, the training of medical experts, mental health services and introducing systems of personal electronic health records in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments will go on the ideas expressed by the best doctors realization how best to help health system of Tasmania&quot; — Ms. Plibersek said.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will work in the regime of strict accountability and responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Staff will need to support the current funding levels to receive funds from the Commonwealth, and monthly to report on where it spends these additional resources.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The commission of three people will be created to make sure staff provides services as effectively as possible and is more effective.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr. Wilkie declared today that $325 million will solve nothing, &quot;if they are not followed by original reform which will put health system of Tasmania on steadier basis&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless, he praised the government to respond to its request for an urgent assistance with which he first turned to the prime minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I hope that the package of the federal help will promote considerably to a conclusion of health system of this staff from critical condition&quot; — Mr. Wilkie told.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the state government, these additional electoral procedures largely offset recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the federal opposition representative on health Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is &quot;a decision similar to the adhesive plaster&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason why we are here, is that Labour state government pulled out $430 million from a health system&quot; — he said ABC TV television companies.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When the state government tears off nearly half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth puts 300 million, it is impossible to pretend that it is good news.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from a rescue package would not be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I voted for president Obama twice, sharing the hope for the possibility of change</seg>
		<seg id="2">He said that Obama allowed obstructionism of republicans to nullify commendable efforts.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The obstruction cannot excuse problems with the website of the health system reformed by Obama attacks of UAVs</seg>
		<seg id="4">Memories of the Obama campaign are of 2008 a sad reminder of what could be</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris — the second-year student of medicine at Harvard university.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I read terribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I thought that this book will inspire me at the time of sadness at the second year of medical school and will allow me to have a sense of hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;audacity to win&quot; and these are memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I stop writing reports on my patients in the evening and I go to bed, this book returns me when the policy encouraged millions of people, and speeches could capture spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The victory was impressive, and hosts of news programmes have pause for reflection of this historic moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates wept with happiness, and my parents protected all newspapers that only they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The young team of strategists had to come to the White house, and people were prepared to change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In an effective date of Obama in the post in 2008, its level of support made 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Return to the present is rude awakening as wrest from dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years since I lowered the first ballot, changes have been made.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was that I could not even imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I give Obama commended for its large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable health care to the conclusion of our military from Iraq, cancellation of the rule &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot;, Osama bin Laden's murder.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Indeed, I believe that the party obstructionism blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health and the closing of the base in Guantánamo among others.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after innumerable times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, protecting it before colleagues and peers, I finished the explanation that I can provide.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I reached a point of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The obstruction of republicans cannot explain leave to wiretap of foreign leaders or the strike of UAVs on innocent children in other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He cannot explain data collection on privacy of Americans by the National security agency or persecution of the debunkers opening illegal actions of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He could not explain the deaths of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki out of court or non-compliance with limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which stated that the efforts used by the White house to silence the media, are &quot;the most aggressive … since the Nixon administration&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="27">And recently it cannot justify that it is not possible to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I don't know whether it to me to be expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Whether I had to understand at the age of 18 years, what the management can contradict political campaigns which precede it?</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is clear that the work of elective office is not a predictable programme of action as our public dialogue will be formed by opposition political party and such random events as massacre in Newtown.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Nevertheless by all examples which are listed above by me it is visible that they substantially were own choice of administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And it what bothers me most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I once again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney submitted incomprehensible and rough alternative, it seemed as if he is unable to decide on their own policies or views.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I believed that in the second time Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, will meet the expectations that we have heard in such a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, this week when Obama's ratings have dipped below 45%, it has become much harder to come back in 2008 through this book.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me long for the many commitments have disappeared.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week, I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton retreat in Obama resounding defeat in primary elections in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At the meeting, according to an analysis of the reasons for non-implementation it has told staff that they should return to normal and remain loyal to the end.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I wish that we return our call — he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">— We must remember who we are &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Five years have passed, Mr. president, and I absolutely agree with you.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohamed Morsi took the oath, but the date of its celebration is unlikely to mark the end of political struggle in Egypt.</seg>

		<seg id="3">On the inauguration before the Supreme constitutional court of Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in the courthouse on the banks of the Nile built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We seek a better future, new Egypt and the second republic&quot; — Morsi during a ceremony which is broadcast live on state television said.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability&quot; — Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, fundamentalist group, which the majority of 84 years of its existence was a proscribed organisation serving as a target for tough action of successive governments said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Morsi arrived with a small train soon after the 11th morning local time.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the presidential hydor times of Mubarak, the movement was halted for only a short time to move his convoy in the usually lively road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Although Morsi derided as not charismatic &quot;spare wheel&quot; of &quot;Brothers&quot;, his personal prestige shot up from the moment of his victory and Friday statement in which he tried to present itself (himself) as a candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who want to finish this uprising of 2011 against authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state&quot; — Morsi wearing a blue suit case with a red tie, to judges in the room lined with wooden panels, where he took the oath said.</seg>
		<seg id="11">After Morsi went to Cairo university, where he had to deliver his inaugural speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">An official reception with the army orchestra which fulfilled the national anthem during which he stood at attention &quot;quietly&quot; was extended to it.</seg>
		<seg id="13">There was a military figure field marshal Hussein Tantawi.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Its arrival was met by the slogan &quot;Army and the People — One Hand&quot; which was chanted by hundreds of audience in the main lecture hall of university.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo university in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamic student groups.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that completed authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year arose and promised to return the powers of the president of which his position was denied by the Council of War, which accepted cases from the deposed leader.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But having agreed to take the oath of office before the courts, but not before parliament as it is adopted, it carries out the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.</seg>

		<seg id="3">The German media say that bfvs hoped to find antennas of listening devices, and these actions caused negotiations between the US and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Klepper, director of National intelligence of the US, in September, reassured that the US do not use the foreign intelligence &quot;for the theft of trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden — the contract employee who was the unmasker — started publishing a treasury of secrets of the intelligence of the United States, European governments and business leaders are not sure any more, if he can take the director, the word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports about the National Security agency of the US monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in cloud service providers of the US including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of corporations caused by surveillance of the state to new heights.</seg>
		<seg id="7">News that the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel was heard, perhaps about 10 years is the last straw.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the most powerful man of Europe can become a target, of course, potential targets are also business leaders.</seg>

		<seg id="10">I think it is likely that these data are used to mutual benefit.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Germany must wake up&quot; — Oliver Gryun, president of the association BITMi, which is small and medium IT companies in Germany says.</seg>
		<seg id="12">German companies are confident that the US now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consulting agency Eee.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In all documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, nevertheless, there was no evidence that the US transferred trade secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Politicians expressed concern that the EU is not enough some opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that he should try to reduce their dependence on the US.</seg>

		<seg id="22">And yet the scope and technical development of agencies on espionage of the US became renowned for Snowden's revelations were shock for some companies that used to think the biggest risk of surveillance is China.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;This terrible place, is also the reason for the question: what may prevent destruction of judicial independence by Parliament in the future? &quot;— the newspaper reported, calling the law is unconstitutional.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;The law very harsh and punitive, and we reject it&quot; — Cyrus Kamau, the managing director of Capital Group - the parent company CapitalFM into which one of the independent radio stations that are most respected in Kenya and the news site enters said.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He said the new judicial authority on media &quot;will always be biased as it is a continuation of the government&quot; and restrictions on content and advertising will do much harm to the situation of Kenya in the global economy.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and to return it to deputies&quot; — he told.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the The Star newspaper, the new law would essentially allow the government &quot;to take media stranglehold&quot; and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya &quot;received a serious blow&quot; and criticized the bill as &quot;draconian&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen the national security after the September attack of Muslim terrorists in the mall Westgate.</seg>

		<seg id="10">The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the perpetrator if the penalty was not paid.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to Daily Nation, &quot;one has only one penalty to paralyse the majority of FM radio stations&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">She also reported that these measures can have devastating effect on the so-called &quot;a lively blogosphere&quot; of Kenya.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Politicians understand that, with the media silent, they will be able to do whatever they will take in head, with impunity.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Nobody ever learns&quot; — journalist of Nation Mutuma Matthew wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.</seg>

		<seg id="2">However, on 1 November, the person involved in the business of &quot;Oboronservis&quot; violated silence.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Said in an interview of Life News of Vasiliev: &quot;Initially, of course, the task was made just one: to pull out of me any negative information concerning the former Defence Minister &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">There was a blackmail in what I have to testify, otherwise I would go to jail.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Today these threats stopped.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Next, we go to court, we will prove his innocence.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We are confident of victory for 100 per cent.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Thus from interview it is possible to draw a conclusion that, perhaps, most of all Vasilyeva was touched by words that at her is unimportant with taste.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Perhaps the statement by the official representative of the RF IC Vladimir Markin that in a collection of paintings, which was collected by the person involved in the business of &quot;Oboronservis&quot;, forgery, were found means.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Among the seized property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident in the deep knowledge of art, got as masterpieces of world painting.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However, the art criticism examination appointed by investigators after the arrest of these pictures found that they have no artistic value and, quite simply, are cheap imitation &quot;, - Markin in early October noted.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defence...</seg>
		<seg id="13">Then, after all admitted that they from the Ministry of Defence are not stolen, and said to me it is bad with the taste.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?</seg>
		<seg id="15">In my opinion, it's just a lawlessness &quot;- says vasiljeva.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In response to the question as to whether she would plead guilty while one of the 12 criminal episodes attributed to it, Vasiliev said: &quot;Naturally, no.</seg>
		<seg id="17">There is nothing to recognize in general.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Simply mislead the people, that's all.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In addition, in response to today's statement by the RF IC that vasiljeva refrained from dealing with the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer for the person involved announced that he and his client &quot;the investigator made it impossible to get acquainted with the case file&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="21">What served as a reason to revelations by vasiljeva who is under house arrest, who was still not communicating with the press?</seg>
		<seg id="22">It is possible how the woman she could not but respond to the charge of bad taste?</seg>
		<seg id="23">Or the journalists of Komsomolskaya Pravda claiming a couple of days ago are right, what it &quot;fell even further into trance under house arrest&quot; because of news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family fold?</seg>
		<seg id="24">The famous military observer of &quot;KP&quot; Viktor Baranets in the article &quot;Serdyukov returned to the wife? &quot;wrote: &quot;Investigators do not exclude that after such a shock it may become more talkative during interrogations&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="18">Borschev believes that security officers by appointing the chairman of the KIO, will be able to do the work of human rights defenders unbearable so human rights defenders do not kick a collective exit from the commission.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In their view, promotion of security officers is coordinated by a member of the KIO Anton Tsvetkov title &quot;Officers of Russia&quot; - the advocacy organization for security forces.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Rosbalt agency deprived of the status of the media to verbal abuse</seg>
		<seg id="1">On 31 October, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the licence to register Rosbalt agency - &quot;Tape&quot; writes.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Drew Roscomnadzor on deprivation of the agency of the status of media - for the systematic and gross violations of the media law.</seg>
		<seg id="3">During the process unpleasant precedent has been created: the court said that it was possible to close the media, in fact had refused to the publication the right to nominate counter-reply.</seg>
		<seg id="4">What is &quot;Rosbalt&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">JSC Rosbalt News Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the coming years, the agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Also submissions to the countries of the former USSR work for the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since 2001 &quot;Rosbalt&quot; develop and operate as federal information and analysis agency.</seg>
		<seg id="9">By the middle of the 2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Thus &quot;Rosbalt&quot; always busy quite specific niche: notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies have been the centre of exclusive publications of the agency (and make still).</seg>
		<seg id="11">Talk about the proximity of the publication to power continued throughout the existence of the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Along with that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; had extensive base of sources in various departments, such assumptions were spoken well also with that the project Natalya was at the head of Chaplin - Victor Cherkesov's wife.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus Chaplina's role in the office of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is not fully clear: most often it is called &quot;project manager&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The director general of the agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-in-chief - Nikolai Ulyanov.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Recently &quot;Rosbalt&quot; did not appear in the ratings of federal media - either on the quoting nor on the audience.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In October, the agency took the 25th place in the top in attendance at sites of the Russian media under LiveInternet.</seg>
		<seg id="17">According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500,000 viewings), monthly - up to three million unique visitors.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Among the most popular materials for the past five months - a note on the powerlessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the singer of King and Clown group, pogroms in capital Biryulev.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The conflict of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; to Roscomnadzor began in July 2013, when the amendments to the media law that banned journalists obscene abuse came into force.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Department found the forbidden lexicon in two videos published on the site of agency (&quot;The Dzhigit from Krasnodar&quot; and &quot;The Pussy Riot was profaned by oil derricks&quot;).</seg>
		<seg id="21">The parties have further describe differently.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Roscomnadzor on the basis of the found videos accused &quot;Rosbalt&quot; gross and systematic violation of the law on media and took legal action to select the licence at the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In &quot;Rosbalt&quot; said that claims of the division are illegal: first, clips were not editorials, secondly, obscene words in them were masked, and, thirdly, right after a warning clips were removed from the site.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Representatives of the agency appealed against claims of Roscomnadzor in world court - and when 22 October 2013, the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roscomnadzor, consideration of these complaints continued.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But already the 25th the magistrate decided not in favour of &quot;Rosbalt&quot;: editor-in-chief - Alexander savelyev had been found guilty of breaching the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles, per 10,000 for each movie.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Obviously, it also determined the hearing outcome in Moscow City Court - if you give up the idea that the outcome could be prejudged even earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="27">On 31 October, the court decided to reverse the certificate of registration of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; while effectively deprived agency of the status of the media.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is impossible to say that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; during this opposition remained alone.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The agency was supported by members of the State Duma (the petition to the head of Roscomnadzor Alexander Zharov was signed on October 10 by 26 deputies; the document was filed at the initiative of the CPRF).</seg>
		<seg id="30">The illegality of closure of the publication was announced by the head of the Russian Union of journalists Abhisit Vejjajiva, chairman of the Moscow union of journalists Paul Gusev and head of the Presidential Council on human rights Mikhail Fedotov.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Office of Roscomnadzor even provided it some assurance that business will not reach licence revocation.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The trial of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; showed: under whose jurisdiction, it is safer to be to media in Russia today - a big issue.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A British businessman created the world's first ice cream shining in the dark using the Medusa.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of the sea beast to develop a shining food.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He came to this idea, having read the scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced researchers in China chemically to recreate the shining protein.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Ice cream reacts with the language of the one who eats it, making the pH in protein and forcing him to shine.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The protein, which we use in ice cream, reacts with your tongue at neutral pH conditions.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So when your mouth warms protein, it will increase the pH and ice cream will start glow.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We tested it in the past few months, and it seemed that it would be ideal to submit it to the Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream that I did because the glow of Medusa is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George kerewan: the gap with Europe gives Scots selection</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another horror story about independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The turn of stories about the passport control in Bervike and the border with barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall comes.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed out the possible economic benefits from freer movements over the other Europe, although. then is predictable — it did not appear in headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nor did not indicate that EU Member States spend a lot of time to make the formal rules as it suits them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As Scotland is not currently included to the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance with the requirements will be a cheap concession for Brussels instead of what she really wanted from Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So it is a story that is not merit attention.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And such old that it has become a fossil: for the first time I heard &quot;duck&quot; that &quot;independence means passport control&quot; at least 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Still, there is an interesting point lost when retelling the ancient fairy tale.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why, in general, independent Scotland should carry out the orders of Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why change the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">These are the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally stopped.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With eurocrisis the Europe project is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In all European Union, the parties opposed to the EU or to cancel the euro as the single currency growth momentum.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the party of the F-word &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; — established only in this the year - coming from nowhere and received almost five million votes on September federal election, and in fact displacing &quot;the Free democrats&quot; (analog of ours of &quot;the Liberal democrats&quot;) from the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There was always an internal opposition to the plan to establish federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European central bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through maintaining the single currency led many people to believe that the European project gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The euro crisis has little to do with that national governments work at excessive budget deficits — it was only fair in Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In fact, the eurosystem blocked the members on the exchange rates enabling German exporters. then German politicians and want to save.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency Southern Europe appears in before disadvantage on manufacturing capabilities compared with Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only the remedy is — to cut salaries and public spending that is actively supported by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the current problems of the budget and monetary there is a deeper problem of productive abilities of Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of a package of measures on &quot;green&quot; energy, imposed by Brussels - code meaning subsidies of the French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - the European industry drew double for electricity four times more for gas than in the US.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It paralizuyushche adverse price terms as we saw in Greyndzhmuta.</seg>
		<seg id="26">No freezing salaries in the world will stop the crushing defeat of cheap shale gas of the US over the European petrochemical industry.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result was brewing rebellion, particularly in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and to put Paris on a par with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin does not need Paris, as in means of obtaining political legitimacy anymore, and has already imposed its own economic policies to Europe, leaving the devastated economy of France in distress.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result floor-right, speaking against the EU Marine Le Pen's party &quot;National front&quot; just won a crucial by-election, releasing the ruling party of the Socialists to third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;Front&quot; is the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of votes now — a timely warning to British labourists that it cannot be assumed that splits in the right will automatically affect in favour of the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What Le Pen with the newfound popularity among the French white working class does?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the elections to the EU next year to create the block in the European parliament against the EU and against the single currency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If. and it is very likely — parties opposed to the EU will receive support in these elections, such block will be able to reach for the first time a dominant position in the European parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here's my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something vague &quot;Europe (sovereign) nations&quot; that was encouraging to General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and some economies, dependent on it, can save the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I assume that Britain is removed from the project, hoping to approach with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates probable that Britain will go unnoticed by the cold Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In that situation, it leaves Scotland?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to become the region (in fact) to Small England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can protect their own economic interests, which means, in addition, to send Berlin and Brussels to devils.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed for more free European location, provided that we will keep the currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier to non-federated Europe of nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should consider repeat the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The government of the Scottish national Party in Scotland are — ironically — the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to the cuts in spending proposed (and implemented) the Labour chancellor of the exchequer Alistair Darling and the coalition of the Tories and liberal democrats that had arisen thereafter.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would now be ridiculous to Scotland to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="1">African American and Latin American girls generally reached puberty earlier than their white peers, show research.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are guilty</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity may be one of the starting mechanisms of early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend towards early sexual maturity is not so expressed at boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge — a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Whether the mother should be scared if her daughter vestiges of the mammary gland start emerge and raise pubic hair in 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American academy of pediatrics this week to Orlando, Florida, the children's endocrinologist Dr Paul Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend much time, soothing parents - typically, this does not mean rapid approach of a full sexual maturity&quot; — Kaplovitts said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor appear at girls before.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there was only a slight shift under the age of menarche (the first periods) in the past four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States middle age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;After the breast starting to mature, passes at least two to three years at menarche&quot; — Kaplovitts, who is also the author of the book &quot;Early puberty in girls said: how to cope with this widespread problem &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time — the most accurate check how puberty will progress.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Discussion that represents the actual puberty is, but it is considered &quot;premature&quot; when the breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process will be slowed or stopped — him that the pediatrician may carefully trace.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Faster progression can form the basis for analyses at an endocrinologist delete serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are procedures to delay early periods and to prevent another investigation: premature ageing of bones that could eventually lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, the level of development, growth and the emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psycho-social aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplovitts is careful with drugs, but acknowledges that &quot;suppress puberty can mitigate behavioural problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Other big problem is clear: parents just don't want their very young daughters had periods.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or even how will they cope with hygiene issues&quot; — Kaplovitts said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock&quot; — one woman at which daughter of periods began in 10 years recalls.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although there were signs and we talked about periods, it was not emotionally ready.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He came home from school frightened and upset that it first among the girlfriends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are a lot of advertised theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are guilty of milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">At boys - as in girls: puberty comes first.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplovitts argues that the foundation that has the most weight is an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat on the body with puberty terms.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other data support this conclusion, but there are a lot of other contributing factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country African American and Latin American girls generally reached puberty earlier than their white peers.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Around the world early puberty is influenced, most likely, by everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Still puzzle: Although boys have facial hair and on lobok appear at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as at girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors involved in the AARP conference confirmed the complexity of this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The emergence of spots and pubic hair meets even in infants and children of the nursery age.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We must be careful how we define true puberty&quot; — Dr. Lawrence Silverman, the children's endocrinologist in children's hospital of Goriyeb to Morristaun, New Jersey said.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the paediatrician how to speak with the child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;This may mean earlier than anticipated conversation&quot; — Kaplovitts explained.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls who bloom early, need a confirmation that even when that happens before put, this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The royal bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in the unit on currency transactions, according to information of two people familiar with the situation that is another confirmation that the global audit by regulators of the alleged manipulation in the currency market is increasing rapidly.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the investigations related to the world's largest financial market that daily turnover was $5.3 trillion.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The two traders will be the first employees of RBS discharged during the ensuing investigation, which echoes the scandal involving manipulating the inter-bank interest rate LIBOR.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Having refused to comment on discharges, the bank confirmed that this month it had received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;Our current investigate this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and our other regulators&quot; — reported in bank two weeks ago.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Last month, the insiders said that RBS transferred records of e-mail and instant messages that received and the former trader, to the regulator of Great Britain — to the Office for control of financial activities (FCA) sent him.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The trader, Richard achères, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, it was granted leave at its current position of the head of the European spot currency auction in JPMorgan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot auction in Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was suspended as Standard Chartered bank this week.</seg>
		<seg id="9">None of these traders were not accused of any violations.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The group of contacts of instant messages of Mr. achères included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the informed persons.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The UBS bank reported this week that it had taken action against some staff after the Swiss Finma regulator said that he investigates alleged manipulation in the currency market in several Swiss banks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At least six regulators in the world - the European commission, Finma, antitrust authority of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — believe allegations that bankers have conspired to influence the currency market.</seg>
		<seg id="13">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation, said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Banks view instant messages and emails for several years in search of cases of misconduct.</seg>
		<seg id="15">News about checks intensified traders in the field of activities that were in recent years, one of the largest sources of income for trading divisions of investment banks which this year, however, have had difficulty in view of the fact that low volatility of currencies reduces enabling opportunities for traders.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Some bankers tried to diminish the gravity of the situation, saying that the extensive and highly liquid currency market can almost be manipulated, but senior traders say it is not always right.</seg>
		<seg id="17">According to senior trader, despite the vast amount of daily auction in the currency market, fragmentation of liquidity among different trading platforms and greater use of the internal platforms by banks means that &quot;you can start affecting the market for very small price&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This news comes on the same day, when the Credit Suisse bank announced that dismissed one of traders of the department of the share auction of the London Stock Exchange this week after that caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The bank immediately notified relevant authorities and cooperates with the regulators.</seg>

		<seg id="1">When I was small, Halloween was magic.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Enabled us to eat sweets with his sister, late not to go to bed and position the masquerade for our area.</seg>
		<seg id="3">I now resemble the miser more.</seg>
		<seg id="4">I didn't volunteer to circulate in the past two years, candy in the apartment, and probably will not be and this year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the statistics show that I am a black sheep in relation to the Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="6">According to the National federation of retail, most Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and jewellery.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The only thing I wait for each Halloween — is trends.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The national federation of retail forecasts that on costumes $1.2 billion from the spent $6.9 billion will leave.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This year at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is not mandatory for women to be members of sexual professions anymore; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, burgers or carrot.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As for men, I think we will see many of the zombie thanks to &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and I am confident that astronauts in the style of Daft Punk group will get into our tapes Instagram this year.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Google, costumes that look for most often — it is a zombie, Bateman, pirates and witches.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We dressed up our dogs last year and to my surprise, we were not only.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Moreover, according to the National federation of retail, Americans will spend this year, $330 million for costumes for pets.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This means many funny dogs-hotdogov.</seg>
		<seg id="17">When it comes to sweets, we don't waste time with details.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Americans will spend on them $1.9 billion this year, according to the Nielsen company.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These are about 600 million pounds of chocolate of Hershey, candy, Milk Duds Candy, the Twizzlers chewing sweets and bars of Clarke Bar.</seg>
		<seg id="20">According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it is great news for 41 million requiring sweets of children who were going to submit our areas.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Moreover, we will buy and — we will not deceive ourselves — we will eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during the Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only thing that we don't want to uses - these are sweets in the form of corn seeds: and yet, according to the National association of confectioners, nearly 35 million their pounds are sold under the Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="23">These are about 9 billion individual corn kernels.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is a mystery that I still have to solve.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nothing can express Halloween essence as haunted houses.</seg>
		<seg id="26">They have amazing names, for example &quot;Horror behind walls&quot; (which, incidentally, is in the real prison), &quot;Howl also shout&quot; and &quot;The house of shock&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Moreover, according to society America Haunts, in America there are 1200 officially recognized haunted houses generating about $500 million income, as well as those amazing photos where you were almost described which your friend laid out on Facebook, and you can't clean, and then the guy who you love, sees this photo and leaves the commentary, it seems &quot;a cool look&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And finally, we'll talk about pumpkins.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Charlie Brown acquainted us with Great Pumpkin when we were children, and cutting the lamp of Jack — it as decoration of the Christmas tree, that we do from childhood.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fortunately for us, the fashion for the child in pumpkin began only last year, thanks to Pinterest so most of us grew, cutting out these pumpkins, but without sitting in them.</seg>
		<seg id="31">According to the U.S. Census bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Jack's lamp is slowly drying on your porch likely came from the State of Illinois, who grew up 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
		<seg id="33">If you want a more difficult task, visit Tim and Susan Metisdon in the city of Napa of the State of California and try to cut anything from their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds.</seg>

		<seg id="0">At pawnbrokers in Singapore things go well, while the middle class experiences difficulties</seg>
		<seg id="1">In a pawn shop in the mall Bendemir in Singapore janani Amirtkhalinga puts a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay school fees for his daughter.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;My husband and I just bought a house so all my money is invested there&quot; — ms. Amirtkhalinga says.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although she earns S $3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband too works, it is not enough monthly income of the family, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, demand — where the amount of debt of households grows in different parts of south-east Asia - is such that ValueMax where it executes a transaction, this week became the third Lombard registered on the stock exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The loan on the security of jewellery — it not only quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirtkhalinga) but also is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Usually pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% — slightly higher than 15.4% proposed in the office of United Overseas Bank, the local creditor with industry in the same shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, pawn shops have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or evidence of wages and could provide loans faster than banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Therefore, millions of people across the region address in pawnbrokers as families feel pressure because of the increase in the cost of living and rapid growth of debt of households and consumer debt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of sustained growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in developed economies, families grip low and average income in pawnbrokers to offset the decline of income in the process of slowing growth of their economies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, reported raising in the family credit shoulder, largely because of growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for solvency of Asian banks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of debt of households to gross domestic product in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia led the list of 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week hardly left technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday data showed a continued fall in exports and weakening of consumer demand.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The essence of that with an increase in prices people in the middle and lower part [the scale of income] will look for ways to supplement their income, where will only be able&quot; — tells Song Seng Woon, an economist at CIMB, Malaysian bank.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Record high prices of gold in the past two years strengthened haste with which people put their personal belongings as they take the opportunity to get money for the family jewellery.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore, some 70% of the things put in 200 lombard paragraphs of the city-state are gold products.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People say: &quot;Price of gold looks good, let's put a gold chain of grandmother and we'll get it back next month&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnbrokers of EasyMoney witnessed the growth of the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Growth in lombard business is such that ValueMax, operator of the office in Bendemire and 15 others same in Singapore, plans to extend not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia too, Yeakh Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax says.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will finance the extension, using 60 per cent from S $66 million attracted this week as a result of IPOs on stock exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some creditors led to criticism fired because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeakh said that the pawn shop not only offers cheaper fares than other creditors, it also does not increase the debt directly.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Customers put subjects they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households&quot; — she says.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The mortgage wins more and more public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, provided funding.</seg>
		<seg id="25">And thus use pawnbrokers not only the categories of people who are in dire financial straits.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Rich people in Singapore also use offices of ValueMax, putting gold bars or Rolex that can give to 60 per cent of their acquisition cost cash.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see clients from all sectors of society.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short term for commercial projects or investment, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary money problems&quot; — ms. Yeakh says.</seg>
		<seg id="29">They sometimes simply need money very quickly.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Black box at you in the car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">As American designers of roads try to find money to repair the scattered highway system, many are starting to see a decision in the small black box, which is clearly linked to the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">These devices tracking everyone proyezzhayemy the motorist mile and transferring this information to officers are at the centre of a controversial attempt to improve outdated system of funding of America's highways made by planners in Washington and staff.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Typically boring arena of planning of highways suddenly generated intense debate and picturesque alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying to ensure the right to use small boxes to the government to track number proyezzhayemy you miles, and perhaps even where you pass them - and uses then this information in making tax accounts.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Movement of tea drinking shocked.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American civil liberties union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And while congress cannot agree, continue yet, or not, some states are not going to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They reflect how over the next decade, you can switch to a system in which drivers pay for each mile of the road which they pass.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists already took these black boxes, some of which have function of satellite tracking on testing.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is necessary for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It is not an issue on which we can have an option&quot;, – Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of Governments of Southern California who is preparing plans at the first of track by the state government of miles, proyezzhayemy each California motorist, for 2025 said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be changes how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Technology for this purpose already are.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This need is compounded by the lack of funds at Government Fund for the construction of motorways funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Americans do not buy a lot of gasoline as before any more.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars are more miles on a gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, did not raise 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians don't want to impose a tax even one cent at the high price of petrol.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gas tax simply cannot be saved&quot;, – Lee Mannich, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In its staff has been found on cars of 500 tracking devices to test system of mileage payment recently.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;It will be the best alternative in the long term&quot;, – he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The Beggar call it a mileage user payment.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Unsurprisingly, this idea attracts urban liberals as through taxes it would be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce the burden of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Planners in California look closely at this system during develop strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of the state to combat global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (a republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of transport committee of the House, said he too believes the system as the most viable long-term option.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Supporters of the free market in Reason fund of also delighted that will force drivers to pay for every mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;It is not just a tax, which will go to a black hole&quot;, – Adrian Moore, vice president for political affairs of Reason said.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People directly pay for what they receive.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This movement is also supported by two former Ministers of Transport of us who in 2011 urged congress to move towards the mileage payment.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The U.S. senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million in which some 10,000 cars would take part last year.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of fears of the rural lawmakers representing voters who in everyday life often have to be many miles to get to work or to the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Some states and cities, however, go on this path independently.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon where to attend the largest experiment in the country 5000 drivers are involved.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will pay staff to run miles instead of a tax on gasoline soon.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Nevada a pilot project has already been completed.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In New York, it is considered.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois will test it on a limited basis involving trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the coalition of I-95, which includes transport departments of 17 states of the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studies as they will be able to implement these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This concept was not universally recognized.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers have recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can monitor each their step.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concern about &quot;the big brother&quot; and similar things represents a big problem&quot;, – Alauddin Khan managing questions of strategy and management of efficiency in department of transport of the State of Nevada told.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It was not that people wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When the test was at full speed, the office of the American civil liberties union in Nevada, warned on the website: &quot;It will be very simple to turn these devices into devices of full track&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to store records of daily movements of individual citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of several states where complex searches of low-cost technology that would allow authorities of the state to maintain account proyezzhayemy the car of miles, but without information about the place and time are ongoing.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you are able to do so, Khan said, society will feel more relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Searches of this technology has led some agencies of staff to the small young company in California entitled True kilometres.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Originally, the company was not responsible for assisting in the taxation of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She sought to enter the growing market for the type of car insurance at which drivers pay on the basis of escape.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But devices it tests, involve designers of the road because they don't use GPS and provide limited amount of information, periodically loaded via a modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People will be more inclined to do so if you do not track their speed and do not track their location&quot; — Ryan Morrison, executive director of True miles of travel said.</seg>
		<seg id="52">There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot programmes of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are far less expensive and less intrusive way to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon designers experiment providing various options to drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can select the device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they may refuse absolutely the device, having decided to pay rather than a fixed fee based on the average of miles, which is made by all residents of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="57">In other places hope to sell an idea of a wary public, forcing devices to do more, and it is not less.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York transport officials seek to develop the taxing device, which will also accept payment on parking meters, to ensure &quot;pay as you go&quot; insurance and collect a pool of speed data in real time from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists will be recruited by benefit which to them will be offered&quot; — it is told in the document of town-planning design.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some designers transportation systems, however, reflect on whether all the talk of mileage payment by simply enormous distraction is.</seg>
		<seg id="61">In the city transport commission in the area of the gulf San Francisco officials say the congress could overcome very simply bankruptcy of trust by the construction of roads, having raised taxes on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="62">The additional single or annual tax could be raised from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, which they paid their fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you need to do is — it to take aspirin&quot; — Randi Rentshler, the director of the commission on the legislation and the public relations told.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about her private life and a host of other things.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February</seg>
		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will embed the dignity of new cardinals of the Catholic church for the first time in his term of office on February 22 as said the Vatican on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Cardinals are senior clerics in the Catholic church after his father, and they elect fathers so Francis will appoint the first group of people who will participate ultimately to choose his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are currently 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, after age of 80 by Cardinal he could not take part in his father's elections, any more — it is the prerogative of a group of 120 &quot;cardinals-electors&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In announcing this news, the spokesman for the Vatican father Federico Lombardi said that before the construction ceremony in a dignity the meeting of all current cardinals known as the conshistory will be held.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis decided to report in advance of his decision to call a conshistory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from various corners of the world&quot; — Lombardi said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices organization said that by February, the number of cardinals-electors will probably decline.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He said that usually the father calls so many cardinals, how many it is necessary again to finish number of cardinals-electors to 120, and so many cardinals aged over 80 years, how many he would wish.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The conshistory next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis's election in March this year, according to Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the moment there is some kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new father of cardinals from other parts of the world to restore the balance will appoint&quot; — he said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In South America live forty per cent of Catholics, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It will also be the first elected cardinals since the establishment of cardinals by Francis Soveta — groups of eight cardinals from around the world, it is mandated to look for ways to reform the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past, the father decided all independently.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now Francis elected eight cardinals that they helped him&quot; — Valero said.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He said &quot;it is possible&quot; that Francis will contact cardinals for the council.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But we were not in this situation before — this for us for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said fathers bundled in the position of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis &quot;is full of surprises — therefore, we don't know who he would call&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The treasury implemented a preliminary assessment of the measure to a capital gains tax, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne who in the budget of 2012 introduced a rate of the state tax of 7% for homes worth over £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to their homes by association, but not as individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="2">At the moment, the state duty on residential real estate in the Areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea making 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year already exceeds total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humber combined.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Within the limits hosted presentation of the new production line of electric pipes from steel.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As commercial director of the company Denis Gribanov said, in 2011 with the advent of the new owner market study on the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region is under way.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It became clear that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of welded steel per month.</seg>
		<seg id="4">After that the decision to change the profile of the plant and installation on it of equipment for their products have been made.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This year, more than 7,000 tons of total production is shipped.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Investment in plant produced more than 120 million rubles, dzyanis Gribanov said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In October, the new camp that allows you to increase the range is launched.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the plant is being issued as a small profile of the pipe, which is used to hothouse, of small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and large - for the construction industry.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We plan to reach level of production of 50,000 tonnes of products a year that will be about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Despite the shift to other activity, the number of employees in the enterprise it was not reduced it now makes 157 people, in the plans when purchasing a new technology - increases in staff even by more than 50 employees.</seg>

		<seg id="12">Next year it is planned to introduce a new unit of the longitudinal became acute up to five millimetres thick that would reduce production costs, and another camp, with a speed of production of the pipe to 47 metres per minute.</seg>
		<seg id="13">By the end of 2014, the business is going to master production of pipes that are used in the housing and community services.</seg>

		<seg id="15">The deputy director of investment policies Leonid Ostroumov, referring to the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machinery industries.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Forms of public support for the industry, which include compensation of interest rates on loans to purchase new equipment and costs on its leasing are also aimed at it.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the current year is intended to provide the 150 million rubles for those goals, two thirds of that amount already spent.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The last commission, which will consider contracts of subsidies, accepts documents from businesses until 15 November.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In addition, the budget offsets the cost of attendance of local producers in the international fairs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Next year's budget provided means of 150 million rubles that can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans to purchase new equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="21">5 million will be allocated to participate in the fairs, 3 million - on energy-saving programs.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Drop to 72 million rubles of funds to compensate for an orderly and paid technology made in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.</seg>
		<seg id="23">According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the long term this form of support will stop as compensation for a tax on mining that oil companies paid in the regional budget was motive for its introduction.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Now they don't do it and subsidies become direct account the responsibilities of the region.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Accordingly, the government of region considered as a priority direct support of the industry, but not funding through them the oil industry.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The assistance of the budget will be associated with investment projects that will begin to be implemented on production.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Many heads of enterprises expressed concern about the situation in a relationship with oil workers.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The grant for equipment bought by them is competitive advantage of the industry in the South of the Tyumen region, and at its dissolution it would be difficult to compete on price with a central Russia, where cheaper labour.</seg>

		<seg id="4">According to a political analyst with The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by the senior officials of the campaign headquarters and the White house, namely, the former head of the administration of the White house Bill Daly, to assess what effect will have on vote appointment as Secretary of State Clinton vice-president.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Possible replacement was a secret, which is closely guarded in the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only six close advisers to the president - including Daly, a former head of the campaign headquarters of Obama Jim Messinu and former senior adviser to the White house David Axelrod; and David Pluff — knew that the replacement is considered.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The book &quot;The stakes Are Doubled&quot; claims that Daley was the initiator of trying to replace Biden, despite them &quot;a close personal relationship&quot; but eventually refused this step when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral list not &quot;will improve significantly Obama's chances&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration really considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I actively supported the multitude of things, and it was one of them&quot; — Daley told the newspaper.</seg>
		<seg id="10">You have to remember that at that point, the president was in a terrible form so we thought: &quot;Oh God, what to do to us? &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">While Daley described research as &quot;necessary verification&quot;, Martin said the representative of CNN Anderson to Cooper that the election headquarters attached to study of quite a lot whether will bring this step dividends on the vote.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;The election headquarters don't spend such sums of money to surveys and focus groups if they do not believe anything seriously&quot; — Martin in the programme of joint stock company 360 said.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It is not clear, however, Obama knew that his team studied the possibility of replacement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Martin told CNN that he had asked Daly, if the boss of the time knew him about a possible reshuffle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">While Daley also said that he did not think the president &quot;was aware&quot; for a possible replacement, former head of the administration acknowledged that, &quot;probably&quot;, Obama knew.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Martin added that &quot;the stakes are doubled&quot; does not provide a clear answer to question whether the outcome of the political sounding reached Obama's desk.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Cooper asked Martin whether seriously he believes that Obama did not know about research able to exclude Biden from the electoral roll.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Probably&quot; — Martin replied.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Russian brewers have a bad mood.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On their estimations, consumption of beer in the country next year is stagnant, and it at best.</seg>
		<seg id="3">While entrepreneurs had originally relied on growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">After all this year is developing for them failed: sales fell to 7 per cent.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The head of one of the largest breweries of the country, the chairman of the board of the Union of Russian pivovarov Isaac Sheps at the third annual conference of the Institute of Adam Smith said &quot;everyday necessities in Russia&quot; which just ended in Moscow of all this.</seg>
		<seg id="6">On it discussed state regulation of the market.</seg>
		<seg id="7">From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already been reduced by 18 per cent as in recent years in the country significant strengthening regulation of the brewing industry for the production and trafficking of beer - drink with a small alcohol content is respected, said to the audience of Sheps.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In one country in the world there is no such tight restrictions on the beer market, unpredictable introduction all the new and new illogical ban which settle allegedly combat alcohol abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The brewer, complained that many legislative ban designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse has no special effects, however constantly there are all new initiatives.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Most painfully on beer manufacturers struck the ban imposed from this year to sell alcohol in the stalls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;We lost immediately 35 thousand consumers&quot;, - Isaac Sheps said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Next year at pivovarov two forecasts.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The optimistic - what said Sheps: sales of foam drink will remain intact.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The pessimistic - will fall to 2-3 per cent.</seg>
		<seg id="15">To maintain their profits, entrepreneurs are forced to go from the classes calculated on the mass consumer to class &quot;premium&quot;: beer will become less, but it will be more expensive.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile, radical effect by falling sales with a small quantity of alcohol, it is not visible.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;In my experience, the level of diseases of alcoholism is about the same - the narcologist Alexei Sotnikov reported.</seg>
		<seg id="18">However, the proportion of patients using substitutes for strong drinks, as well as those who &quot;sat down&quot; on alcohol-based tonics like &quot;Jaguar&quot; while &quot;beer&quot; alcoholism prevailed about 10 years ago grew.</seg>

		<seg id="0">To what will give the construction of TPU in Moscow</seg>
		<seg id="1">Each year the city authorities promise to equip more and more transport and inter-station passage (ttco).</seg>
		<seg id="2">Until 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Than in practice, the project is wrapped, our correspondent understood.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A couple of months ago the Smolensk subways in the Arbat and pokrovsky line was the construction fence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The caption read that there is the location of transport and transfer site.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It was all very strange as near &quot;Smolensk&quot; no land transport stops and, therefore, you cannot change on it.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To reach the nearest trolley bus stop on the Garden ring, it is necessary to overcome some 130 metres, including land transition through Karmanitsky Lane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now at &quot;Smolensk&quot; almost everything is over.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The flower stall disappeared, stand for newspapers have been dismantled, and asphalt before entering was replaced by a stone blocks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Here and all transport hub.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Transport and inter-station passage happen plane and capital - explain in the press-service of capital the department of transport.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Capital TPU are not yet.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And plane assume the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of the trade objects alarming to the movement of passengers, the establishment of small architectural forms and improvement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In fact, not even transport workers, and professional blagoustroitel from the department of major repairs of the city of Moscow are engaged in plane TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The transport hub it is not necessarily a complex design - is explained by the director of the Institute of transport economy and transport policy of Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Sometimes the homeless and boards notifying on transport arrival time is sufficient.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here, for example, at the Yasenevo Metro opened quite full plane transfer site recently.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Let without lights, but with the captures car parks and boards indicating when the bus will come.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But in pursuit of number officials write to TPU everything that every possible thing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In 2011, the mayor planned to build for everything about all 151 nodes, of them 59 with capital construction.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Now in plans until 2020 reappear 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Of those, one hundred and fifty is promised to hand over this year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Although the city, there is a programme of development of TPU, is not identified any qualitative criteria, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization &quot;City and Transport&quot; states.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Report by the number of objects, but the quality of change on each of them often deteriorating.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first - speed of change, second, convenience.</seg>
		<seg id="26">First of all able to replace a mode of transport, without leaving under the rain.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Moscow at location of TPU sometimes leaves rivno on the contrary.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Vivid example of the subway &quot;ENEA&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Earlier suburban buses from Yaroslavskoye Highway came to the square before the main entrance of the OCE.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Now their stops moved to the opposite side of the Resident of Yaroslavl on Kosmonavtov Street.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Farther from the subway, much farther from the monorail, but is closer to homes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Although residents did not want bus station under windows at all and complained to all possible instances.</seg>
		<seg id="33">With capital TPU in Moscow somehow immediately it was not specified.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The first of them began to be built at the Glider Metro about five years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The project was intended to be exemplary.</seg>
		<seg id="36">And indeed the tale of how the transfer site assigned to investors turns into banal shopping centre happened.</seg>
		<seg id="37">No, there are platforms for buses, the awning here not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.</seg>
		<seg id="38">However, for the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU room was not made substantially.</seg>
		<seg id="39">They as strangers were removed away from the Metro.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But places under trade remained more.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Only one clothing 32 stores, and in general are almost everything from zoogoods to a motor show.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Well indeed, suddenly who from bus passengers want to buy on the way the new car?</seg>
		<seg id="43">At us when build capital TPU, for some reason the shopping centre always is produced.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion when part of parking was agreed to be given to the market.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Now on the third floor of TPU &quot;Glider&quot; among the parking spaces marked on the floor there is a lively trade.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The vegetables, spices, the Chinese jeans, the non-russian speech and security guards who are maliciously glancing at our photographer.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The move site eventually turned into a market.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The fact is that earlier the Glider Metro had a market, but it was born.</seg>
		<seg id="49">And in prefecture of dealers regretted and let on the captures parking of transfer site.</seg>
		<seg id="50">All the same because of high prices it is always empty there.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The most ridiculous that demolished the market to build on its place... new plane TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Such here castling.</seg>
		<seg id="53">At the Kaluga Metro the approach distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 metres, Alexander Morozov said.</seg>
		<seg id="54">After the construction of shopping centre, allegedly TPU, distance, increased to 170 metres.</seg>
		<seg id="55">To embark on a bus, you must go through all shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After 22 hours when it is closed, it is necessary to bypass in the open air.</seg>
		<seg id="57">However, designs on &quot;Glider&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot; will seem florets soon.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In the middle of September, the urban planning and land commission of the city hall approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Four of them will be 25-story, apart from two or three underground circles.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The main monster will grow at the tushinskiy subway, there shall be 418.7 sq.m. of the area.</seg>
		<seg id="61">The representatives of the Office of Rail stations of the Russian Railway that are responsible for building TPU at Subway have said journalists: in future high-rise buildings shops, hotels and apartments will settle down.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Thus officials assure that multilayered parking spaces will borrow from one-third to one-half of the area.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Let's take an example &quot;national&quot; garages.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Let's say, garage that man 258 parking spaces, which was built on Mezhdunarodnaya Street recently, has an area of 8015 sq.m.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Funds, parking by 2.6 thousand cars at &quot;Petrovsky and Razumovskaya&quot; requires some 80,000 of &quot;squares&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="66">It is less than a third of that large object that is going to be built there.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Let one or two floors will go to any platforms for buses.</seg>
		<seg id="68">There are at least 150,000 sq.m. commercial real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="69">And it, for a minute, almost two ghuma.</seg>
		<seg id="70">If capital TPU at stations and train stations are built by railway workers, other platforms will be spent by metropolitenovets.</seg>
		<seg id="71">They also promised that there will be many &quot;objects of functional purpose&quot;, including hotels, offices and even sports hall.</seg>
		<seg id="72">Incidentally, in the department of property of the city of Moscow recently said to reporters that develop a draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply for a site for TPU to officials directly.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Without any competitions.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Therefore supposedly that transport issues for the city is a priority.</seg>
		<seg id="75">Ideal TPU is, for example, Harvard stations in Boston or &quot;Spadayna&quot; in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is sure.</seg>
		<seg id="76">There trolleys and trams go down under the land on the level of the Metro and distance of approach from the subway car to the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Around any excess trade.</seg>
		<seg id="78">But throws the Moscow officials into extremes.</seg>
		<seg id="79">Or we will build anything, or otgrokhay 25 storeys with offices and apartments.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The profit of Bombardier decreases with the fall of supply and number of orders for aircraft</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Bombardier corporation, the Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, reported on Thursday about reduced net profit for 15 per cent under the influence of the decreased number of orders and deliveries of planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Bombardier company located in Montreal also did not publish any data on flight tests of its latest CSeries plane and did not provide new information on, whether ambitious plans for introduction of the plane to commercial operation by next September will be implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, it took three more time that raises questions of whether the testing phase is progressing on schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results did not justify forecasts and led to the fall of action for more than 8 per cent at Toronto Stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doyerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday, the assessment with &quot;above average market&quot; to &quot;average market&quot; because of the belief that growth for action is limited in the next quarter or two.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Although weakening in the number of supply of aircraft was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the returns of the transport department&quot; — Doyerksen in a review of the stock market said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will generate more business for CSeries in the process of continuation of the programme of flight tests.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, if in the coming months, it is not announced new orders, we assume that the market will begin to be sceptical about the programme more.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the family of the CSeries aircraft will enable it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March and for the first time circled in September after months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But so far there is little firm orders for CSeries — 177 as potential buyers await the outcome of flight tests to verify allegations of the company about fuel efficiency and earnings potential of the new aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In total there are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The chief executive officer Pierre Bodoin was confident that Bombardier will achieve the object of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane has been put into commercial operation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday heads also assured analysts and media that the programme is progressing according to plan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test model of the plane did not remain on the ground longer than expected&quot; — Boduan during a conference call said, adding that ground testing and software updates were scheduled for downtime of the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="16">All producers plan tests differently.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We decided to conduct the first flight and to make a break for updates, so we and came.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Will happen so throughout the programme of flight tests.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test samples must make flight in the coming weeks and all others will soon follow it as the company reported.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Yet analysts are sceptical that the first client will be able to start operation of the CSeries plane in 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said that it evaluates the vintage and will provide new information in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slow rate of flight tests - although is likely also in line with the domestic schedule of Bombardier - supports our view that commissioning would be postponed for the first quarter of 2015&quot; — Doyerksen said.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter ended September 30 net income of Bombardier was reduced to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The adjusted earnings per share remained the same — 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The gross revenue declined slightly — from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts expected profit of 10 cents per share and the gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth in the world in size the manufacturer of aircraft reported that he put 45 aircraft in the quarter which is less than the figure for previous the year - 57.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The portfolio of aerospace division was $32.9 billion at September 30, without having changed since 31 December.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In aerospace results area responded to our goal, but the small number of incoming orders and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor&quot; — Boduan said.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The gross income in the aerospace direction fell to 13 per cent — to $2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest producer of trains, reported that the gross income in the sector grew by nearly 11 per cent — to $2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The portfolio in the transport division was $32.6 billion at September 30 that is slightly higher than the figure of 31 December.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Problems with the execution of several major contracts negatively affected the revenues of transport division.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The office said that in the fourth quarter of a new development plan will be presented.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Shares of the company of Bombardier, which also said that the chief financial officer on Google Patrick Pichett will be on the board of directors, fell to 8.5 per cent — to С $4.83 traded in the middle of Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third in the world in size commercial producer of planes and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, reported on Thursday on how to reduce the quarterly earnings by 10 per cent.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Two members of YMCA are accused of sexual offences, even before the charges against Jonathan Lord as the Royal commission knew</seg>
		<seg id="1">Two members of YMCA NSW were accused of sexual offences against children before bringing charges in 2011 against employee of the facility on childcare in Karingbakh of Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal commission on child sexual abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But in an opening statement of the commission stated that it &quot;never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse in the organization&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The chief executive officer Philippe Hare was asked about one case where an employee of YMCA was charged with offences relating to child pornography and the other case where the instructor at the gym in YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children who were under its supervision in 1991.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mr. Hare said Gale Ferness, to the counsel assisting the commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He acknowledged that YMCA in opening remarks to the commission also allowed inaccuracy, arguing that &quot;there were external audits of YMCA, which recognized that YMCA was on the safety of children in the forefront&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The submitted commissions of the certificate say that YMCA was informed that he received a second since the end of the four possible rankings as a result of auditing quality performed by the Department of Education and communities in August this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr. Hare who entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that he and a subordinate office provided a miss by hiring the Lord, and could not provide a clear understanding with the staff of the commitments to reporting breaches of security policy of children.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys within two years of his work in YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was imprisoned for at least six years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that corporate ethics YMCA prevented staff to report violations of the Lord in the area of safety of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Staff testified that they observed violations, including that the Lord was alone with children, personally looked after them, put them herself on knees, said that he loves one of them and allow them to play a mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Daniel Okvell, which was under the direction of Lorda and asked to teach him in the protection of children because she was concerned about his behaviour, showed that found Jackie Barnat, the care manager over children of the office of YMCA in Karingbakh, which was the head Lorda, &quot;very frightening and often remote&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The executive director said that he does not accept an explanation of staff that it was embarrassing for them to report on the situation to the supervisors.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord took them away from the thought of the need to report him.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hare said that he submitted to the council of YMCA of New South Wales, the view that the lesson for the organization from &quot;incident with Jonathan Lord&quot; not &quot;concerns reporting&quot; from staff, and the council agreed with him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr. Hare said the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the emergence of charges was made by the Director-General of the YMCA on child custody Liam Whitley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said it was designed to prevent damage to the evidence, but &quot;were overdo it&quot; and this decision poorly implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="18">YMCA of New South Wales was not the organization, safe for children, in operating time of Jonathan Lord it between 2009 and 2011, an expert on issues of corruption of children professor Stephen Smolboun from Griffith University reported the commissions.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; at a set, selection, coaching, staff training and control of it.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Hearings were postponed until 20 December.</seg>
