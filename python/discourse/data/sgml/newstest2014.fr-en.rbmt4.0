		<seg id="0">The business NSA underlines the total absence of debate on the information</seg>
		<seg id="1">How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which of one quoted upsets itself in public convoking the ambassador of the United States on October 21st, and of the other one forbidden the browsing of the territory by the Bolivian presidential airplane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence to his edge of Edward Snowden?</seg>
		<seg id="2">According to me, there are two levels of reply on behalf of the French government.</seg>
		<seg id="3">While François Hollande phones Barack Obama or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius convokes the ambassador of the United States, they react to a true discovery, which is that of the extent of the American surveillance on the unity of the communications in France.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It is not amazing of on the one hand reading the reproduction of the diplomatic correspondence American and of other in the columns of the World at some weeks of space part a conviction of the listenings of the Quay of Orsay by the NSA?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Would it not be as a vague hypocrisy of your part</seg>
		<seg id="6">The journalistic move is not a moral positioning, but the research of the interest and of the pertinence of information that allow every citizen to build up an opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">While WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by the American diplomacy of political or other stakes in the whole world, we consider indeed that, with regard to the American power, that constitutes an important lighting.</seg>
		<seg id="8">While we describe the American systems of interception contrary to the French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any case to incense us of this practice, it is to describe the such world that it is.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Has France benefited from information supplied by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aiming our interests?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Can one do without the American collaboration?</seg>
		<seg id="11">The arrangement for roughly ten years of technological tools of interception very powerful by the United States, but also by France, officially has been justified by the fight against the terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moreover, in this domain, France and the United States notably have put in place of the procedures of cooperation and of almost daily exchanges of information and that are described of part and of other as main parts.</seg>
		<seg id="13">A Titre D'exemple, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal zones at Miranshah has been signaled to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="14">France can be driven, for example, to transmit whole blocks from data on the region of the Sahel to the American services, and, in equivalent - one has already rapidly said it -, the Americans can give information to the French on other regions of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Therefore the question of bottom behind this business NSA is not the capacity or the right of the countries of endowing itself of tools of interception, as well as the question of the total absence of preliminary debate, notably within the Parliaments, on the justification such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, after all, the question of the attacks on the freedoms.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That risk really the United States? a degradation of their picture?</seg>
		<seg id="17">One has beautiful to denounce them, I do not see in what way they will be able to be punished.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The risk run by the Americans can be double.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The first, it is while their allies - and that has been the case lately - learn that their leaders, sometimes to the highest summit of their State, have been watched.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is the case of Brazil and of Germany, two countries where the diplomatic relationships with the United States are tightened themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Another effect can be it more economic: more and more European or sud-américaines firms balk, in the light of the revelations, at entrusting their confidential data to American recipients subjected to the American laws, and therefore to the hold of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Last element: the vast movement of revelations engaged by media of the whole world, which contributes to engage a debate on the practices of surveillance of the services of information until then practically non-existent, could drive to the legislators, including American, to reconsider the powers that they have given to their services of information.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking</seg>
		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that one takes a cigarette to smoke.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Only one dose of the vaccine has been able to protect for life mice from the dependence at the nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Other tests are necessary before beginning the testings on the human being, but the Teacher Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York has declared that the first signs were encouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="4">«We hope really that this kind of vaccinial strategy will be able to help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods today available on the market, but discover that their addiction is sufficiently strong to surmount these different approaches», has declared the Teacher Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information necessary to conceive anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus infects in a selective way the cells of the liver, which begins then to cause a regular flood of antibody.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies track down all the present molecules of nicotine in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, what prevents the smoker from having his dose of nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="8">During the tests, the vaccinated mice to whom one has given afterwards nicotine have pursued their activity in a normal way.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But the mice that had not been vaccinated «were appeased», have declared the researchers, sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The experiences are described in the review Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The previous vaccines against the tobacco have proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The injections had to be repeated so frequently so that the levels of antibody remain high that they were too expensive and little practical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine should be pretty inferior because it transforms the cells of the liver into factories at antibody.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Teacher Crystal has declared that if the future vaccine to human use was completely safe, one could administer it to the children before they are tempted of trying a cigarette, what would prevent every addiction to the nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more probable that it is used by the smokers who want to stop smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">«They will know that if they start to smoking again, they will not take any pleasure because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will be able to help them to lose their bad habit», it has added.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists have declared that the results were interesting but they have notified that well more deepened investigations were necessary.</seg>

		<seg id="21">The statutory power regarding the portable telephones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The FAA can raise the ban on some electronic devices during the takeoff and the landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National one Transportation Safety Board, national expert in safety of the transports on CBS News, has declared that the portable telephones always were considered as presenting a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">«The portable telephones are truly a problem, not only because could they possibly create interferences with the instruments of navigation, but because we know, of after the FCC, who they could disrupt the antennae-intermediary of mobile telephony if they are used aboard,» has declared Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the problem has recommended the last month that the government authorizes a broader use of the personal electronic devices</seg>
		<seg id="26">The pressure weighing on the FAA has been reinforced in the course of the last years to loosen the restrictions regarding their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Of the detractors such as the sénatrice Claire McCaskill, D-Mb., maintain that there is not any reason of valid safety for these bans.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions are also more and more difficult to apply because the use of the devices has become omnipresent.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers forget to switch off their devices or make it deliberately.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA has started limiting the use of the electronic devices in 1996 with reference to the relations on the presence of interferences with the instruments of navigation and of communication while the passengers transported radios FM, the high-tech gizmo of then.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The new airliners depend much more on the electric systems than the previous generations of airplanes, but they are also conceived to resist the electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airlines allow their passengers to use the Wi-Fi at the altitudes of cruise for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Had modified them to receive systems Wi-Fi resist also better to the interferences.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of airliners should allow a broader use of the electronic devices in accordance with the directive news, has declared Huerta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The electronic devices of today produce in general transmissions radio of power well weaker than the previous generations of devices</seg>
		<seg id="36">The readers of electronic books, for example, express only minimal transmissions while one turns a page.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the transmissions are stronger while the devices load or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Amazon.com is part of those that make of the electronic devices pressure for a softening of the restrictions regarding the use by the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, the leaders of the society have loaded an airliner of readers with electronic books Kindle and have made it to fly to see if there were problems, but there has not been any.</seg>
		<seg id="40">That has inspired the members of the advisory committee of the FAA feelings mitigated as for the question of knowing if the use of the devices presents or not a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd de la National Association of Airline Passengers has declared that he thought that the interferences coming from the devices were real, even if the risk was minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other members of the committee have declared that there are only anecdotal relations emanating of pilots who indicate that the devices can interfere with the systems of an airplane, and that most of them are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Though, the committee has recommended that the FAA allows to the pilots to ask the passengers to switch off their devices during the landings to the instruments in conditions of weak visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group of the industry of the journey has congratulated of the changes, calling them of the arrangements full of common sense for travellers equipped with technologies.</seg>
		<seg id="45">«We are happy that the FAA admits that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with the safety», has declared Roger Dow, President and manager of the U. S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="2">«We want» the peace «to come back; we want of the stability », has declared Vanessa of Sousa, general manager of an investment company.</seg>

		<seg id="4">For two weeks, virtually every day of the relations stating conflicts between the governmental strengths and the Renamo, the worst collisions from the agreement of peace that was signed more than 20 years ago, has been.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Renamo was in the past a famous rebellious movement, supported to the departure by the Rhodésie governed by whites then the government of apartheid of South Africa within the framework of the efforts to destabilize the government independent from the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After an agreement of peace signed in 1992, it has become a party of opposition.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The analysts think that the country should not fall in a conflict open, but the recent events have shaken the foreign investors and the local population.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stake is sizeable for the economics in full growth since the discovery of enormous reserves of offshore gas and of deposits of coal in the north-west could attract more than 50 Md$ of investments in the course of the next years coming from societies as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brésil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko des États-Unis.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Frelimo, the party to the power and the main political strength for 1975, and the Renamo throw back mutually the responsibility of the tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Renamo declares that the government is at the origin of the recent confrontations and that it has launched an attack on his members to the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo, on October 17th.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The assaults on the previous rebels have then degenerated while the governmental strengths have attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government makes the Renamo responsible for having started the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The president Armando Guebuza has tried to minimize the anxieties regarding the instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">M. Guebuza has declared Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself as a «loser» that wanted to use« all the strengths that it remained it to try to prove that it could impose his decisions to the government».</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Frelimo and the Renamo insist to say that they wish for all two to avoid the war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the anxiety has grown after Mr. Mazanga has declared that the Renamo abandoned the agreement of peace of 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He has declared to the FT that it meant that the agreement was not anymore respected by the Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">«We want to recover the negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness», has indicated Mr. Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The previous discussions between the parts have not succeeded in appeasing the tensions fed by a series of conflicts this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">«It is not two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that do not stop quarreling», has explained Joseph Hanlon, one speaker of the open university and specialist in Mozambique.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them knows to negotiate well and none of them is ready to make the concessions necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The Renamo, who is in favor of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the local elections in front of taking place in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The presidential and legislative elections are foreseen next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted his use of the strength as the attempt of an ill movement of obtaining concessions and a treasure of war on behalf of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The part of the votes gathered by the Renamo does not stop lowering for 1992, while a new party, the democratic Movement of the Mozambique (MDM) that was created by a previous member of the Renamo, should obtain a greater number from votes to the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">M. Mazanga has said that Mr. Guebuza – that should retire at the end of his second mandate next year – wanted to destroy the democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">«It does not want of a multipartite democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want the peace because he does not want to leave the presidency», has declared Mr. Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">One does not know exactly what is the capacity of the Renamo, but it has led attacks lightning troublemakers on the police stations of police and the vehicles on a freeway axis major north-south.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the collisions have taken place in the province of Sofala, which is situated at several hundred kilometers to the north of Maputo, but where Beira, the port from where the mining societies notably Rio Tinto and Vale, export the coal, is.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio no more has been able to use the railroad during about a week after the Renamo has threatened to attack the railroad line.</seg>
		<seg id="31">M. Mazanga was fakely shy while one has asked to him if the Renamo réitèrerait this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The Renamo wanted «to warn the international community of the things not being fine in Mozambique», has indicated Mr. Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability has reinforced the frustrations that the government arouses, declares Fernando Lima, manager of Mediacoop, an independent society of media, of numerous people being also worried by the corruption, the slowness of the development and the recent wave of kidnappings</seg>
		<seg id="34">«The people think that the persons in charge of the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is last to it to take on solutions to the problems», it has explained.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, has said that the people wanted only stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">«Nobody cares about the Renamo or about the Frelimo, they want just to find the peace, they want to have a free access to the roads», it has added.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Dr Bwelle and his team spend nearly all their weekends to see hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are not many doctors in this country of western Africa, hardly 1 for 5 000 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or via your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Heroes CNN of the year 2013.</seg>

		<seg id="7">This person will receive 250 000 $ to pursue his extraordinary work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle has watched his ill father alternate the periods of conscience and of unconsciousness and to go to hospitals that were not equipped to come it helps some.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle has been hurt in a car accident in 1981 close to Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Initially, it has had only a broken arm, but it has contracted an infection that has spread up to his brain, creating a hematoma of which it was going to carry the after-effects the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">«There were not neurosurgeons in Cameroon», he has declared Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have taken it abroad if we had had enough money</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead of that, Dr Bwelle has spent years to accompany his father to clinics and hospitals filled, so that it obtains any treatment that he could benefit from.</seg>
		<seg id="14">«It is not easy», adds Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can leave the house at 5 hr, to dash to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">People can long die because they wait too much.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation has much not changed the father of Dr Bwelle in 2002 from the death.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As comparison, the ratio in the United States is d'1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if they could see a doctor, numerous Cameroonians could not pay the consultation.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two people on five in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the expenses of health of the country are realized in the private sector.</seg>
		<seg id="23">«The only problem that they have, it is the poverty», has explained Dr Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And because of the poverty, they can not take advantage of the life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">After having seen his father and as much of his compatriots to suffer, Dr Bwelle was urged to try to change the lesson from the things.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of voluntary have practised more than 700 surgical acts for free in the course of the last year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He has become doctor itself working as vascular surgeon to the central hospital of Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And it has created a humanitarian association to not lucrative goal, ASCOVIME, that makes itself rural in the zones for the weekends to dispense free care of health.</seg>
		<seg id="29">For 2008, it and his group of voluntary have helped close to 32 000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Nearly every Friday, with thirty people, they are piled in vans after having set the medical material on the roof and cross difficult grounds to go to the villages that need the more help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The luck does always not follow them.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They have many times owed to move the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But while they happen, they are received in hero: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available accommodations.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, the free care of health is a good reason of making the party, and Dr Bwelle – with his great smile and his bursting energy – is more than happy to be joined with the festivities.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The day after morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">«We receive 500 people to every visit», has declared Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They live sometimes at 60 km of the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In this itinerant, diverse hospital care of health is given.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Numerous people receive a treatment against the malaria, the tuberculosis, the malnutrition, the diabetes, the parasites and the sexually transmissible illnesses.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others can receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – document necessary to go to the school, but numerous poor families can not quite simply not to allow to itself to buy it.</seg>
		<seg id="41">The night, the team practises simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations are in general practised in a school, a town hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave the next person his place</seg>
		<seg id="43">Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the material, Dr Bwelle and her voluntary work until the first hours of the Sunday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is a rhythm tiring out, but the musicians of the villages help in general the team to remain justified.</seg>
		<seg id="45">«They knock on drums all night to keep ourselves bright so that we can continue work, has explained Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On the Sunday, the team returns downtown, tired but proud of the work that she has fulfilled.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group, compound of Cameroonian doctors and of students in medicine, has practised 700 surgical acts for free in the course of the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those at whom they come in aid.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man has explained that the free operation that it had undergone to look after a hernia would allow him to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">«That is going to change my future and that of my family», has declared the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In more of making to live this itinerant hospital and of working as surgeon to the hospital, Dr Bwelle also works the night in medical office deprived around Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It is this second job it explains, who finances his association to 60 %; the rest is covered by private gifts.</seg>
		<seg id="52">«I do not know when he sleeps», has declared Katie O'Malley, a student in medicine in second year of the university Drexel to Philadelphie and voluntary within the group of Dr Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="53">It is always in the hospital or at trying to take on money for his association in order to be able to lead these campaigns</seg>
		<seg id="54">For the students in medicine and the nurse students as Katie O'Malley, who come of the United States and of Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it is not an occasion of apprenticeship on the ground that they do not have at their places.</seg>
		<seg id="55">«One has been able to participate in operations to help Bwelle to absorb the blood or to make the instruments to the Dr pass», has explained Miss O'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">It is not something that you have the occasion of making in America while you are étudiant in medicine in second year.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The voluntary students pay in general their journey up to Cameroon, and arrive often with collected medical material.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But a time in Yaounde, their pension, their transport and the education are taken in charge by the doctor Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">«He is a hero, there is not doubt», has declared Katie O'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">It gives his life for this association, and his desire of helping the Cameroonian people is not close to dying away.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Dr Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.</seg>
		<seg id="62">To help the others to live happy holding his father the promise that it has made is something that brings him an immense joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">«I am so happy when I do this work», has added Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think about my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope that he sees what I make.</seg>
		<seg id="66">To make the people laugh and to relieve the pain is the reasons that drive me to make that.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Perplexed, the academics have long toiled to define and to situate Pierre Nora.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Teacher in the amphitheaters and the rooms of lesson</seg>
		<seg id="3">No doubt, but underlining her weak for the paths of strut, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Arbitrate works of others in his office of the street Gaston-Gallimard?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Heir of the armchair that Fontenelle to the French Academy occupied?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Indeed still, but knowing that such a curses would not know to replace the real holy oil, that of the thesis, which he has managed without.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Gladly they have recognized in it a great éveilleur, animator and federative of their works, but making to observe that it appeared little prone to produce some itself</seg>
		<seg id="9">In this uncertain image the monument of the &quot;places of memory&quot; has also contributed, which it has attached his name to.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The spiteful languages have been able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a lively glance and ballasted with erudition, but incurably dilettante.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The two works published by Nora these are is you are soon two years have already established that the one that went by not to write had a lot and well written.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The book that these are is you are should give him back definitively justice</seg>
		<seg id="13">One finds nevertheless, a time more, the temptation of the ubiquity, the intellectual wandering, the jubilation put to jump as to joined feet of a subject to the other one.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But one understands in a fast way that the mixed objects gathered in this book to the so beautiful title bring back the second-hand goods dealer to an only and same passion: that of discovering the knot constituent of the French identity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Why these dramatic calls singly national?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Identity: it is a worry of time.</seg>
		<seg id="17">These are is you are little, collectively we have been urged to give a definition.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But in the peremptory mind of our leaders of then, the French identity was a timeless gasoline</seg>
		<seg id="19">It was needed only to deploy the accidents, and the business Jacobinism obliges, the prefects and the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters, was entrusted.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The one that Pierre Nora tracks down is very other.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It does not land in heir of an eternal Frenchness, the definition rejects it</seg>
		<seg id="22">Analyst worried at a familiar strangeness, it wanders in a forest of symbols, order to every step by an object in the form of rebus, tortured of irritating questions.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Of which this, who is born of the firm itself why, in a country so lastingly installed in his borders so anciently carpentered and solidly built, one hears these dramatic calls singly?</seg>
		<seg id="24">They are not so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, only to beseech the confusion born of the discords of the French history</seg>
		<seg id="25">Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the strengths of division, here, are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="26">And the most emblematic is evidently the one that cracks in two the national history</seg>
		<seg id="27">As from the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, the one monarchical, the other revolutionary.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The second has wanted the death of the first, but without managing to deny it; concerned contrary to finding the sacralité and all the more eager for unity and for indivisibility that it had cut the head to the one that was the evident and powerful incarnation.</seg>
		<seg id="29">And, of there, an invincibly binary nation, shared between left and right, secularity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To make this singularity of the French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so well that the American trip of Pierre Nora well could be the heart of his book.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Because America and France have one and the other one made a revolution, written a declaration of the rights, wanted to found a new society</seg>
		<seg id="32">But the American cousinhood made better only underline what is us own.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Over there, men who had left their Ancien Régime in England and did not have anymore to care about it.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Here, men burdened with a native Ancien Régime, and all the more radical.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There a consensual revolution when here it has sown the drama and the conserved one.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There of the always honored founder fathers, and here of the revolutionary ancestors of whom one toils to make models, and that are itself of the rest killed.</seg>
		<seg id="37">There an institutional constancy, and here a waterfall of constitutions, as as many mistakes to recover and testings to recover.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The France that goes away, the France that comes</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless a time where the French have believed ago being able to sew up the torn dress of their history again, and defeating the curse of the number two.</seg>
		<seg id="40">To this III Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora has shown a lot of interest and even of tenderness: greeting those that have then applied themselves to making up for the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolboys all what in the old France prepared the modern France darkly and proposing them a unified version of their history</seg>
		<seg id="41">But this pacified identity has had only a time</seg>
		<seg id="42">The these are is you are again discusses it, jostled by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the ascent of revendicatives minorities, absorbed in the European space.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The book offers therefore at the same time the portrait fascinating from France who goes away and the circumspect sketch of the France that comes.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With, in bonus, the portrait of the historian, that should reserve some surprises.</seg>
		<seg id="45">One discovers that the vagrant was a homebody.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The man of the numerous curiosities turned around a same idea, lightly obsessional.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The prowler of edges stood at the center of the center.</seg>
		<seg id="48">And the one that had testified, these are is you are more than one demi-siècle, a subject on the idea of nation, but had shirked the initiatory exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, dirtied cum grano, which it will have ended up being it</seg>
		<seg id="49">Indeed under a form less stiff, more burst and subtler.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But we do not deceive, tout aussi constraining.</seg>
		<seg id="51">Because well more that the taxable face of the academic program, this thesis says the interior necessity of a life.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Bernard Didier, assistant chief executive officer of Morpho, considers even that &quot;the century will be biometrical&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Only the biometry will allow checking on the identity of a person realizing transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The organizations dedicated to the protection of the private life confirm this infatuation for the biometry, but they worry about it.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Nothing that in 2011 and in France, the national Commission of the computing and of the freedoms has authorized 774 systems of gratitude of the imprints, of the form of the hand or of the venous network of the hand in firms of the administrations, of the canteens...</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Everybody soon will be able to be identified, anyplace and anytime,&quot; moves itself Justin Brookman, person in charge of the life deprived of the consumers within the CDT (Center heart Democracy and Technology), in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The reasons of one such optimism, by ones, and pessimism, among the others?</seg>
		<seg id="9">The biometry is going to be based itself on new techniques, which will allow giving back the citizens and the consumers new services.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Today, in France, the most used biometrical data are the fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the venous network of loses it or of the fingers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But each of these techniques possesses his pressures.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;For example, some people who work the concrete have the very damaged fingers and their imprints are unreadable&quot;, notices Philippe Robin, technical manager of the identitaire domain by Thales Communications &amp; Security.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And the collection as the verification of the venous network and of the outline of the hand require a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is not at the same time a safety - one can not win these data at their insu - and a drawback: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and takes therefore time.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Consequence, investigations are led from twenty years on other approaches, as the gratitude of the face or of the iris (the part colored of the eye).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Thanks to the increase of the precision of the sensors and of the capacity of calculation of the computers necessary for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The precision of the facial gratitude has been multiplied by ten in the course of the five last years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, manager of the laboratories of R&amp;D d'Accenture in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With our help, the United Kingdom and the Holland have deployed of the automatic posts-borders using the facial gratitude.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Identifying a face or an iris on the move is henceforth possible.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;Today, we take investigations on the gratitude of the voice or in the way of walking with the aid of sensors sounds, but a silent environment is needed&quot;, indicates Sridhar Iyengar, manager of the research on the safety in the Intel Labs.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Unique and infalsifiable marker, the ADN arouses also hopes and anxieties.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;In the present state of the knowledge it can be considered as the ultimate biometrical datum&quot;, confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, manager of the studies, of the innovation and of the futurology at the CNIL.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the analysis of the ADN is still very long and very expensive.</seg>
		<seg id="24">NEC proposes to the police departments judicial a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze samples of ADN on the place of a crime and in an hour.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The uses of the biometry are divided up in two groups: the identification (to recognize a person among others) and the authentification (to check that the person is the one that she claims to be).</seg>
		<seg id="26">The identification concerned until now the release of papers of identity: the put biometrical elements (imprints, photo, iris) with the information that the State already possesses on all the citizens must be confronted.</seg>
		<seg id="27">That allows checking that a person does not try to usurp the identity of somebody else.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This principle of comparison can have other applications.</seg>
		<seg id="29">NEC proposes thus the gratitude of VIP at the entry of a hotel or of a store.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;We recover the pictures of the cameras of surveillance and compare them with the photos of the celebrities that circulate freely on Internet&quot;, explains Dany Nassif, responsible, by NEC France, of the commercial development for the solutions of biometrical identification.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Other use: taking a picture of a fellow who queues in a store, following his progress thanks to the facial gratitude and calculating the time of waiting.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The authentification concerned to the departure the physical accesses (borders protected places, canteens...) or logics (opening of a computer).</seg>
		<seg id="33">Has added to it, more lately, the control of presence.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;A biometrical checker avoids the phenomenon of the friend who clocks in for another&quot;, justifies Cyrille Bataller, d'Accenture.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But more and more, the authentification is going to concern also the transactions, in particular those realized from devices connected to Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In Japan, depriving some distributors of money introducing his card and putting his hand on a biometrical reader is already possible: this gesture replaces the touch of the secret code.</seg>
		<seg id="37">A similar technique is tested at Villeneuve-d'Ascq and at Angoulême by the society Natural Security in partnership with banks and signs of the great distribution: at the moment of paying in store with his bank card, the customer does not type his code, but he introduces his finger into a reader that scans the veins.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The experimentation is foreseen to last six months.</seg>
		<seg id="39">If it is conclusive, the biometrical readers could soon happen by the French storekeepers.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Of the tracks to reassure the users</seg>
		<seg id="41">There are three manners of making the biometry seductive at the eyes of the general public.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The first is of explaining that it can make to win time</seg>
		<seg id="43">&quot;If, thanks to the biometry, a customer remains thirty seconds less in crate desk, it is appreciable&quot;, explains the manager of a hypermarket.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The second is of offering personalized services: in some years, a vocal waiter will be able to recognize your voice and propose you options sur mesure.</seg>
		<seg id="45">And, finally, reassuring putting forward the precautions taken to protect the data bases.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;The fingerprints are stocked on a first waiter the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encoded and is stocked in a highly secured case, which is blocked if one tries to move it enumerates Philippe Robin, of Thales.</seg>
		<seg id="47">But, for want of deepened studies, knowing if these speeches convince really the users is impossible.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The specialists in the protection of the private life, them, continue worry.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;The progress of the facial gratitude, the multiplication of the cameras of surveillance and the enormous quantity of available photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, makes me fear the worst: a generalized surveillance&quot;, foretold Andrew Patrick, of the Police Station to the protection of the life deprived in Canada.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to make to pay up to 100 $ to the passengers who transport handluggages on his flights</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to start making to pay up to 100 $ for a handluggage and 2 $ for a coffee or a soda, although in his announcement Wednesday, it indicated that the passengers could take the can not opened with them to the descent of the airplane.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new expenses of handluggages concern the bags ordered in the superior compartment, therefore the small bags installed under the seat will be always free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier has declared that it would make 25 $ pay if the expenses were paid in advance and 100 $ if the travellers paid only a time to the door of boarding.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The spokesperson of Frontier, Kate O'Malley has indicated that the 100 $ were foreseen to incite the travellers to pay the expenses in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">«We do not want to make this price pay», it has explained.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The airlines have started making to pay the first and second luggages recorded in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The passengers who tried to avoid these expenses put as many things that they could in the orderly handluggages in the superior compartments, thus there was not often anymore place in these compartments.</seg>
		<seg id="9">These expenses are a means of checking that the passengers transport less things aboard.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'Malley has declared that these new expenses will really not be used to collect money</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is a matter of making to understand to the customers of Frontier most faithful that it becomes more and more difficult to take on place in the superior compartments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The passengers who buy their ticket on the site of the airline will not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus, a passenger queuing at a door of boarding Frontier could transport a bag for free, while the next person in the tail could have to pay 100 $ for a similar bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'Malley has explained that the site and the procedures of recording of Frontier are changing to guarantee that the passengers know the existence of these expenses before arriving to the door.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The expenses of handluggages of Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The passengers grumble often about the expenses of luggages and other expenses, but the airlines adore them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They consider that the costs of handling of the luggages are important and that the passengers who want this service should pay it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Good a number of people in Wall Street consider the addition of expenses of luggages as a sign that proves that the airlines make enough pay expensive to cover the cost with the journey aerial after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Nevertheless a good number of them have not affected the expenses of luggages.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first expenses of handluggages three years ago, and the company low-cost Allegiant has followed a bit later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other company imposing such expenses is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, has declared the consultant next to airlines Jay Sorensen, who follows close up the expenses in supplement.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He has considered, in a relation of December 2011, that the expenses of handluggages of Spirit brought in 50 M$ per annum.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a previous frame of Midwest Airlines, lately has traveled on Spirit and has wondered what it was going to take on to the door of boarding at the moment where the passengers would discover the expenses of unusual handluggages imposed by the company.</seg>
		<seg id="24">«Never I had seen a procedure of so fluid boarding of all my career», it declared.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see gratings of teeth and a fight burst at the door.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The airplane was full, it has added, «the passengers have gone up aboard to the speed lightning».</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier made also as Spirit and wall lamp of the expenses of 2 $ for a coffee a tea, a soda or a juice of fruit.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier has indicated that the passengers who take a soda or a juice of fruit can take the can not opened with them, and those that take coffee can resservis for free.</seg>
		<seg id="29">She will distribute always water for free.</seg>
		<seg id="30">WAYS Airways briefly has tried to make to pay for the drinks in 2008 but has come back backward seven months later after the passengers have complained and even though no other great airline had followed.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The decision of Frontier of making expenses of handluggages pay while the passengers do not buy directly their ticket next to the airline constitutes his last effort to incite the customers to go on his site.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airlines pay to the online salesmen of journeys as Orbitz 10 $ at 25 $ for every sold ticket</seg>
		<seg id="33">That has incited all the airlines to encourage an agency of online journey to the passengers to buy directly next to them instead of appealing.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Though, Frontier has gone further in this domain.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, it has started offering only half of miles of faithfulness to the customers who bought their ticket via an agency of online journey.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Wednesday, it has reduced the bonuses of miles of 25 % on a journey.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Thus, a journey Frontier de1 000 miles bought next to an agency of online journey would allow of earning 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">It allows also the passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly their ticket on the site of Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier has some faithful customers in his city of origin, Denver, but his activity moves back and it loses money</seg>
		<seg id="40">The receipts have fallen of 9 % and his capacity of flight has dropped nearly by 13 % in the course of the first term, according to the financial results published Wednesday by his mother society Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic has tried to right the finances of Frontier selling the airline.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists have just highlighted the way in which the movements of the tail of a dog are related to his mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Previous studies had revealed that the happy dogs moved their tail to the right (of the viewpoint of the dog) more, while the nervous dogs moved it more to the left.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But henceforth the scientists say that the dogs can detect these subtle differences and reply to it.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Teacher Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientifique of the university of Thirty, has declared: «Everybody knows that, at the man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimuli that awaken positive emotions or negatives. »</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here, we have tried to see what it was at other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It has added that as at the man, among the dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To know more on the way whose dogs react to the disordered movements of tail of other dogs, the researchers have followed animals at looking at films where depicted other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They have measured the cardiac frequency of the animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It will not be needed surely long before we understand why their tail goes sometimes of a side and sometimes of the other one.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Teacher Vallortigara has explained: «We have presented to dogs films where depicted other dogs – or a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid every other factor of confusion – and we have been able to trade the movement of the tail and to present it as going more on the left or on the right. »</seg>
		<seg id="10">While the animals have seen a dog without expression move the tail to the right (of the viewpoint of the dog that moves the tail), they have remained perfectly relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But while they have spotted a tail to deviate principally to the left (still a time of the viewpoint of the dog that moves the tail), their cardiac frequency has quickened and they seemed anxious.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Teacher Vallortigara has said that he did not think that the dogs communicated deliberately among them thanks to these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He thinks rather than the dogs know by experience the movements of which they would owe or should not worry.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It has added: «If you meet other dogs on several occasions and if you notice that, most of the time the movement of their tail to a side is associated with a friendlier attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience. »</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers indicate that the results could allow the owners, the veterinarians and the tamers to understand better the emotions of their animals.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The expert in canine behavior John Bradshaw, teacher invited the School of the veterinary sciences of the university of Bristol, has clarified that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and of the right by the canine species.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a team of the university of Lincoln has discovered that the dogs turned the head to the left while they concerned a dog aggressive and to the right while it was a matter of a cheerful dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another scientific study realized by the university of Victoria in Canada, it has declared: «The dogs went more easily to a robot dog while his tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of anxious evolution – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study. »</seg>
		<seg id="19">It has indicated that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs having participated in the different studies did entirely not consider the animals of the films or the robot dogs as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study on the way whose dogs react opposite true dogs could be useful, it has explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">«Although numerous elements, raised among different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used at different ends, a good number of details still must be clarified – and the dogs do not make exception», it has declared.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Though, being given the easiness with which their behaviors can be recorded it will not be needed surely long before we understand why their tail moves sometimes of a side and sometimes of the other one.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Congolese army (FARDC) has announced Thursday that his unity was going to pursue the rebels of the M23 up to in their bases situated in the forests and the mountains of the bordering Nord-Kivu of Rwanda and of Uganda.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The M23 appears on the point of being beaten after having been hunted of the localities of the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) that he controlled from the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;We are going to pursue the M23 and drive back it partout où he hides because it is a matter of criminals&quot;, has declared to Reuters the colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson of the FARDC.</seg>
		<seg id="4">We must not let them be reorganized because they martyr the Congolese people for too long.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The time is come of bringing back the peace.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Persons in charge of the M23 have explained to have evacuated the localities under the diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political person in charge of the rebellion, has maintained on RFI that these military backs would not modify his claims to the talks of peace in anything.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators, have recovered Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.</seg>

		<seg id="6">It has declared: «In some cases, it has gone too much far from inappropriate way. »</seg>
		<seg id="7">And the President is resolved to try to clarify oneself and to clarify clearly to the people that it conducted now a thorough re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels deceived.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I assure you that the innocent people will not be victims of abuse within the framework of this process.</seg>

		<seg id="12">And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Well and truly we have prevented airplanes from falling, of the buildings of exploding and people of being murdered because we have been able to read about the facts in advance.</seg>

		<seg id="15">The senator Chris Murphy du Connecticut has indicated that he had expressed itself in front of the members of the European Parliament and of others this week and that it was worried at the threats that they had uttered regarding a possible withdrawal of the anti-terrorist organizations because of the feeling of frustration that the surveillance of the National Security Agency arouses.</seg>

		<seg id="18">The press reports that the NSA has won millions of communications in Europe, what has put to harm the relationships with some allies of the United States, however the manager of the agency has declared this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a matter of a misunderstanding because that concerned metadatas that the allies of the NATO had collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Other revelations have stated documents divulged by Snowden according to which the NSA had intercepted data and communications emanating of the portable telephone of the German chancellor's wife Angela Merkel and of those of 34 other heads of state.</seg>

		<seg id="25">It has explained that the European heads of state had to be honest with their citizens about the type of programs of espionage that they apply themselves for years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">«We can modify our programs of surveillance in order to better protect the rights from the Europeans, but also they must understand that we are not the only ones in the world to make espionage», has declared Murphy.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After having thrown the sponge with crash in January for the partial resumption of the site Goodyear of Amiens-North promised to the closing, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of the American pneumaticien Titan, declares itself today, ready to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 that counts the factory.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Arnaud Montebourg, minister of the productive recovery, had already announced it Monday, October 21st.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After having renounced the project of purchase of the factory in January, you come back today.</seg>
		<seg id="4">You had uttered violent attacks and insults, talking about &quot;so-called workers&quot;, that &quot;work three hours&quot; by day, of unions &quot;madmen&quot;, aiming at the CGT.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One does not understand this volte-face.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It is to please in M. Montebourg?</seg>
		<seg id="7">I do not try of pleasing to nobody.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Reserving the right my woman.</seg>
		<seg id="9">M. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to rescue manufacturers from the jobs among the better paid ones.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If I have hurt somebody by my words, I am distressed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But France has a high level of tax and of unemployment also.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Does the truth hurt you?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Working seven hours a day when in other countries one works eight hours handicaps France.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In India, in China and in lots of other countries, one works ten to twelve hours a day.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But I do not have prejudices on France.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What I see, it is a factory that produces good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well situated and has spaces to expand.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Why does Titan need this factory so much?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Titan does not need to buy this factory.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But, with a correct price and competent workers, that it is the blow worth to try.</seg>
		<seg id="20">What type do you wait for agreed between the CGT and Goodyear?</seg>
		<seg id="21">If, from the announcement of the closing of the factory, Goodyear had offered the wage earners a good compensation of departure, I think that 100% of the employees would have accepted it</seg>
		<seg id="22">Now, imagine that Titan buys the closed factory to Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Ever since, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to every other country of the European Union that has still his own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I think that Mr. Montebourg knows that.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Yet, he wants to keep the factory of Amiens with at least 333 well paid jobs</seg>
		<seg id="26">Titan accepts to recruit them among the about 1 200 present wage earners of Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Also Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment of Titan before trying to lead the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The first stage is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on the compensations of departure for all the employees.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Ever since, employees will not be anymore in the factory.</seg>
		<seg id="30">M. Montebourg has said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Do you confirm it</seg>
		<seg id="32">The only one numbers that I have mentioned to the minister, it is 333.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I know that he would want a guarantee of four years.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But as I have told it to you, the CGT and Goodyear must start first agreed on compensations of departure.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If all the wage earners accept them, the project of purchase of the factory starts up with zero employee.</seg>
		<seg id="36">How can we give guarantees of duration of job when it does not remain employees anymore on the site?</seg>
		<seg id="37">If Mr. Montebourg gets to what the CGT and Goodyear start agreed and that Titan buys the factory, we have well the intention of remaining years in Amiens-Nord more than four.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A new request of collective resort has been put down against the brothers Sainte-Croix, regarding of the agressions sexual that would have taken place this time to the oratory Saint-Joseph as in several orphanages, schools and schools.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The petition bases on the testimony of the applicant, identified as &quot;J.

		<seg id="3">The first resort aimed only at three establishments, and when one has announced the regulations, many people have told to us: &quot;me, I was to such a place, I can register myself&quot;?, tells the lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two resorts.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The collective resort that has just been put down has as particularity to allow the addition of plaintiffs of any establishment where of the abuses have can to be perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The revelations of the NSA increase the paranoia of the firms with regard to the surveillance of State</seg>
		<seg id="1">By a beautiful day of thin August, a helicopter of the German police has flown at low altitude over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On order of the federal Office of protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national agency of information German, his mission was of photographing the roof of the American outpost, situated except 5 km of the European Central Bank and of the Bundesbank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The German media explain that the BfV expected from listening to identify the presence of antennae and that the operation has aroused an exchange between the United States and the German ministry of the foreign Businesses in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Clapper, the manager of the American services of information, has stressed again in September the fact that the United States do not use their capacities as regards foreign information «to steal the industrial secrets of the foreign firms for the account of American societies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits».</seg>
		<seg id="5">But for that Edward Snowden, the consultant become denouncer, has started unveiling his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of the surveillance of the United States, the European governments and the leaders of firms do not know more if the manager must be believed on word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Of the relations according to which the American National Security Agency has spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by American purveyors of services of stocking in the Cloud, notably Google and Yahoo, more than never have aroused the paranoia of the firms with regard to the surveillance of State.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The revelation according to which the telephone of the German chancellor's wife Angela Merkel had been pirated, maybe even for a decade, has been the drop that has made the vase overflow.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the most powerful person of Europe can be aimed at, then the leaders of firm are surely also potential targets.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between the American services of information and the firms</seg>
		<seg id="10">I consider that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.</seg>
		<seg id="11">«Germany must wake up», declares Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents the German SME of the sector of the TI.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The German societies think that the United States represent a risk as important as China while it is a matter of industrial espionage and of flight of data, according to an inquiry published in July by the office of advice EY.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates at this day that the United States have transmitted industrial secrets from foreign firms to American societies</seg>
		<seg id="14">The politicians have made part of their anxiety to the idea that the EU does not have computer capacities and Internet sufficient and think that she should endeavor to reduce his dependence in relation to the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The leaders of firm are sceptical on that subject.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A deputy of the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I can only close the eyes and reopen them slowly...</seg>
		<seg id="18">«It is not the good way of making», indicates Hasso Plattner, president of the society of software of German firm SAP.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If one wanted a strong European industry of the TI, then it must not be let die 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Everything is subsidized in Germany, from the coal at the cars, going by by the farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">All except the industry of the TI.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nevertheless, the extent and the sophistication of the American agencies of espionage displayed by the revelations of Snowden have been a shock for some firms that thought until then that China represented the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A big change is happening in the computing in cloud since the European persons in charge have realized the fact that the data preserved in the United States are governed in accordance with the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to an inquiry realized by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organism, about 10 % of the not American members have renounced their projects of using an American purveyor of services of stocking in the cloud after the revelations on the American program of exploration of the data Prism.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Jim Snabe, co-manager of SAP, declares: «Our customers put to us today a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where are my data preserved and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction? ».</seg>
		<seg id="26">Numerous German leaders indicate that the last relations are only a confirmation of what they knew already, that is to say that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data consequently must be kept to everything price</seg>

		<seg id="0">The parents of intersexed children can choose «indeterminate sex»</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for the infants born with ambiguous sex organs.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The male or feminine sex of the new ones born will not be attributed to them anymore, in a rigid way, at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Within the framework of the new law, the parents no more will be obliged to declare the sex of their child, allowing to them to note down an «indeterminate» sex or«not specified» on his birth certificate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The goal of the law was of taking off the pressure that weighed on the shoulders of the parents that could make decisions thrown regarding a surgery of sexual reallocation for their infant, and to fight against the discrimination contrary to the intersexed people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the BBC, an intersexed person would have said years later, «I am not either a man or a woman. »</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, contused and gashed.</seg>
		<seg id="7">One values that a child on 2 000 born every year, is not either a boy or a girl</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are intersexed, the intersexuality being part of the group of the sixty illnesses diagnosed as disorders of the sexual development, a generic term referring to the people possessing chromosomes or atypical gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sex organs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson would have been able to be intersexed.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The sexual identification is well not always included but most of the specialists in the United States say about the child that while the sex can not be determined, it is worth to use better the best information available for attributing it to wait then and to follow the psychological and physical development before envisaging a surgical act, in this case.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Dr Jack Drescher, psychiatrist to New York and specialist in the questions of sexual identification, has declared that the new German law «seems to be a good idea».</seg>
		<seg id="12">The intersexed children put an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">«Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require a surgical act, but it is not the case of most of the children», it has added.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is possible to make an assignation sexual without operation, and to see how the identity develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science that consists that is to say how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nobody can reply to the question of knowing why that happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is as the mystery that people surround the homosexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A relation subjected to the European Commission in 2011 described the intersexed people as transsexuals, different from the people, or transkinds, since their statute is not related to the sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not either exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is in general the two at the same time and not clearly definite as being one or the other one.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics can appear of themselves in the secondary sexual characters, (as the muscular mass, the pilosity, the chest and the stature), the primary sexual characters (as the reproductive organs and the sex organs) or the structure of the chromosomes and the hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The relation gave also a survey of the discrimination to which were confronted the intersexed people and transkinds as regards job as the extent of the acts of harassment and of violence and of the crimes motivated by prejudices.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The young boys of non-consistent kind have henceforth camps that are especially intended to them.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal allow already the adults to note down male, feminine sex or «third sex» on their official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, an Australian of 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, has become the first person to the world to have been pleaded «neutral» after to have won his trial in call that allows him to keep a sex« not specified» for life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The German passports will comprise a third designation beside M or F – X for intersexed, according to the ministry of the Inside.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, the questions of kind are always the subject to controversies, according to a report broadcast on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozen legislators of this foncièrement Catholic country have signed a petition so that the «theory of the kinds» is withdrawn from the textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The American site Catholic Online is itself also opposite to the German law, writing only «since the world is dragged in a new reign where the kind is a choice but where the sexual activity is not one, one knocks over two other pillars of the civilization. »</seg>
		<seg id="28">In Maryland, the mother of an infant also has declared on Baby Zone that it préfèrerait that a sex is attributed to the babies to their birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">«The role of parent is sufficiently stressing out without additional restrictions, in particular if you do not know the sex of your child», it has declared on the site intended to the related youths.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The children need stability and certainties.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, the children born without male or feminine sex organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And hardly ten years ago, the medical community considered the kind as a slate, which one can erase and on which one can redraw.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But henceforth, numerous are those that question the ethical foundation of the surgery, knowing that the sexual identity is complex and that sometimes the doctors can make a mistake, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reallocation while it will grow.</seg>
		<seg id="34">«In the middle of 20th century, one called that a psychiatric urgency», has indicated Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">While these children were born, one did not call the psychiatrist, one phoned the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The dominant theory on the way of treating the provided children as ambiguous sex organs has been launched by Dr John Money, of the university Johns-Hopkins, which considered that the kind is malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It has hallowed the term «sexual identity» and maintained that the social and environmental signals – the way whose parents bring up a child – interact with the genes and the hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as being of sex male or feminine.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in a case of 1966, known under the name of «John/Joan», his theories have given rise.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He had recommended the parents of a small boy whose penis had been cut during a botched circumcision to make it castrate entirely, taking him also the testicles, and to raise it as a girl</seg>
		<seg id="40">«Money has presented that as a successful case of transition, but it was not the case», has declared Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">To the age of about 15 years, he has become a boy and has married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But at 38 years, he has committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher has declared that some doctors «always repeat this model».</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the years 1990, with the arrival of Internet, those that have survived these operations of change in sex say«[qu']ils are not satisfied with the result».</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such a is the case of Jim Bruce, a writer of 36 years of Montana, that has arisen with male chromosomes XY but ambiguous sex organs.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The doctors could really not say if it had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced of his being able never to have a «satisfactory life» as man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Therefore little time after his birth in 1976, Bruce has undergone a surgical ablation of the external organ and of the testicles and has been raised as a girl</seg>
		<seg id="48">One has made to him to take feminine hormones to the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">«I knew that I was not a girl it has declared on ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was not happy, but asking questions was really difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At 18 years, it has undergone a vaginoplastie.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But depressed and realizing that something did not go, he has asked for his medical file.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he has discovered has horrified it</seg>
		<seg id="54">I have not been sterilized at birth – and nobody had ever told it to me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce has been born with a disorder of the sexual development (DDS) that has prevented his body from producing sufficiently of testosterone so that his sex organs can develop.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After having learned the truth, he has become a man, following a treatment to the testosterone and has made to take off the breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The surgery has made it sterile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, it defends the cause of the others in an organization called Interface Project, who tries to normalize the perception of the intersexed people.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general manager of the organization to not lucrative goal based in Californie Advocates heart Informed Choice, feared that the German law «induces to the labelling and to the stigmatization».</seg>
		<seg id="60">«Numerous activists worry that the German law encourages to the parents to make fast decisions and give to their child an &quot;indeterminate&quot; sex», it has declared.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that it encourages the interventions.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think that it would be worth to attribute better a male or feminine sex, and to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we have not seen what the law was going to give, therefore we can only bring forward hypotheses.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis has declared that his organization supported the Australian law because «it allows the adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex appellation».</seg>
		<seg id="65">«The adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind », it has added.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law concerns the attribution of the sex at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">It is not a battle that the young children should lead to that age.</seg>
		<seg id="68">While they will grow, they will be able to make decisions regarding their own body.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr Arlene Baratz, radiologist specialized in the mammographies to Pittsburgh, of which the girl is attack of a disorder of the sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a group of support, has declared that the German law «will give» responsibilities the parents and the children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">The girl of Dr Baratz, Katie, has been born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called syndrome of complete insensibility at the androgens.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because of the weakness of his receivers of androgens, Katie has developed feminine characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">It has a vagina, but not of uterus nor of ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Today aged of 29 years, Katie is married and interns in infantile psychiatry to the university of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Although it is sterile, she expects from adoption or from carrying mothers to have children by the intervention of services.</seg>
		<seg id="75">«The law leaves some latitude to the parents so that they do not have to set of precocious decisions», has declared Baratz.</seg>
		<seg id="76">That leaves the time of making some tests and of including them to them, and a deadline before noting down «male» or« féminin ».</seg>
		<seg id="77">Thus, everything is fine – you can bring up your child and love it</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a magnificent baby and take advantage of the pleasure of being related.</seg>
		<seg id="79">You do not have to throw oneself for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">«That puts the children to the heart of the decision and lessens the feeling of anxiety that motivates the parents because they are afraid of not making what is needed», it has declared.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Finally, the child will decide with what il/elle sex him feels le/la more comfortably – and it is something tremendous.</seg>
		<seg id="82">That allows the child to make the decision for itself</seg>

		<seg id="1">I have voted for two times for the president Obama, believing in the possibility of a change</seg>

		<seg id="3">The obstructionism does not forgive the difficulties of the site Obamacare, or the attacks of drones</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dissertation of the campaign 2008 of Obama is a sad recall of what would have been able to happen</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in 2nd year of medicine at the Faculty of medicine of Harvard.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I am reading a hideously sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a book that, I thought, would encourage to me during the gloom of the 2nd year of medicine and would return hope to me.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called «The Audacity to Win» and it is a matter of the dissertations of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I have finished the medical accounts-returns of my patients the night and that I go to bed, this book brings back me at that time where the policies inspired millions of people and where the speeches could cut you whispers it.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election has ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of the newspapers of news have taken the time of thinking about the historical nature of the moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My friends have cried for joy and my parents have preserved all the newspapers that they have taken on.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionaries advanced to the House-White and the nation was ready for the change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">For the period of transition of Obama before his capture of duty in 2008, it had 82 % of favorable opinions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The return to the present is a difficult waking, it is as going out from a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Remembering these days full of optimism is difficult, it is as distant memories, a sad recall of the opportunities of the past.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The change has really happened in the years that have followed the first time that I have voted.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That did not have anything to see with what I had imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I put to the credit of Obama of great works, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (law on the reasonable care) up to the departure of Iraq of our army, going by by the end of the «neither seen nor known» and the murder of Oussama ben Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Furthermore, I believe that the partisan obstructionism has destroyed de trop numerous efforts aiming at making our nation advance in the domain of the reforms of the immigration, of the public care of health and of the closing of Guantanamo, among other things.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after having many times defended the administration of Obama in view of my peers and my colleagues, I do not manage anymore to supply with explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I am political at the edge of the despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The republican obstruction can not explain the bet on listening of the foreign leaders, or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It can not explain that the National Security Agency gathers data on the private life of the Americans, nor the indictment of the denouncers who reveal the misdemeanors of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It can not justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial or the evasion of the public financings and the overtaking of the expenses authorized during the presidential campaigns</seg>
		<seg id="26">It can not justify the conclusions of a relation that says only the efforts of the House-White to reduce the media to the silence are the «more aggressive... from the administration of Nixon».</seg>
		<seg id="27">And, no more lately, she can not forgive the impossibility to conceive a simple Internet site for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know if it is it that I expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">So, at 18 years, I was supposed to understand that the gouvernance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it</seg>

		<seg id="36">Nevertheless, even though the clue of favorable opinions has plunged this week under the 45 % of them, bringing back to the year 2008 through this book is still more difficult.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The United States sometimes have gone &quot;too far&quot; as regards espionage, has recognized the secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in full debate with Europe on the massive collection of data by the national Agency of safety (NSA).</seg>
		<seg id="2">After ten days of scandal, of revelations and of denials between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American governmental person in charge admits explicitly practices debated in the interception by the NSA of communications and of data in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;In some cases, I concede it to you, as the president has made it, some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to check that that does not happen anymore in future&quot;, has declared John Kerry during a conference in London that he participated in from Washington Thursday, October 31st by link video.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In his intervention broadcast, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the leader of the American diplomacy in a long way has justified the practices of information and of collection of information by the necessary antiterrorist fight and the prevention against possible attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Invoking the attacks of September 11th, 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry has assured that the American authorities had for foiled of numerous projects of attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.</seg>

		<seg id="7">And, has asserted John Kerry to the address of the Europeans, &quot;I insure you that in this process of the innocent people&quot; have not been &quot;deceived&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="9">&quot;And yes, in some cases, it has gone too much far from inappropriate way&quot;, still has admitted the secretary of State, which had already had to express itself on this international scandal during a last round the week to Paris, London and Rome.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It has assured Thursday night that preside over it Obama was &quot;resolved to try to clarify oneself and that it conducted a re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels deceived&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued swell this week with new revelations in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data of hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained next to the ex-consultant from the NSA Edward Snowden, maintains that programs it called &quot;MUSCULAR&quot;, and led with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows to these two agencies recovering data from the optic fibres used by the giants of internet.</seg>

		<seg id="15">These interceptions would take place outside the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Yahoo and Google have denied every connection to these practices.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Since ten days, several great newspapers in France, in Germany, in Spain or in Italy, have revealed that the NSA would have intercepted data massively and communications emanating of allies of the United States and of their leaders, notably the German chancellor's wife Angela Merkel.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Studies show that the young afro-américaines and Hispanic girls have tendency to reach the age of the puberty earlier than the young white girls</seg>
		<seg id="2">The physical changes do not mean that the puberty is imminent</seg>
		<seg id="3">Nothing proves only the hormones or that of other chemical substances is responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">The experts think that the epidemic of obesity could be a release mechanism of the precocious puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The tendency around a precocious puberty is so not pronounced by the boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The previous correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialized journalist in the family questions and of health by the child.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Must a mother worry if the breasts and the pubic hairs of his girl start leading into 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">During the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics that has been held this week to Orlando, in Florida, Dr Paul Kaplowitz, pédo-endocrinologue, has explained that these precocious physical changes are ordinary enough among the young Americans and represent a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">«I spend a lot of time to reassure the parents – in general, that does not indicate a fast evolution around the full puberty», has declared Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The evident signs of development, such as the budding of the breasts, the hairs under the arms and in the pubic zone and the corporal smells, appear earlier at the girls</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there has been only a light overhang of the age of the first rules in the course of the four last decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age is of 12 years and a half, even though it was of 12 years three quarters in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">«Once the chest has started developing, at least two or three years are needed before the first rules appear», has indicated Kaplowitz, also the author »of« Early Puberty in Chorus Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem».</seg>
		<seg id="14">The time is the most precise test to know how the puberty is going to evolve.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is a debate regarding what constitutes the real appearance of the puberty, but it is considered as «precocious» while the development of the chest is accompanied with a sudden growth before the age of 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most of the cases, the development slows down or it stops is something that a pediatrician can follow close up.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A faster evolution can justify tests realized by an endocrinologist to remove serious problems as tumors or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to warn about other consequences: a premature ageing of the bones that can slow down the growth and a small size to the adulthood.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations as regards medicinal and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is careful with the medicines but he admits that «the fact of controlling the puberty can lessen some problems of behavior and the sensation for the young girls of being different from the others».</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other great problem is comprehensible: The parents do not want quite simply not that their very young girls have their rules.</seg>
		<seg id="23">«They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they are going to manage the questions of hygiene», has declared Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">«That has been a shock», that a woman whose girl has had his first rules at 10 years remembers</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even if there were signs and that we had talked about the rules, it was not prepared emotionally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It has fit from the school frightened and distressed by being the first among his friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are numerous theories taken to the knowledge of the public on the causes of the precocious puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Nevertheless, there is not any coherent theory according to which the hormones contained in the milk or of other foods, the present chemicals in the environment or the sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The boys, as the girls reach their puberty earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz maintains that the most credible hypothesis is that of the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He has participated in a study taken on aged girls of 6 to 9 years that binds the percentage of fatty mass to the release of the puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are numerous other influential factors</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, the young afro-américaines and Hispanic girls have tendency to reach the age of the puberty earlier than the young white girls</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are diverse explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">To the world ladder the mechanisms of the precocious puberty seem to be influenced by everything, of the economic conditions to the climate, going by by the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Other problem: Although the boys have hairs on the face and in the pubic zone younger, the tendency to a real precocious puberty is also not pronounced than by the girls</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors participating in the conference of the AAP have stressed the complexity of the subject.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of the acne and of the pubic hairs is ordinary, even by the infants and the babies.</seg>
		<seg id="39">«We must be careful as for the way in which we identify the real appearance of the puberty», has said Dr Lawrence Silverman, a pédo-endocrinologue working to the hospital for children Goryeb to Morristown, in New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice to know how to speak with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">«That can mean to have a conversation more early than foreseen», has explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you remain quiet, your child will react well in general.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The girls whose puberty is precocious must be reassured on the fact that, even while that happens earlier than predicted, the process is part of the life.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Reprocessed for 2008, he has participated in 2004 in the creation of the association of defense of the hostages &quot;Hostages of the world&quot;, that it presides for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">His main objective: obtaining the possibility for the hostages of lodging a complaint and of taking their hostage takers in front of the international criminal Court</seg>

		<seg id="5">After checkups to the military hospital of the Val-de-Grâce Wednesday afternoon, they have been able, for to find their families.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And trying, gradually, to recover the lesson of their life.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;The New Observer&quot; has questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years, ex great tall reporter, reprocessed for 2008, president of the association &quot;Hostages of the world&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">From the night of your release, you were on the tray of the 20 hr of &quot;Antenna 2&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">What are today your memories of your release?</seg>
		<seg id="10">On site notably, in Beirut.</seg>
		<seg id="11">When I am freed, I find myself in the chest of a car that I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Roger Auque.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It calls me &quot;one is freed&quot;, but I am not sure, and tell to myself that one can still be killed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">One is very excited, but very tightened also.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is the war, and those that drive us are them as very tight</seg>
		<seg id="15">They depose us on the edge of a sidewalk.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are Syrian servicemen.</seg>
		<seg id="17">One arrives afterwards on the site of the hotel Summerland where the press is present.</seg>
		<seg id="18">French lead us the embassy of France.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It is the time of the first phone calls to the parents to the family, to the friends, at the press...</seg>
		<seg id="20">I remember to have taken a bath for an hour.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And having dined in t-shirt at the embassy of France.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I remember also a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The tension is always there because we do not have means to evacuate us to the airport of Larnaca in Cyprus.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Happened over there in helicopter, one takes a private airplane that brings us back in France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How has your arrival taken place on the French ground?</seg>
		<seg id="26">One lands at Orly.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is a bit brutal.</seg>
		<seg id="29">There is an incredible hustle.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And many media.</seg>
		<seg id="31">When I have left there were three television channels.</seg>
		<seg id="32">I come back and there is some full.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The descent of the stairs of the airplane, the reunions with my son and my parents my friends, all that is extremely loudly in emotion.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Between the airport and at my place, numerous motorbikes follow our car that Roussin drives.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The motorcyclists clear off the stuffing to make photos and follow me up to by me where I must make a little the police to prevent some from going up.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The media pressure is enormous.</seg>
		<seg id="37">That does not stop, we are well placed to know it...</seg>
		<seg id="38">But the state of emotion and of tiredness is such than seeing light is difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="39">One goes out of a hole and one is suddenly under the media fires</seg>
		<seg id="40">It is a bit complicated, a bit violent, complex enough to manage.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But one has made the hardest.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The soir-même, I belong to the 20 hr, the day after as I am to the telly.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Begin afterwards a kind of readjustment to the life, very sweetly, for one or two months that are a bit as vacations.</seg>
		<seg id="44">How have the checkups and the debriefing DGSE happened?</seg>
		<seg id="45">I had had medical control right at one first in Corsica</seg>
		<seg id="46">The rest has been made in the Val-de-Grâce the next days my return: radios, examinations in all kinds and meets with a psychiatrist.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It is not a session that makes everything but one knows that one can count on it to remind it if need, that one is not not delivered to ourselves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">That is part of the procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="49">I have also met the services of information.</seg>
		<seg id="50">They have asked me questions on the hostage takers.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It was logical.</seg>
		<seg id="52">That has not hampered me.</seg>
		<seg id="53">How do you react, today, to the release of the four hostages of Niger?</seg>
		<seg id="54">I listen to what is said.</seg>
		<seg id="55">The debate on the ransoms notably.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Some things irritate me, of other minuses.</seg>
		<seg id="57">I try to make the part of the things between the questions on my past as hostage and my cap of president of the association &quot;Hostages of the world&quot; that allows me to put distance, and seems me well more interesting to board.</seg>
		<seg id="58">I question myself about the definition of the ductility for example.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Especially, I fight, with others, for the gratitude of the legal statute of the hostage.</seg>
		<seg id="60">There is according to me a problem of semantics.</seg>
		<seg id="61">It is needed to describe the taking of hostages as taking of hostages &quot;policy - what is the case most of the time - and to allow the hostages to have access to the justice to lodge a complaint and to take their hostage takers in front of the international criminal Court</seg>
		<seg id="62">Today, everybody is once furthermore, in the compassion, in the emotion, and looks forward to the release of these hostages.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But that says that these hostages maybe could have them also access to the justice</seg>
		<seg id="64">A court in The Hague is made for that.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Why one would not tell to the hostage takers &quot;you have scorned the rules of the war, as those of all the conventions of Geneva, one is going to take you in justice</seg>
		<seg id="66">That seems me nevertheless founded, legitimate, struck of the common sense.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This message is heard, but not listened, and that shocks me.</seg>
		<seg id="68">It is my main fighting.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: The split of Europe gives the choice to the Scots</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another worrying history of independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, one warns us that an independent Scotland would be obliged to join the European zone of free circulation to be able to adhere to the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">And this is you are are that one hears histories of passport control to Berwick and of a border of barbed sons along the wall of Hadrien.</seg>
		<seg id="4">If it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde has indicated the possible economic fallouts of a greater freedom of circulation with the rest of Europe, that did nevertheless not appear in the headlines (and it was to be foreseen).</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nobody neither has not said that the Member States of the EU devote a great part of their time to bypassing their formal rules while that sorts them out.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Since Scotland is not part of the space Schengen for the time being, a continuous non-respect of the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in equivalent of all it which she wants to obtain from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is therefore a matter of a history that is not one.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And a so old history that it is now congealed: I have heard for the first time the fib according to which «the independence means the passport control» for more than 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nevertheless, one has forgotten a point interesting in this interpretation of an old dusty story.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, actually?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why to exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, in particular maintaining?</seg>
		<seg id="12">These are is you are the real topicality regarding Europe: the great plan of post-war period aiming at unifying Europe is definitively at the neutral.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the crisis of the euro, the Europe Project is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Across Europe, the parties that oppose the EU or that militate in favor of the abandonment of the euro as common currency, win from the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the euro-skeptic party Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and not arrived of anywhere, has gathered nearly five million voice during the federal elections of September and has taken out the democratic liberal Party (equivalent of our Liberals-democrats) of the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There has always been a national opposition to the project of creation of a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Though, the present economic crisis has marked a turn.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the constraint weighing on the domestic economics by the intermediary of the adhesion to the unique currency, has driven numerous people to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the euro does not have much to see with the national governments that record excessive budget deficits – that was uniquely true for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The European system has rather made to weigh on his members exchange rates favorable to the German exporters – it which the German politicians want to preserve.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of Europe of the south meet themselves with a problem of intrinsic productivity in relation to Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only resort is of making cups dark in the salaries and the public expenditures – encouraged by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Beyond the topical budget and monetary problems, there is a deeper uneasiness related to the productivity in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With reference to the «green» energetic policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize the French and German societies of the sector of the energy to the expenses of the consumer – the European industry pays two times more for the electricity and four times more for the gas than the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It is a matter of a damning drawback in terms of costs, as we have already seen it at Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All the frosts of salaries to the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry of being penalized by a gas of good American schist market.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result, the revolt rumbles, in particular in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite has considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and of putting Paris on a foot of equality with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin does not need Paris anymore as passport of his legitimity talks about politics and has imposed his own economic policy in Europe, letting the French economics put to harm struggle.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result: the party of extreme right of Navy The Pen, the anti-European National Forehead has just taken away a crucial by-election, dismissing the socialists in power to the third place</seg>
		<seg id="31">The National Forehead is henceforth the most popular party in France with 24 % of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labor Party that reminds him that he can not leave from the principle that a schism of the right will favor the left automatically.</seg>
		<seg id="32">That is Marine Le Pen with his new popularity next to the French white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the European elections of the next year to create a unique and anti-European anti-currency block within the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the anti-European parties make good face to these elections, what is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is you are are what I think: very soon, the anti-European feeling and unique anti-currency in Europe is going to be unified and will end up killing the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it will fall to «something that will look more like «the» free «Europe of the Nations (sovereigns)» favored by the General of Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and some of his satellite economics could preserve the euro, but France and the Europe of the south will find their own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect what the United Kingdom takes his distances in relation to this project, and I hope that it will make the eyes sweet in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Though, the interest growing of Washington for the Pacific lead to think that Great Britain will be left for account in the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">And Scotland, in all that?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can decide to be a region of the small England (mainly).</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests, what includes of sending Berlin and Brussels to pass.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I believe that Scotland could adapt to a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The cooperation with the other countries to the similar sights would be easier in a not federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and preserve our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The government SNP of Scotland is – and it is to be noticed – the political movement anti-austerity that has the one better succeeded in Europe, since it has taken away a spectacular majority in 2011 based on his opposition to the dark cups proposed (and implementations) by the Chancellor of the chessboard Labor Party member, Alistair Darling, and the coalition conservatives/Liberals-democrats that has followed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous now for the Scotland of voting for the independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in your car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Even though the planners of the road network of the United States have harm to find the money necessary to repair the freeway infrastructure in decrepitude, numerous those are that anticipate a solution in the form of a small black box that settles above the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices which record all the miles gone over by a motorist and pass on the information to the officials, are at the center of an attempt debated at Washington and in the governmental offices of the planning of revising the obsolete system of financing of the main American roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The sector generally without interest of the planning of the main highways suddenly has provoked a lively strong debate and of the eventful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The libertarians have joined ecological groups to make pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep the trace of the miles that you go over, and possibly of the road on which you circulate, to use then the information to write a fiscal bill.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Tea Party is appalled.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Liberties Union is it also very worried and expresses his anxiety regarding the protection of the private life.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And while the members of the Conference do not manage to start agreed to know if one must continue, several States have not waited.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They look how, in the course of the next decade, they will be able to pass to a system allowing the drivers to pay according to the number of miles gone over.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a system of surveillance by GPS, for an experimental drive.</seg>
		<seg id="10">That is really essential for our nation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">«It is not as if we had the choice», has declared Hasan Ikhrata, chief executive officer of the Southern California Association of Governments, which foresees that the State starts recording the miles gone over by every californien motorist of here 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There is going to be change in the way in which we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there to make it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, financed with the taxes that the Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Americans do not buy as much gasoline anymore as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The cars can go over more miles with a gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax itself which is of 18.4 a hundred by gallon, has not increased for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even d'1 a hundred, even though the prices of the gasoline are high.</seg>
		<seg id="19">«The tax on the gasoline is not quite simply not bearable», has declared Lee Munnich, a specialist in the policies of transports to the university of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His State has lately made to install tracers on 500 cars to test a system of payment at the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="21">«That it proves to be the most logical alternative in the long term», it has said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Wonks calls that of the expenses of use to the mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is not amazing that the idea seduces the urban Liberals, since the taxes could be used to modify the habits of behavior in order to allow reducing the congestions and the emissions of gas, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The planners of California are interested in the system since they elaborate strategies to reach the objectives set in the ambitious laws of the State on the climatic reheating.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But representing it Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), president of the Committee of the transports of the House of Representatives, has declared that he considered it also as the most viable alternative in the long term.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The partisans of the open market of the foundation Reason appreciate also the idea to make the drivers at the mile pay.</seg>
		<seg id="27">«It is simply not a matter of a tax sinking in in a great black hole», has declared Adrian Moore, vice-president of the policy at the foundation Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The people pay more directly for the advantages that are obtained for them.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement also is supported by two previous American secretaries to the Transports that, in a relation of 2011, exhorted the Conference to go to the way of the payment at the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The American Senate has approved of a pilot project of 90 M$ the last year that would have dealt with about 10 000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the presidency of the Bedroom has killed the suggestion, replying to the worries of the rural legislators representing voters who must go over numerous miles every day to surrender to their work or downtown.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Nevertheless Several States and great cities make progress of their side.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most determined is the Oregon, which has mobilized 5 000 drivers to take the most important experience from the country.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These motorists will pay soon kilometric expenses at the State instead of the taxes on the gasoline</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has eventually already led a pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The city of New York envisages one.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois tempts a testing on a number limited from trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the coalition I-95, who understands 17 agencies involved in the road transport in States bordering the coast is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, the Virginia and Florida) studies how she could make use of the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal success.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 voluntary motorists have lately equipped their car with a device the drivers were worried that the government can follow their lesser facts and gestures</seg>
		<seg id="41">«The anxieties about Big Brother and this kind of things are a big problem», has declared Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic management of the performance to the department of the Transports of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It is not something that the people want.</seg>
		<seg id="43">From the beginning of the testing, the ACLU of Nevada warned on his site: «Transforming these devices into mechanisms of location fully would be relatively easy. »</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is not necessary to build an enormous and troublesome technological infrastructure that unavoidably will be widened to preserve the recordings of the ones gone and come daily of the people.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is part of the few States that struggle henceforth to find a reasonable technology that would allow to the State knowing how many miles a car goes over, but without experiencing the exact place or hour.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If one can make that, has added Khan, the citizens will be more comfortably.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The research of this technology has taken some agencies of State to call on a small start-up of California of the name of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Originally, the society did not intend to help the motorists who pay taxes at the States.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She tried to pierce assurance in the emergent market car, in which the drivers would pay according to their mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices that she tests have pleased the planners of the main highways because they do not use the GPS and supply a limited quantity with information, loaded periodically by modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">«The people will be more prone to make that if you do not record their speed and do not localize them», has declared Ryan Morrison, chief executive officer of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Big mistakes have been committed in the pilot programs of some States.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are pretty less expensive means and pretty less intrusive methods of proceeding.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, the planners tempt the experience offering the motorists different choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Still they can choose not to have device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles gone over by everyone the residents of the State.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Other States hope to sell the concept to distrustful citizens allowing to the devices making some more, rather that not enough.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In the city of New York, the persons in charge of the transports try to develop a mechanism of taxation that also would be equipped to pay the expenses of parking, to supply an assurance «payment to the behavior» and to create a unity of data on the speed in time reality from the other drivers that the motorists could use to avoid the traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">«The motorists would be incited to participate because of the advantages that the system offers them», has indicated a document on the urban conversion.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Though, some planners of the transports wonder if the whole debate on the payment at the mile is simply not an enormous diversion.</seg>
		<seg id="61">In the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the zone of the bay of San Francisco, the persons in charge say about the Highway Trust Fund that the Conference could very simply manage the bankruptcy increasing the taxes on the gasoline</seg>
		<seg id="62">An additional unique or annual tax could be imposed on the drivers of hybrid vehicles and on of other of which the vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline so that each pays his fair part</seg>
		<seg id="63">«Resorting to a radical surgery while one quite simply needs aspirin is not necessary», he has declared Randy Rentschler, the manager of the legislation and of the public businesses next to the commission</seg>
		<seg id="64">If one makes that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about the protection of their private life and of a pile of other things.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Edward Snowden, the denouncer of the American information services, has declared that he was disposed to go to Berlin to testify German in front of the parliament if the National Security Agency des États-Unis and his manager Keith Alexander did not supply replies on their activities.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele has met Thursday Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he benefits from the right of asylum, to discuss of his testimony in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In a letter that the deputy has presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: «Although the result of my efforts has been of every positive obviousness, my government continues treat the difference of opinion as an escape and tries to penalize the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend oneself. »</seg>
		<seg id="4">To say, however, the truth is not a crime.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In his letter, Mr. Snowden has written that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the American government of abandoning the criminal loads kept against it</seg>
		<seg id="6">Within the framework of the complaint put down by the American ministry of the justice it is marked of espionage and of flight of goods of the State.</seg>

		<seg id="9">Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who leads the parliamentary group supervising the foreign secret services, has indicated that if there was a luck of hearing Mr. Snowden as witness «without taking it in danger and completely ruining the relationships with the United States», one must take advantage of it.</seg>
		<seg id="10">M. Ströbele, German Green deputy, has published a photo of it with Mr. Snowden on his account Twitter.</seg>
		<seg id="11">During his visit in Russia, it was accompanied of two German journalists.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new kind of dolphin with hump off the northern coasts of Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and the Study of the Animals and Sea Environments (OCEAMM) comes back for The Express Train on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Does the discovery of this new kind of dolphin at hump surprise you?</seg>
		<seg id="3">It is a good news, but that does not surprise me particularly.</seg>
		<seg id="4">If by the past, the species have been described and identified on morphological, anatomical and geographic base, today, the development of new tools such as the genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of the species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Moreover it is not impossible that this progress in genetics and in molecular biology questions the classification or the membership of a species to a kind, a family, indeed even an order.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At the beginning of the 19th century, the morphologistes have classified the animals, on base of the morphological differences between the species.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today, some of these classifications are questioned because of the progress of the genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the same way, two very close species morphologically have been distinguished thanks to the genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is the case of the new species that has just been identified.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the dolphins to hump of the Pacific and the humpback whales of the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The recent analyses have allowed distinguishing four species.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Why is it a matter of a discovery of importance as the Wildlife Conservation Society has asserted it?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Of a conservation viewpoint, it is essential to experience these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore his genetic variability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">If this population was already known for long by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only at this place.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Ever since, if a problem of caused massive mortality by a viral epidemic or of accidental capture lands in the region, we could have business to the extinction of a species, rather than to a local disappearance of a population of a species more largely spilled on Earth</seg>
		<seg id="16">This loss of genetic patrimony would be much more problematic.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A species is considered threatened or in the process of extinction according to the number of existent individuals on Earth in other words of the stock, and of the possibility that it has to restore itself neighbors from the stocks.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With regard to the species Underhas chinensis, which the population of the new discovered species is born of, his stock automatically has become weaker, making it thus more vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Why is discovering new kinds of sea mammals rare?</seg>
		<seg id="20">The sea mammals are situated at the top of the food chain.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They live in, open homogeneous habitats, in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between the populations and the individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Conversely, the more closed ecosystems favor the genetic isolation, which can eventually generate the creation of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is needed to know that the sea environment is the environment the less pretty well known.</seg>
		<seg id="25">One prefers to send robots on Mars, only of knowing surface of the sea what lives in the pit on the Mariannes, only at 11 kilometers.</seg>
		<seg id="26">One spends more money in the research of life on the other planets than in the sea research and it is high time that that changes.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The profit of Bomber on the decline, even though the deliveries and the commands of airplanes move back</seg>
		<seg id="1">Bomber Inc, Canadian aeronautical and railroad builder has signaled a fall of 15 % of his net profit Thursday, under the pressure of a fall of the commands and of the deliveries of airplanes in the course of the third term and of contractual problems in his division Trains</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bomber, based in Montreal, does not have either not supplied with data of testing in flight for his very new airplane CSeries or of allowing information of knowledge if the airplane will respect his ambitious calendar of setting up commercial before next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">About a month ago and half, the latter has stolen only three times, and the question then has landed of knowing if the stage of testing was in good way.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results have not been to the height of the forecasts and the lesson of the actions has moved back of 8 % to the Stock-Exchange of Toronto.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, analyst within the National Bank Financial, has lowered Thursday his notation, passing of «overperformance» to«performance of sector» because of the weak potential of rise of the grant in the course of the next term or of the two next terms.</seg>
		<seg id="6">«Although the fall of the deliveries of airplanes has been in great early part, really we are disappointed by the profitable margin in the Transport division », has declared Cameron Doerksen in a bill to the customers.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We think that Bombardier will record new commands for his airplanes CSeries as the program of testings in flight will advance.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Though, if any new command is not announced in the course of the next months, we expect what the market becomes more sceptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the family of airplanes CSeries will be able to catapult it in the inferior segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first airplane of testing has been unveiled in March and has flown away for the first time in September after months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the number of firm commands for the airplanes CSeries is modest until now to height of 177. It seems that the potential purchasers wait for the results of the testings in flight to validate the assertions of the society regarding the energetic effectiveness and the potential of economics of the new airliner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At the Present Time, the society has recorded a total of 403 commands and commitments of purchase next to 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Pierre Beaudoin, president and leader of the direction is convinced of Bombardier reaching his objective of 300 firm commands before the setting up commercial of the first airplane.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The leaders also have reassured the analysts and the media Thursday indicating to them that the program advanced in accordance with the calendar.</seg>
		<seg id="15">«The airplane of testing has not remained to the ground longer than foreseen,» has declared Mr. Beaudoin during a conference telephonic, adding that the testings to the ground and the software updatings were foreseen for the time of stopping of the airplane.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Every builder plans in a different way.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We had decided to conduct a first flight and to foresee a period of updating, and it is what we have made.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That will recur throughout the program of flight</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of the five airplanes of testing should fly away in the weeks to come, the others will follow little time after, has indicated the society</seg>
		<seg id="20">Nevertheless, the analysts are sceptical quant by the way that the first customer can make to steal an airplane CSeries only 12 months after his inaugural flight</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier has indicated that she was evaluating the calendar of entry in operation and will supply information with news in the course of the next months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">«This slowness of the testings in flight – although apparently it is model on the internal calendar of Bombardier – reinforces our opinion according to which the entry in operation will be rejected at the first term of 2015», has declared Mr. Doerksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">At the third closed term on September 30th, the net profit of Bombardier has fallen to 147 M$, or 8 a hundred by action in relation to 172 M$, or 9 a hundred by action a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The result by action adjusted has remained unchanged to 9 a hundred.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The incomes have lightly moved back of 4.2 to 4.1 Md$.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The analysts expected a result of 10 a hundred by action and of the incomes of 4.56 Md$, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth aeronautical builder to the world has indicated that it had delivered 45 airplanes in the course of the term, against 57 a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The net commands have fallen to 26 airplanes, against 83 beforehand.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The delay in the Aeronautical division represented 32.9 Md$ on September 30th, unchanged number in relation to December 31st of the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="30">«In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the weak number of commands and the general conditions of the market have been disappointing», has declared Mr. Beaudoin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The incomes of the Aeronautics have lowered of 13 % to affect 2 Md$.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bomber, the greatest railroad builder at the world, has declared to 2.1 Md$ that the incomes of this division had increased in nearly 11 %.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The notebook of commands of the Transport division totalized 32.6 Md$ on September 30th, or a slight rise in relation to December 31st of the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The margins of the Transport division have suffered from the problems of execution regarding some big contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The leaders have announced that new indications would be supplied in the course of the fourth term.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The lesson of the actions of Bombardier, which also has announced that Patrick Pichette, leader of the financial direction of Google Inc, siègerait to the board of directors, has fallen of 8.5 % to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Five years ago already that my father has erased itself of the world of the living beings.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Initially I have denied his death, I talked about it at the present,</seg>
		<seg id="2">I was so much afraid of forgetting it or rather I did not know how I was going to continue &quot;associate&quot; with it</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is not recipe, of fashion of job to pass the wall of the invisible one and to find hers</seg>
		<seg id="4">Then signs have appeared.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The first time it was the felt very strong one of his presence on the temporary seat even though I drove.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another time, a sweet waking in full night to look at his watch that does not leave me anymore, put on the nightstand.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is the picture of my cheerful father that accompanies me to my gestures to the daily.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Our mother has left us after his exhausting fighting against the cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is at least what I thought on the day where I found his empty body, shriveled on this bed of hospital to the crumpled sheets.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Similarly, his obsequies were an icy farewell focused around the thin light of the candles that framed his coffin.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I thought that it had left.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Gradually, by small diurnal or night appearances, a bit shy, a bit erased, in a fast way it has come back to my mind evolving as it recovered his place in the landscape of my thought that was believed in mourning.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And then, it revealed all unveiling myself my own facets that yet I had not perceived, concealed by my relationship with it</seg>
		<seg id="14">Therefore I have learned and understood that I in no way had lost the person of my mother but simply a woman that I did not know really, a woman who incarnated this person, for his stay in the life.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Dying, this woman had perfect his life and freed the person that I loved, and these are is you are that I found it, full and whole.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This bend of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is a privilege of knowing that the loved people never leave us.</seg>
		<seg id="18">I look like my father, &quot;inside as outside&quot; it adorned.</seg>
		<seg id="19">One has always told it to me.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I have never believed it at that time.</seg>
		<seg id="21">I have had difficult relationships with it until it becomes old, ill.</seg>
		<seg id="22">There, I have not been afraid of it anymore and I have been able to love it</seg>
		<seg id="23">A day, it is dead.</seg>
		<seg id="24">During long, he has accompanied me: when I have stopped smoking, when I have been afraid, when I have ached...</seg>
		<seg id="25">He talked to me, encouraged to me constantly, it dwelled on my body.</seg>
		<seg id="26">I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But it was never inquisitive.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I have been able to have a personal life.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It left me my intimacy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">That has lasted long then a day it has left.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Finally, it was comfortable and comforting to be included encouraged to, recommended</seg>
		<seg id="32">I do not know who said that the died people are not forgotten ones but invisible ones anymore.</seg>
		<seg id="33">My parents are not anymore but I feel them constantly close to me.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Every event, every instant of my life makes me to feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have made?</seg>
		<seg id="35">I dream constantly of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.</seg>
		<seg id="36">I dream often of the last instants that I must share with them before it is too much late, only, there is a thing always that prevents me of fulfilling this moment.</seg>
		<seg id="37">I wake up often distressed while that happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and are in line with my history and indeed, they continue live and share my life.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I have dreamed that I woke up, I heaved up out of the bed, my father waited for me on the landing and it smiled at me and was delighted that I wait for a small boy.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The day after, I had the feeling that he had visited to me in my sleep to mean me that he shared with joy what happened to me.</seg>
		<seg id="41">And of course, he was a small boy in my stomach.</seg>
		<seg id="42">I have loved to share this moment with it and I take pleasure to tell this common memory lived after his death.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Precisely five years ago, my grandmother died of the continuations of a cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A year beforehand, it was on journey with my family in Cuba.</seg>
		<seg id="45">It is to say the shock that his disappearance has caused at the young bachelier that I was at that time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">I have realized my mourning despite everything rapidly enough.</seg>
		<seg id="47">But it continues influence my life, notably in the moments where I feel in difficulty, or well while I must make important decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Learning the Arabic and to be interested in the Middle East, to the point of making some a master in a great school, have not been, with the retreat, insignificant choices.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Actually, I heard it often speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, there where it had lived for decades - before regaining France at the moment of the independence.</seg>
		<seg id="50">The values that she has inculcated in me are always present, so well that it happens to me to think to how she would want me to act at a given moment.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It goes from there similarly for my attitudes: I try to be to the height generosity and uprightness of mind of that who was a religious devotee.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Henceforth, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving mind</seg>
		<seg id="53">I see his eyes land on me.</seg>
		<seg id="54">My mother died nineteen maintaining years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Died after me to have spoken on the telephone.</seg>
		<seg id="56">I have passed by all the stages: the incomprehension, the anger, the pain, the tears that go off alone, anyplace, anytime, in unusual places, of the incongruous moments.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Then, the time has appeased the grief</seg>
		<seg id="58">Only the lack, this space without reply, this need of it of confiding of reassuring myself to the hollow of his softness, has remained.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Nevertheless, it is there, silent presence, it is there and looks at me.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Every morning, I see his worried eyes land on me, I see the rings that weighed down his glance, the wrinkles around the lips that the cigarettes, the folds that mark the forehead the days of anxiety, dig.</seg>
		<seg id="61">My mother has taken possession of my face and it concerns me every morning in my mirror.</seg>
		<seg id="62">And every morning, I divert the eyes.</seg>
		<seg id="63">My woman and the mother of my 3 children has died of a cancer at 43 years.</seg>
		<seg id="64">One feels his protection permanently, nothing serious can happen to us.</seg>
		<seg id="65">It was his promise on his bed of pain, then gradually one has relearned to smile, and to pronounce his name is not no more taboo but a comfort.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Well on, I talk to him in the hollow about the night when the absence overdoes it badly, it invites itself in my dreams when the morale a bit is reached.</seg>
		<seg id="67">We feel carried and protected in the difficult moments, the retreat of the time makes us realize how much it was a conductor and we try to stay in the way that it had drawn us.</seg>
		<seg id="68">If a being has loved you very loudly, the absence can not extract it from you of the heart and of the memories.</seg>
		<seg id="69">In some way, the loved being becomes your interior energy.</seg>
		<seg id="70">I have lost my father on August 22nd, 2008 of the continuations of a cancer of the asbestos.</seg>
		<seg id="71">I was very close to it always I have acted according to what he thought or of what he appreciated.</seg>
		<seg id="72">I have not been able to attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a small boy.</seg>
		<seg id="73">If I have my convictions sometimes different from hers I wonder always if my intrigues are consistent with his vision of the things.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Moreover I have had problems in my work as these convictions.</seg>
		<seg id="75">For me, it is impossible to go to a contrary sense I do not sleep and I wonder always what he will think.</seg>
		<seg id="76">I do not know if I have adopted his way of being or if I am simply as it is it genetic?</seg>
		<seg id="77">In any case, it will be always my reference.</seg>
		<seg id="78">It was a bit as an alter-ego, there was not need of speaking among us.</seg>
		<seg id="79">In short, it is there at the daily.</seg>
		<seg id="80">I feel his presence and that makes me happy.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Veiled soon thirty years that my husband has died to the age of 33 years.</seg>
		<seg id="82">I had 28 years and our son 6 years.</seg>
		<seg id="83">The immense grief that has then invaded me has of course died down but it is always close to me.</seg>
		<seg id="84">Very often it &quot;unloads&quot; to my dreams of a so precise, so alive way that to the waking I am still sadder of noticing that it was only a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="85">The other night, he has asked to me if I was fine, I have told to him not, him me reply &quot;I go down&quot; but of a so real voice that I have woken up in start, distressed and I have lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, persuaded that it was going to happen.</seg>
		<seg id="86">I live always in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I look back to see if it is not there, I know that it is it and I talk to him</seg>
		<seg id="87">In all the parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.</seg>
		<seg id="88">For nothing to the world I would not leave this house where we have been happy and or his mind lives with me.</seg>
		<seg id="89">I have 58 years, always I have lived alone for his departure, it is and will remain the love of my life.</seg>
		<seg id="90">I insist on clarifying that I am sociable with a profession to responsibility, laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I do not talk ever about it except with my son, and I do not go ever to the cemetery.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The Islamist Mohamed Morsi has promised the emergence of a «new Egypt» while it has lent the oath of investiture at the presidency, becoming thus the first freely elected president and following Hosni Moubarak that was driven away from the power 16 months earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="3">During his investiture in front of the High constitutional court Mr. Morsi also became the first Islamist president freely elected Arabic from the world and the fifth head of state of Egypt from the inversion of the monarchy 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It has lent oath in front of the 18 judges in black dress of the Court whose building trade situated in edge of the Nile has been built to look like an Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">«We aspire to better following days, a new Egypt and a second republic», has declared the president Morsi in the course of the solemn ceremony diffused en direct on the public television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">«Today, the Egyptian people have put the foundations of a new life – the absolute freedom, a real democracy and the stability», has explained Mr. Morsi, an engineer of 60 years formed in the United States, stemming from the Brothers Muslims, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years for his training as an illegal organization and in a hard way repressed by the successive governments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building trade while Mr. Morsi has arrived little after 11 hours, local hour, followed from a small convoy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Alone some hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to acclaim the new president and, distancing oneself from the presidential splendor of the years Moubarak, the circulation only briefly has not been interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the very frequented streets connecting the downtown to the suburbs south.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Considered as the «spare wheel» little charismatic of the Muslim Brothers, his prestige staff s is considerably reinforced from his victory and his speech of Friday in the course of which he has tried to appear as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those that want to finish the work started during the uprising of 2011 against the authoritarian president Moubarak.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The avionneurs scold themselves about the width of the seats even though big commands are at stake</seg>
		<seg id="1">The argument makes rage between the great aeronautical builders about the width of the seats of the tourist class on the long-courriers flights opening the way to a bitter confrontation during the aeronautical lounge of Dubai that takes place of month-here.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The conflict deals with the width of the seats proposed to the passengers of the economic class on the long-courriers flights – that are not always the most courted by the airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase the earnings of effectiveness in the last devices presented by Airbus LOCK and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This week, Airbus has called the aircraft industry to set up an imposing norm a size of seat of at least 18 thumbs (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but her big rival American Boeing declares that it should be up to the airlines to decide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The disagreement has burst even though the avionneurs look for sale for still greater versions of their long-courriers airplanes twin-engined planes, expecting possibly a record of commands during the event that will take place from 17 on November 21st.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The way of which to the seats the back of the airplane will be disposed – in particular, 9 or 10 seats will be head-on – is essential for the economic yield of the segment of the« mini-jumbo».</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing declares that his reorganized «777X» will be able to receive 406 people in economic class in seats of more than 17 thumbs of width sea, and will be configured with 10 seats by line.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus indicates that the rival version of his A350 will move 350 people in economic class in seats of 18 thumbs of width sea configured in lines of 9.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The giants of the aeronautics exchange often blows on technical questions making advertisement in the professional press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Today, Airbus disputes it directly to the public before the aeronautical lounge of Dubai, where the 777X should take the step on his competitors with more than 100 commands</seg>
		<seg id="10">One has been able to realize lately of it that could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people ones against the others to the restaurant, titled Is it that you would accept that? ».</seg>
		<seg id="11">«Boeing proposes long-courriers flights in narrower seats than in the regional turboprop airplanes», has indicated John Leahy, business manager of Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As the food habits change, the people put on weight, but the seats in the airplanes have radically not changed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the beginning of the years 1970, while the jumbo 747 of Boeing has defined the modern long-courrier journey, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American of 40 to 49 years has increased in 10 %, according to the data of the American department of the Health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The turn of size of the average American of the 21st century is of 39.7 thumbs according to the American sanitary statistics.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus declares that his rival clings to a concept of seat that dates back to the years 1950, while the circumference of the device coolly called «jet set» was narrower.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus adds that it has ordered a study that indicates that an additional thumb as regards the width of the seats would improve the quality of the sleep of 53 %.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing contests the numbers of Airbus in it that concerns the width of the seats and maintains that deciding on the way whose airlines balance the price of the tickets and the equipment is not up to the builders</seg>
		<seg id="18">He says about the seats that the study shows that the experience in cabin does not depend only on the width also.</seg>
		<seg id="19">«It is really a matter of bringing suppleness to the airlines and of allowing them to make it which they intend to have to make to see through their activities», has declared Kent Craver, assigns some of the satisfaction passengers by Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want one to tell them what will allow them to be profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They experience their firm better than nobody does.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For the passengers, it is more a matter of having some freedom of movement, but for the purveyors, it is more and more a question that could affect their results.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the argument is hidden a race to the commands of airplanes for a valued amount of at least 700 Md$ to the price of the market in the decades to come, sufficiently to make to tilt the pair of scales of the American and European exportations.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters has indicated it for the first time in July, the shape of the seats is exactly what feeds the battle between the very last devices</seg>

		<seg id="26">The performances announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats by line and a model 777 of origin configured in lines of 9.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The earnings in terms of unitary costs are weak compared with the device configured with 10 seats by line presently in operation.</seg>
		<seg id="28">«Boeing made that to be able to put more seats and to give back his more competitive airplanes by relations at our products,» has declared Kevin Keniston, manager of Temporary Comfort by the European avionneur Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Of another side, the analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats by line in the 777 existent ones suggest that of numerous passengers pronounce in favour of a denser shape which can go hand in hand with less expensive prices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">«A width of seat of 18 thumbs would be perfect for the passengers, but the reality is that, of the commercial viewpoint, the suggestion of Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777», has declared the expert in insides of cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor in leader of Runway Girl Network.</seg>

		<seg id="15">M. Hare has declared that it had expressed his viewpoint in the face of the advice of the YMCA of News-Wales of the saying South that, for the organization, the lesson gotten out of «the incident Jonathan Lord» not did not have to concern the description» by the staff, and the advice was agreed with it</seg>

		<seg id="4">For their own funeral, more and more French choose the cremation, rather that the burial: 53%, according to a study Ipsos realized on September 6th and 7th next to 1009 people, instead of 47%.</seg>
		<seg id="5">For the funeral of a close relation, it is the opposite: the French prefer the burial (53% against 47%).</seg>
		<seg id="6">If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15 % to choose the cremation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In his book The Death in ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the national Committee of ethics of the funerary one, stress the &quot;violence&quot; that the cremation constitutes, for the survivors.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is with the cremation, &quot;a violence made to the liked body&quot;, that is going to be &quot;reduced to a pile of ashes&quot; in very little of time and not after a process of decomposition, which would &quot;accompany the stages with the mourning&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There is &quot;a symbolic violence&quot; also, who keeps to the &quot;obliteration singularity and features&quot; reduced to the &quot;anonymity&quot; of the ashes.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why is what is accepted without grief in some Nordic and Protestant countries, badly lived still in France?</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Because the cremation is a new fact&quot;, replies Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of thanatology and author of the book To Tame the death.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It is tolerated only for 1963 by the Catholic Church, what has limited the attempts to tame it</seg>
		<seg id="13">Taming the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, chief executive officer of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to foresee for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which it would have right with a burial.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The annual inquiry of Ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="15">77% of the French want a, for their close relations, who it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Henceforth, 73% of the people having chosen a cremation wish for the organization of a ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="17">66% of the atheistic ones or not believers also want it</seg>
		<seg id="18">The crematoria have adapted to this evolution of the society</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;For ten years, &quot;they endeavor to avoid the violence of a waiting to the families, without making anything, for an hour and half-hour, immediately followed of the delivery of the ashes,&quot; observes Mr. Michaud-Nérard.</seg>
		<seg id="20">70% of the establishments propose henceforth masters of ceremonies, who conduct, in the presence of the body, the next ritual: receiving the assembly to name the deceased, to connect it to the others, to evoke it to give sense to his death, to organize the farewell.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is the case at the crematorium of the Father Lachaise, for 1998.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The masters of ceremony are often people who have moved.</seg>
		<seg id="23">There are also previous Catholic priests.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is in this frame that the crematorium of the Father Lachaise organizes, for 2010, on the day of All Saint's Day, several ceremonies of the memory, secular and not religious, which he invites to the families of the people who have been crématisées in the year.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Return in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents his two new choreographies of group to Dance Dance: the first one inspired of the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second one inspired with by the first-rate solos of piano Gymnopédies of Satie.</seg>
		<seg id="1">An evening that allows seeing the whole prism of Chouinard, of the art to the tics and of the black of ink to the white.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A white screen serves as wall of bottom.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Theater Maisonneuve, advances itself of profile, end as a line and dressed in black, a body.</seg>
		<seg id="4">On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is thrown.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The body, simple feature takes his form</seg>
		<seg id="6">And this form will be that of the whole part a row of physical imitations of the drawings.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The dancers, entirely dressed in black, lonely the discovered hands and face, wait of every side of the adventure playground, throw when the next written form appears, incarnate it go out again running.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in intermediary of solos, in group to the unison (a mass that makes solo), in great group of twelve solos where each carries out his sign.</seg>
		<seg id="9">One thinks about &quot;Glory of the morning&quot;, where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, put online to the apron.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is the same principle, version gigantic PowerPoint.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The energy is high, gives rhythm to it always express.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Break will be when Carol Prieur will shelter under the carpet of dance, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety nor deduction, a part of the poem of Midwhitewash, monotonous and monotonous in the auction, and will pursue dancing.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Both the music of going again, and the sequence of recovering.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This discharge sound and energetic, long, if that can itself ends up deafening and dulling.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As makes it also the regularity of the visual rhythm.</seg>
		<seg id="17">There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of pictures has always been a strength at Chouinard - as this hair that is tousled or these black tissues that lengthen the lines.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But the choreographic approach lacks composition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting from the work of Midwhitewash, has dominated, with his tics.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Result: the bodies seem to dish in the face of the drawings.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The inks of Midwhitewash, as forms of Gestalt, open an imaginary one wider and giboyeux than the dance, more porous.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Only the end, in negative, with his dancers chopped by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a theater in a sudden way black, touch to the magic.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The public has loved, the reception was warm.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Gymnopédies, after the interlude, is richer.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The scene in part is draped of gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with tissues, as furniture in a neglected house.</seg>
		<seg id="26">At the piano, dancers are relieved to play the partitions.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Their clumsiness in music, touching, gives a true fragility.</seg>
		<seg id="28">On stage, the couples pass, in passionate, very sensual, even erotic duos.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Work of group, small solos of transitions, unity that moves, choirs, the writing is less binary.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Clowns appear, also familiar with Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in passionate parades men-women very polarized.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The loves are carnivorous, evasive or players.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The gestural one, the laughs and the small shouts transpose bellement the archaic one, the grace and the absurdity of the bodies in coitus, of the beings who found themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But the part takes his real takeoff after the salvation.</seg>
		<seg id="34">A clown comes back in scene when the public leaves.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth grave wall, the explored universes are superimposed, the dancers playact, go down among the spectators, annotate, smoke, are short-circuited, act codes of the clappings, stretch the sauce in a disorder in a scholarly way calculated that remains sensual.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The joy and the madness sweat, and contaminating the public is the art of Chouinard, there.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has shyly been kept within the QG of campaign of Chicago and inside the oval Office</seg>

		<seg id="9">«I have said that I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them», has declared Daley to the newspaper.</seg>

		<seg id="6">After ten years of silence (the last disk, Reality, date of 2003) and of too much rare appearances in public, the English musician proved that still one could count on it to make the scene sparkle pop.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A feast for his fans</seg>
		<seg id="8">Not weary of the surprises, David Bowie had more than one turn in his bag with The Next Day.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Thin White Duke has thus planned to republish this album, on November 4th.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For the occasion he has concocted a true feast for his fans.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will appear under the form of three disks: the original album, of the sessions studio unpublished and of the remix, as a DVD containing the four already unveiled clips.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Next Day Extra will contain altogether ten additional titles in relation to the original album: the three pieces of the edition Deluxe, five songs especially unveiled for the occasion as two remix.</seg>

		<seg id="18">The Informer, Like In Rocket Man, Born In HAS UFO are them also available on the canvas</seg>
		<seg id="19">The Informer belongs to copy-face: a worrying intro before a luminous stampede that slows down progressively to leave place to a ballad pop.</seg>
		<seg id="20">On Like In Rocket Man, has Bowie wanted to make the Rocket Man of Elton John, indeed even Gravity a small reference?</seg>
		<seg id="21">With this cheerful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when it does not have the feet anymore on earth</seg>
		<seg id="22">Space Oddity, nearby, was much more serious.</seg>
		<seg id="23">On Born In HAS UFO, David Bowie makes a new time reference to his strangeness: would it come from another planet?</seg>
		<seg id="24">The riffs of guitar, bewitching, give desire of leaving the Earth</seg>
		<seg id="25">Bowie enjoys itself playing at the chameleon with these titles in any case: in turn informer, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...</seg>
		<seg id="26">It conceals and reveals at the same time, plays at adopting different personalities, as it has made it throughout his career notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Nothing of surprising to what it has therefore a mask by hand in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to the Journey, of the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face it incarnates.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10th.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is the European elite ready to make businesses with Great Britain?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Business campaign heart Britain has been thrown in April with the promise of gathering the firms and of defining it which the creators of riches and of jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">For it to make, we have ordered the inquiry the widest and the most complete next to the British leaders of firm and have asked to them for what they thought of the Great Britain, of the firms and of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov has questioned more than 1 000 leaders of firm globalement representative of all the sizes of firms of the sectors and regions of Great Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The conclusions of the inquiry will be a surprise for a lot.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have discovered that the vast majority of firms try henceforth to export outside Europe, concentrating on the countries that are modernized and develop while the States of the EU stagnate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want to see the government rather give the priority to new commercial connections to countries as China, India and Brazil that of sinking into the long and arduous process of reform of the European institutional mysteries</seg>
		<seg id="7">While one asks them for their opinion on specific political points – going from the rules of the monopolies at the laws on the products – the majority of leaders of firm think that the control of these key abilities should return to the hands of Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The single market has occasioned a general dissatisfaction, the firms saying that the cost of the Brussels regulations is disproportioned in relation to the advantages that are to be part of the European zone of exchanges – 40 % of the great firms traditionally the most pro-European, are even agreed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Finally, and what is more talking still, our inquiry next to the leaders of firm has revealed that an important majority wanted to see Great Britain hound the initiatives in favor of a change in the treaty and in the development with a relationship with the EU based on the business and not the policy</seg>
		<seg id="10">This conclusion, which meets itself in all the great groups and the firms of all sizes shows that the world of the firm insists for a «significant change» that returns the power in the United Kingdom.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are raised – to manage to change the treaty and better to represent the interests of Great Britain would allow of seeing a rocking movement of 16 % of the votes in favor of the maintenance of the country in the EU during a referendum.</seg>

		<seg id="1">At a pretor on security of the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts down a bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in gold to pay the expenses of schooling of his girls</seg>
		<seg id="2">«My husband and I have just bought a house therefore all my money has left inside», declares Mme Amirthalinga.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although it earns 3 000 $ of Singapore (2 400 $) by month as administrator and that his husband also works, the monthly family income does not suffice, it says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Actually, the request is such an in some parts of Southeast Asia – where the indebtedness of the households increases – that ValueMax, where she has carried out his transaction, has become this week the third society of loans on security to be introduced to the grant of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="5">To put jewels in security is not only a fast means of obtaining spot cash – 1 300 $ of Singapore in the case of Mme Amirthalinga – but it is nearly as a good market as the not guaranteed bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In general, the pretors on security of Singapore remove a real annual interest rate of 17 %, just above the 15.4 % ones offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local backer having a branch in the same shopping center.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, the pretors on security have the advantage of not asking for verification of solvency or proof of salary, and can unblock the loans more rapidly than the banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Consequently, millions of people across the region turn to the pretors on security even though the families feel the pressure that exercises the increase of the cost of living and the excessive debt of the households and of the consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of solid growth from the financial world crisis, and the good credit market fed by a monetary policy too much lax in the advanced economics, the families to weak and average income turn to the pretors on security to fill in the difference even though their economics experience a slowing down.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week, the agency of notation Switchboard &amp; Poor's has quoted the increasing indebtedness of the households following from the rise of the hypothecary loans, as a factor of risk for the solvency of the Asian banks, principally.</seg>
		<seg id="11">She has declared that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the indebtedness ratio of the households domestic product the most raised of Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia arrives in chief candidate with 80 % of the GDP, even though this rate rose to 60 % in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The economists fear also the high level of indebtedness of the consumers in Thailand, which is gone out of little this week of a technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Thursday, data have shown a weakness continues of the exportations and a slowing down of the request for the consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="15">«The assessment is that with the rise of the costs, the people in the middle or to the bottom [of the salary scale] try» to complete their incomes «as they can», declares Song Seng Wun, economist by CIMB, a bank malaisienne.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The prices historically put up of the gold in the course of the two last years have made that the people have hastened to put their personal effects in security to touch the value in cash of their jewels.</seg>
		<seg id="17">At Singapore, about 70 % of the articles put in security in the 200 stores of loan on security of the city-state are in gold.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The people say, «the price of the gold is raised, let's put in security the chain in gold of grandmother and one will come back to look for it next month».</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand, the greatest operator of stores of loan on security, EasyMoney, has recorded a rise of 20 % of the number of customers using his stores in the course of the last months.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The rise is such an in the sector of the loan on security that ValueMax, operator of the store to Bendemeer and of 15 other stores as this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in the neighboring Malaysia – where he already counts four stores – but also outside Asia, declares Yeah Lee Ching, his general manager.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The society will finance them using 60 % of the 66 M$ of Singapore that it has raised this week during his introduction to the grant of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some pretors to reduced rate have dried the criticisms for the exorbitant interest rates that they practise, Miss Yeah indicates that the pawning offers not only of the rates less raised than the other pretors, but that besides it does not increase the debt directly.</seg>
		<seg id="23">«The customers mortgage goods that they already possess, and the fact of monetizing their personal goods does not increase the indebtedness of the households it says.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The pawning is of better in better accepted socially than means of obtaining a financing guaranteed in the short term.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Neither the people who go to the pretors on security are not those that have financial problems only.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The easy people of Singapore go also in the stores of loan on security ValueMax to put pawns ingots of gold or watches Rolex, which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see customers of all the coats of the society</seg>
		<seg id="28">«They can be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small firms that have needs of funds to pass a difficult cape», it adds Miss Yeah.</seg>

		<seg id="5">Basharat Ditta, 42 years, gave sensitive information to the lord of the crime Neil Scarbrough regarding inquiries on his activities related to the drug traffic after s to be compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The lawyer which was nicknamed «Bash» and considered by the criminals as one« file of first importance», has been stopped at his place in 2011 subsequent to operations of listening of the police directed towards Scarborough, which it had represented during a previous trial in connection with the drug trafficking.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The officials of police have spotted Sarborough, 32 years, at putting down three bags of cocaine at the domicile of the lawyer at Blackburn, in the Lancashire, even though he attended a dinner of the Bar with colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The inquiries have revealed that Ditta was a «regular consumer» of this drug of class A after tests have shown traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Towards a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he has tried to obtain information from illicit way on the arrest of two men for the account of Scarborough as one of his associates.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The four suspects were watched at that time by the police within the framework of an important inquiry on a traffic of heroine and of cocaine taking place in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
		<seg id="11">With 32 other men, thereafter they have been imprisoned after the police have seized heroine and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 M£, as more than 200 000 lb in cash in the course of a series of raids.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Ditta, 42 years, supplied information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction is revealed at the broad daylight.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today, to the crown court of Liverpool, Ditta, that works in the office of lawyers Forbes Solicitors situated to Blackburn, has fallen in disgrace after having been pleaded guilty on two leaders of accusation of hindrance to the justice after a trial of three weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He had admitted the possession of cocaine in the course of a previous audience.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The fall of the lawyer has occurred after the police, holding an inquiry on Scarborough, have discovered that it had been regularly telephonic in contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two investigators have followed the suspect and have spotted it arriving to the domicile of Ditta and putting drug, pure to 60 %, under the garbage cans of the lawyer in a glove of black golf.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Little time after the deposit, Scarborough has been regularly telephonic in contact with Ditta that was at a dinner at the stadium of foot of Ewood Park, wall of the club of the Blackburn Rovers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer has returned to it has discovered the drug and they have phoned themselves to nine resumptions.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The court has understood that Ditta was a «regular consumer» of cocaine after tests have shown traces of this drug of class A in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta has been stopped later but he has denied to consume cocaine. He has declared that he had talked to the trafficker of drug presumed because it was his customer and has brought out that their discussions were subjected to a «legal privilege».</seg>
		<seg id="21">In the course of his arrest, Ditta has picked up his wallet and has tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they all have been seized and one has removed a sample of hair from it</seg>
		<seg id="22">During a cross-examination, he has declared that it possessed an office to his domicile, as to his workplace and that it happened that customers call it at his place for questions of legal order.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the court has heard testimonies according to which he called major actors in the business of the drug, of which some that it had represented, after key arrests for their statement what investigators knew.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The prosecutor Anne Whyte has declared: «If somebody must know that the law must not be violated, he is well a penologist lawyer »</seg>
		<seg id="25">M. Ditta is a penologist, marked of having abused his position as lawyer and of being too much implied itself next to particular customers.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relationship that we talk about is simply not a trafficker of drug, but a trafficker of drug supplying drug to his own lawyer</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of his communications will be undoubtedly legitimate communications because it was his lawyer</seg>
		<seg id="28">But that has been fine beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his customer.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It has hindered the inquiry of the police as far as he has been able to allow him to pursue his criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">M. Ditta has not been an honor to his profession, but he has dishonored it</seg>

		<seg id="33">But after the audience, the superbursar Lee Halstead de la Police of the Lancashire has declared: «Mr. Ditta has passed of penologist lawyer to criminal itself ever since that he has started obtaining drug next to criminal organizations. »</seg>
		<seg id="34">His addiction to the cocaine has compromised it forever and has made it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of the organized criminal groups that have it responsible to obtain precious information regarding inquiries from police.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and institute a climate in trust next to the public.</seg>
		<seg id="36">M. Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to shelter behind the varnish from his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The unity loaded with the crime engraves and organized of the Lancashire has led the inquiry on Mr. Ditta, who has been pleaded guilty of the three leaders of accusation of possession of cocaine and maintaining of hindrance to the justice revealing his commitment to pursue the criminals in justice</seg>
		<seg id="38">That this business serves as warning for the criminals so that they know that nobody is above the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and will translate you in front of the courts.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough has itself been imprisoned for 14 years after having pleaded guilty of complicity of traffic of heroine, of cocaine and of cannabis.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Thirty-five other people involved in the traffic have been sentenced to a total of 153 years of prison for drug trafficking.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On his site, Ditta has organized a session of questions/replies on itself in the course of which he said that his job of dream would be of being lawyer to represent customers in the corridor of the death as America, her last dinner invited would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would be what would motivate him to work.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Center of health and social services (CSSS) of Laval has caused a whole emotion at the direction of the Hospital of the Cité-de-la-Santé, and it, during the year 2012-2013.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Because of numerous departures to the retirement of leaves of maternity or of departures everything runs, the department of drugstore has felt strongly poor in staff.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It lacked close to 30% the necessary staff, making this financial year &quot;very difficult&quot;, according to the leader of the department, Gillian Beaudet.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Though, the CSSS has decided not to engage independent labor, which can cost until three times fullness dearer than a pharmacist engaged in time.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One has not had resort to the fixing, has explained Mme Beaudet.</seg>
		<seg id="6">One has rationalized or reduced some of our activities inside the establishment for landing, the time that the things are replaced.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is sure about one having worked strong to interest our youths [residents in drugstore] so that they come and stay here.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There is a competition of circumstances that has made that one was the past year in a bad situation.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Improved situation</seg>
		<seg id="10">After this arduous period, the year 2013-2014 looks clearly easier for the department of drugstore of the CSSS.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Already, three pharmacists are back to the work after their leave of maternity and three other pharmacists have been hired in the course of the last months.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Furthermore, the efforts deployed by the department in order to keep have carried fruits, because the four présentement students in residence to Laval have also decided to stay to the job of the CSSS.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Now, that goes much better, has underlined the pharmacist.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Of here the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three returns of maternity.</seg>

		<seg id="16">Needs always croissants</seg>

		<seg id="18">Several factors as the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or a predominance of young women in the profession, give back such situations that that lived in 2012 difficult to foresee.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because one has an environment that is young and one uses many young women, therefore with the pregnancies, one rolls nearly always to three leaves of maternity when that is fine, it has added.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Last year, one has had much more and one does not have pharmacists who are available for making substitutions, therefore it was more difficult.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The survivors and the close relations of the 202 people killed in the attacks of Bali in 2002 have reacted with anger to the grief pronounced contrary to the latter of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years in escape being one of the men most searched for of Southeast Asia, has been yesterday sentenced to a grief of 20 years of prison for his role in the fabrication of the explosive devices used during the attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It could be freed at the end of 15 years under conditional release.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The man of 45 years has been pleaded guilty of killings of mass for the attacks aiming at two nightclubs in the touristic working class area of Kuta, which has caused the death of 202 people, of which 88 Australians, and have been numerous casualties.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It has also been pleaded guilty of numerous other leaders of accusation in connection with the terrorism, notably a wave of attacks aiming at churches in the whole Indonesia to the Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The prosecutors have asked for a grief of imprisonment forever, nevertheless they would have been able to ask to what the man, described as «Demolition Man» for his reputation of expert in fabrication of bombs, is sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision has revived hard memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth that has lost his two twins of 39 years, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the edge of the tears, she has declared that Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I really think that it should have followed the same path as the other men.</seg>
		<seg id="10">«It should be dragged in front of the firing squad», has declared Mme Corteen to the AAP.</seg>

		<seg id="16">In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To keep it in life, why, there is not any reason of keeping it in life.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Spending 20 years in prison after having killed 202 people and hurt hundreds of others, it is not a lot.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the latter of the posers of bomb of Bali to be brought to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It had succeeded in avoiding being made capture nearly for 10 years but finally has been stopped in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American strengths will kill the previous leader of Al-Qaïda, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.</seg>

		<seg id="2">A request officially made not to run any risk on the responsibility of the urgency in Paris at the beginning of the winter but who aimed also at not bothering the campaign of the PS at some months of the municipal ones.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In spite of the ministerial orders, the closing should all the same be real at this date.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Even if, at the APHP, one prefers to use the term of &quot;transformation&quot; or of &quot;change in the continuity&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As from November 4th, the pompiers that assured a quarter of the 40 000 annual passages to the urgency of the Hotel-God auront about everyone receipt for orders of carrying the thirty serious cases a day to the urgency of other Parisian hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This date of November 4th corresponds also to the renewal of the boarding schools officers.</seg>
		<seg id="7">At the Hotel-God, the boarders specialized in urgency will leave place Monday to five boarders of general practice.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As for the transfer of the beds of internal medicine, it is programmed for the current of the month.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;The service of reception of the urgency of the Hotel-God must close in the briefest deadline, and for us, it is on November 4th&quot;, insures without bend Loïc Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the project of the direction</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;On November 4th, more patients taken by the firefighters, uniquely of the people coming by their average specificity will not be confirms the teacher Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical person in charge of the new Hotel-God.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;But we will continue receive patients in urgency&quot;, it tempers, bringing out the permanent presence of vehicles of the SMUR on site to transfer the serious cases.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Senior urgentistes doctors will stay on site, it assures also.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But it is to the ARS that deciding the closing of the service of reception of the urgency corresponds.</seg>

		<seg id="29">In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, to recommend UMP of Paris and elected representative of the 4th district, announces clearly that &quot;even if the Parisian UMP was urgency for the maintenance to the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if one comes back to the responsibilities&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, has as for it again reminded Monday morning on France Inter that it had pronounced in favour of a moratorium so that closing is not on November 4th.</seg>
		<seg id="31">If it was the case, it would mark his net disagreement, underlines Bruno Julliard, his spokesperson.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Phenomenon of the French edition Gérard of Villiers, died Thursday at 83 years, came very fair of publishing his 200th LOCK, &quot;The Revenge of the Kremlin&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In February, the New York Times had hallowed it as &quot;the author of spy thrillers who knew some too much&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He had just spent then ten days in Afghanistan, theater of the 198 and 199th opuses of the famous series of spy thrillers.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Reduced physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, it moved during this journey with a walker.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And before Afghanistan, it had also gone in Libya, in Russia, to Lebanon and to Mali again.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With four LOCKS published per annum, Gérard of Villiers, born on December 8th, 1929 in Paris, assured to ignore the exact number of books sold for 1965 and the publication of &quot;LOCK to Istanbul&quot;, the first of the series, it is close to a half century.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;No doubt between 120 and 150 a million all countries mixed up&quot;, it advanced in March last.</seg>
		<seg id="9">His Myanma cat on the knees, in the lounge of his immense apartment of a building of the avenue Foch to two steps of the Arch of Triumph, the mischievous eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Without counting the editions pirates&quot;, it added, referring to a stack of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or the ivories brought back of the 130 countries surveyed to situate his novels there.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader has right to the traditional blanket with the photo of a young woman at the worthwhile chest, carrying a pistol or a rifle of assault.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Inside, his sérénissime highness (LOCK) the prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat left broke and contractual agent of the CIA to pay the repairings of the castle of family, launches to the cases of all the spiteful ones of the earth communists of the years 70 and 80, then jihadistes from the years 90.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At every book, the same recipe: a great dose of geopolitics and of exoticism, some hard scenes of sex, a zest of violence and of tortures.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Never I have had the pretension of being a literary author&quot;, explained Gérard of Villiers.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I consider myself as a storyteller who writes to divert people to whom I do not send message.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He worked &quot;as the great reporters of before war, of the type Albert Londres, who went on site and came back with true and long inquiries&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The father of LOCK said &quot;to make a kind of serial geopolitical&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;I am permanently my files (Afghanistan, Syria...) before leaving&quot;, added Gérard of Villiers.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On site, I meet journalists, of which those of the AFP, of the diplomats, of the people of the services that I know for certain for twenty or thirty years.</seg>
		<seg id="20">An, as a result, number of his LOCKS are often premonitory: as thus, a month before the attack of a center of command of the Syrian system had killed several responsible tops, it had told the history in &quot;The Path of Damascus&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In &quot;The Madmen of Benghazi&quot;, it had been the first to reveal the existence of a center of secret command of the CIA in this city, cradle of the Libyan revolt.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In 1980, he directed the murder of the Egyptian president Anouar El-Sadate in &quot;The plot of Cairo&quot;, a year before the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In October 2012, in &quot;Panic in Bamako&quot;, it related the columns of 4X4 of jihadistes that melted on the Malian capital.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I am not a seer, defended Gérard of Villiers, I make simply hypotheses from country that I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses are realized.</seg>
		<seg id="25">After these journeys in often disturbed zones, he settled for a month behind his IBM typewriter at daisy dating back to 1976 &quot;all the parts of which have been changed&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="26">300 pages more late, it wrote the word &quot;END&quot; and corrected every page to the pen.</seg>
		<seg id="27">To the walls of his office are hooked of the rifles of assault AK-47, of the erotic photos and of the photos of the author with African lords of war.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Regularly pinned for male chauvinism by feminist leagues and for racism by organizations of the human rights, Gérard of Villiers removed these accusations in two sentences.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and brave women.</seg>
		<seg id="30">I am well received always in Africa where I count very numerous readers.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Gérard of Villiers had said it: &quot;Malko Linge, as all the heroes, does not have age&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="32">He will not die and will not leave in retirement</seg>
		<seg id="33">Not more that me.</seg>
