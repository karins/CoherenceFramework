		<seg id="0">The NSA case underscores the total lack of debate on intelligence</seg>
		<seg id="1">How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand, the public is frustrated by summoning the US ambassador on October 21, and the other prohibits the overflight by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumour of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?</seg>
		<seg id="2">According to me, there are two levels of response from the French government.</seg>
		<seg id="3">When François Hollande phone to Barack Obama, or when the Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius summoned the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the size of the American surveillance on all communications in France.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It is not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks on the one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the Quai D'orsay eavesdropping by the NSA?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Is there not as a wave of hypocrisy from you?</seg>
		<seg id="6">The journalistic process is not a moral position, but research interest and relevance of information to enable every citizen to form an opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When Wikileaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy for political or other issues around the world, we believe that, in the light of American power, this is a major lighting.</seg>
		<seg id="8">When we describe the U.S. interception systems against the French diplomacy in the United States, it is in any case to be outraged at this practice is to describe the world as it is.</seg>
		<seg id="9">France has benefited from information supplied by the NSA on terrorist operations against our interests?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Can we deny the American collaboration?</seg>
		<seg id="11">The establishment since roughly ten years of technological tools to intercept very powerful in the United States, but also by France, was officially justified by the fight against terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moreover, in this field, France and the United States have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described by both sides as critical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Washington was reported to the French thanks to the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="14">France can be conducted, for example, to send entire blocks of data on the Sahel region of the U.S., and in exchange-already quickly said, Americans can give information to the French on other parts of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="15">So the question of substance behind the NSA case is not so much the capacity or the right of countries to develop tools to intercept, that the question of the total absence of prior debate, notably in the parliaments, the justification of such systems, which must be theirs, and, in the end, the issue of attacks on freedoms.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That is a real risk that the United States? a degradation of their image?</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is fine to denounce them, I don't see how they can be punished.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The risk for the Americans can be double.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The first is when their allies - and that was the case recently-learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest levels of their state, were monitored.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries with diplomatic relations with the United States are strained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Another effect can be more economical to him: as more European or South American Companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data for US contractors subject to American laws, and thus the influence of the NES.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The last element: the vast movement of revelations by the world's media, which contributes to initiate a debate on the surveillance practices of the intelligence services of hitherto almost non-existent, could push the legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the credentials that they have given to their intelligence services.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Barack Obama receives the Iraqi prime minister, in full spate of violence</seg>
		<seg id="1">The American president was to receive on Friday 1 November 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, seeking U.S. help to combat the greatest wave of violence for five years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Iraq has experienced in October the most deadly month for five and a half years, according to figures released Friday, November 1, by the Iraqi authorities.</seg>
		<seg id="3">964 people have died in the violence in October, whose 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers and 1,600 people were injured.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The UN provides a stock even higher with 979 deaths and 1,902 injured.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The violence is most deadly despite tightened security measures and military operations launched last month by the government of Nouri Al-maliki, dominated by Shiites.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.</seg>
		<seg id="7">About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence raised fears of a new conflagration as neighboring Syria is engulfed in a civil war.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The bombs struck markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Men are killed in the street or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The growing discontent among the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being marginalized politically and to be the target of unjust arrests, led to the outbreak of violence.</seg>
		<seg id="11">On Friday, new violence killed four people in the north of Iraq, in the aftermath of the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the detonation of five car bombs north of Baghdad.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nouri al Maliki wants a &quot;global war&quot; Against Al-qaida.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The violence is at the centre of discussions in the United States the Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="15">At the time, the American president, elected on the promise to put an end to the military engagement in the country, had painted an optimistic picture of the situation.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Since his arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nouri al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive and the elected members of Congress.</seg>
		<seg id="17">On Thursday, he pleaded for the international community leads a &quot;third world war&quot; Against Al-qaida.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The principle of increased aid to Iraq's security is supported by influential senators, Republicans and Democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But they also criticized Nouri al Maliki, a Shiite, granting him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his &quot;sectarian and authoritarian politics.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="20">They also demanded President Barack Obama that he will make it clear to Nouri al Maliki that &quot;the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">The new vaccine could remove the pleasure cravings to smoke</seg>
		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed a vaccine that cravings could remove the pleasure that it takes to smoke a cigarette.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One dose of the vaccine could protect life of nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further testing is needed before testing on humans, but Dr. Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs were encouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,&quot; said Cornell professor.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design antibodies cravings.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus infects selectively liver cells, which then began to produce a steady stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies are tracking all the molecules of nicotine in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker to have her dose of nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In tests, the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine then continued their normal activity.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But the mice that were not vaccinated &quot;abated&quot;, said the researchers, signs that the nicotine had reached their brain.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The previous vaccines against tobacco proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The injections were to be repeated so frequently that the antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells with antibody factories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professor Crystal said that if the vaccine for human use was completely safe, there could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They know that if they start smoking again, they will take no pleasure because the vaccine cravings, and it could help them lose their bad habit,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists said the findings were interesting, but noted that much more research was needed.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The former New South Wales Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the anti-corruption regulator of the state.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied having changed the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the area controlled by the government.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has expanded its investigation to determine whether Mr Obeid had lobbied several ministers of the state to renew its leases at Circular Quay, where Obeid has two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without a call for tender.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Now it is investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of the secret Mr Obeid's interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former deputy secretary general of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">During years of discussions initiated in 2005, the Government has pushed for the leases are a call for tender.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The tenants were against and also wanted more time.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not place a call using their mobile phone)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door-to-door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music-but not speak on their mobile phone-under the new long-awaited guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect immediate changes.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another, said the FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their planes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated training manuals of crew members and rules regarding the placement of the devices to be in compliance.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said it had already received some airlines plans to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and Jetblue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;According to the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices in the very near future,&quot; the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane's doors are closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They are not supposed to reignite them before the plane reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and that the commander gives its green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The passengers are supposed to put their devices in the descent of the plane before landing and not restart them until the plane landed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the new guidelines, the airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs, landings and rolling on the ground, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most of the new planes and other aircraft that were modified so that passengers can use the Internet to higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said it was pleased with the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Once the new policy implementation in safety - and we will work in close collaboration with carriers for that-it will be beneficial to everyone,&quot; Glading said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We are frankly tired of us feel like &quot;supervisors&quot; when it comes to this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But he will always be allowed to connect to the internet to surf, exchanging emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Still no words with friends, play online Scrabble style in which the actor Alec Baldwin plays on his smartphone in 2011 when he was deported on an American Airlines flight after he refused to turn off his camera while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And the heavier devices like laptops will still be classified because it could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The regulatory power of the phones is for the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The FAA can lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, the National Transportation Safety Board expert on CBS News, said that the phones were still seen as presenting a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, they could disrupt mobile phone masts if they are used on board,&quot; Rosenker said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An Industry Advisory Committee, established by the FAA to review the issue recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to relax the restrictions on their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as Senator Claire Mccaskill, D-MO.), argue that there is no security reason for these bans.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become pervasive.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies suggest that at least a third of the passengers forget to turn off their appliances, or deliberately.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA has started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interference with navigation instruments and communication when passengers carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The new jets, far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airlines allow passengers to use wi-fi to cruising altitudes for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The aircraft modified for wi-fi systems also resistant to interference.</seg>

		<seg id="1">When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.</seg>
		<seg id="2">My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed late and we dress up to go to the neighborhood.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Today, I have become more stingy.</seg>
		<seg id="4">These last two years, I have not distributed a single sweet and I will certainly not this year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the stats show that I am the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The majority of Americans - 158 million of them, in fact-will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">What I look forward to every Halloween, what are the trends.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The costumes should represent $1.2 B on the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This year, the sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Women no longer need to be professional, sexy; they can also be sexy foods such as pizza, hamburgers and carrots.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series &quot;The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men in the area of Daft Punk will be among our Instagram photos this year.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Google, the most popular costumes are the zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I suppose it does not hurt to remain.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In fact, Americans will spend $330 million in animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">When it comes to sweets, they pile up.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year on candy, according to the Nielsen office.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This is about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It's a super news for 41 million children who go hunting for the candy in their neighbourhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In fact, we are going to buy and, let us be honest, consume 41 million kg of chocolate for Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The candy corn are the only thing that does not want to eat, and yet almost 16 million kg sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
		<seg id="23">This is about $9 billion of corn kernels.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is a mystery that I am not yet arrived.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nothing is more representative of the Halloween haunted houses.</seg>
		<seg id="26">They have the best names such as &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which is actually a real prison), &quot;howl-o-scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to the America Haunts, and that includes these wonderful pictures of you pee on you that your friends are on Facebook and you can't remove and which type you prefer to leave a &quot;pretty head.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">Finally, talking of pumpkins.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Charlie Brown gave us the big pumpkin when we were kids, and carve a pumpkin lantern, it's like decorating a Christmas tree-it is something one does, since it is very small.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fortunately for us, the &quot;tendency of Bébé-citrouille&quot; began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have carved the pumpkins and has not had to sit inside.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This year, Americans will spend about $106 million in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The citrouilles-lanternes which wilt gently on the porch of the house, presumably from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins have been cultivated this year.</seg>
		<seg id="33">If you are looking to you to point out more, call Tim and Susan mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to carve their pumpkin 922 kg.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Diehard fans of the 23 million, representing a few hundred fighters, were severed nearly 2000 metres altitude on the farm hills in Runyonyi and Chanzu, Mbuzi, relatives of Bunagana and Jomba, about 80 kilometres north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night&quot;, told AFP a resident of Jomba, reached by telephone around 12:30, and according to which a young girl was injured by gunfire in the morning.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;The intensity of clashes has dropped a bit,&quot; he added, &quot;It seems that the FARDC Armed forces repelled a rebel.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to this witness, who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had &quot;spent the night&quot; in Jomba before climbing to the front for a &quot;sweep operation&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It was very much behind him crackling fed small arms.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Bunagana, political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebels fell on Wednesday, an AFP reporter could hear heavy weapons detonations.</seg>
		<seg id="7">According to a source at the UN mission for the stabilization of the DRC, the fighting came &quot;in a final phase,&quot; the FARDC &quot;surrounded the remaining 23 positions to dislodge them.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since the resumption, on Friday, clashes between the Movement of March 23 (23) and the military, the MONUSCO is not directly involved in the fighting, but it provides a crucial support to government troops in intelligence, planning and observation.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At the end of the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, rode at the front line.</seg>
		<seg id="10">They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana border post with Uganda, the military helped AGO13 civilians a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new truck of FARDC, to ensure the succession of another spacecraft pounding 23 positions on the hills.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, on Wednesday evening, called again on the rebels to &quot;demobilize voluntarily or be disarmed by force,&quot; but left open the process from Kampala, Kinshasa and the M23 discuss since December without results for the moment.</seg>
		<seg id="13">On the spot, the political leaders of the M 23 hoping to reach an agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;We ended the talks, it only remains for the mediation of Uganda to organize the signature,&quot; said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the delegation of 23 million, but that information could be immediately confirmed by the government side.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The M23 is born of a mutiny in April 2012, former rebels, mostly Tutsi, integrated into the Army in 2009 after a peace agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The UN and Kinshasa regularly accused Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The North is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and a basement full of mineral resources.</seg>

		<seg id="1">At the foot of the statue of founding president, Samora Machel of Mozambique, to laugh at them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chanting peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want peace, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, general manager of an investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Concern for the future of her country, she shared her work clothes against a T-shirt bearing the words &quot;We want security&quot; in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The rebel movement Renamo was once a famous, initially supported by Rhodesia governed by white and then the apartheid government of South Africa in the framework of efforts to destabilize the country's independent Government.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it has become an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The analysts believe that the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken the foreign investors and the local population.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stakes are high for the growing economy since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the Northwest could attract more than 50 billion investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Italy's ENI and Anadarko of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo says that the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack against its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo, on 17 October.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The assault on the former rebels then erupted when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for Renamo, according to the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government makes the Renamo leader to have triggered the conflicts, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr Guebuza said on Wednesday the AFP, the French news agency, that Mr Dhlakama is regarded as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;all forces that he was still trying to prove that it could impose its decisions to the government.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the FT that he meant that the accord was not respected by Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;These are two great men (Guebuza and Frelimo) who do not stop to argue,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them knows how to negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reform, had already said that it will boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt to move a patient to obtain concessions and a war chest from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The share of votes collected by RENAMO steady decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, should get a larger number of votes in the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr. Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza - who is expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year-wanted to destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, it does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the presidency,&quot; Mr. Mazanga said.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is not clear what is the ability of the Renamo, but she led disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred miles north of Maputo, Beira, but where is the port where mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, exporting coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the rail line.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would reiterate this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability has strengthened the frustrations with the government, said Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent wave of kidnappings.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that the future of the country are the government and the president, and that is to find solutions to problems,&quot; he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Nobody cares about the Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want peace, they want to have a free access to the roads,&quot; he added.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Coulson has used the telephone hacking to verify a pipe</seg>
		<seg id="1">The former editor of News of the World, Andy Coulson had used &quot;the phone hacking, surveillance and the confrontation&quot; trying to confirm a phony pipe on a route involving the interior minister, Charles Clarke.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her &quot;pretty special adviser.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective to hack the voicemail of Pawlby and &quot;planted permanently in front of her door&quot;, but Coulson also called and left voice messages.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The prosecution suggest that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NOTW, is not the kind of man to remain in front of the house people hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to love the story to people to see what they have to say,&quot; Mr. Edis said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He said that NOTW used three methods to investigate topics: the phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is clear that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But what about the first?</seg>
		<seg id="9">He is aware of the phone hacking?</seg>
		<seg id="10">He claims the opposite, but we say &quot;of course.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">The rumors about an affair involving Clarke were taken first by the editorial office of NOTW when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to miss Pawlby, said he had been told: &quot;Do not lose your time with her, she is with Charles.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">A band, which recorded pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The investigators also found on the computer seized from the private detective that Miss Pawlby and his sister in a record &quot;projects.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">The federal government maintains that the bailout plan of $325 million for the ailing health care system comes with strict conditions to ensure that the Government of the State funds are not wasted.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking &quot;urgent measures&quot; to end a crisis caused by the aging of the population of the island state, the high rates of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The financing, expected over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government has proposed an emergency bailout plan that we believe will solve the unique challenges the state faces,&quot; Ms Plibersek said today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The $325 million includes a $31 million campaign for elective surgery.</seg>
		<seg id="6">2,600 additional operations, especially in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to reduce the backlog.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Funds are also earmarked for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care, the training of medical, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments will respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat the health system of Tasmania,&quot; Ms Plibersek said.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Minister said the Tasmanian Government would face a strict regime of reporting and accountability.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where we spend the extra funds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A commission composed of three people will be established to ensure that the state provides the most effective and efficient way possible.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much, &quot;unless they are followed by a real reform to strengthen the public health system of Tasmania.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, he commended the Government for having responded to the request for emergency help to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute significantly to the public health system of Tasmania from the black list,&quot; said Mr Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the State Government, these additional emergency procedures to reverse much of the recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the spokesman for the Opposition Health Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is a &quot;a makeshift solution.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason why we are here is that the Labour government of the state withdrew $430 million of its health care system,&quot; he said on ABC TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">We cannot have a state government that snatches nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth, which is $300 million, and claim that it is a good day.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr. Dutton visited Ms Plibersek to ensure that each dollar of bailout plan will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">He walks in the mud, the jungle and crosses rivers for free medical care</seg>
		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all of their weekends to see hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are not many doctors in this West African nation, barely 1 in 5,000 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or via your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of 10 CNN Hero of the Year 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 Heroes, to elect &quot;CNN Hero of the Year.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">This person will receive $250,000 for his extraordinary work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father alternating periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the beginning, he had a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that had spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would bear the consequences for the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There was no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle..</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have taken abroad if we had enough money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in Crowded hospitals and clinics, for any treatment he could benefit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not easy,&quot; adds Mr. Bwelle..</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can leave the house at 5 a.m., you rush to the hospital for the first, and you're not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">People can die because they wait too long.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation has not changed much since the death of the father of Dr. Bwelle in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">By comparison, the U.S. ratio is one doctor for 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure in the private sector.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; explained Dr. Bwelle..</seg>
		<seg id="24">And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">After seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and her team of volunteers had performed more than 700 surgical procedures for free over the last year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ascovime, who travels to rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, with some 30 people, they huddle in vans after the medical equipment on the roof and going through difficult terrain to the villages that need the most help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The luck does not always follow them.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They have repeatedly had to push vehicles through rivers or muddy tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they are received as a hero: The community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available housing.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle-with his big smile and boundless energy - is more than happy to join in the festivities.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team starts to receive hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We get 500 people at each visit,&quot; Mr. Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They can live to 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In this mobile hospital, various health care is provided.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and pests.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others may receive crutches, collected a pair of glasses or a birth certificate free-document needed to attend school, but many poor families simply can't afford to buy it.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening, the team practice of simple surgery under local anaesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations are usually performed in a school, a town hall or a house; after the surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave room for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating theatre and the sterilization of equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It's a grueling pace, but the Musicians Village to help the team to stay motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They beat on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work,&quot; explained Mr Bwelle..</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the team will return to the city, tired but proud of the work she has done.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has practiced 700 surgical procedures for free over the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference to those who are helped.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man explained that the free operation he underwent to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;It will change my future and that of my family,&quot; said the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to this mobile hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="51">This is the second job, he explains, which funds 60% its association; the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I don't know when he sleeps,&quot; said Katie O'malley, a medical student in the second year of the Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer group of Dr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association to conduct these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'malley, who came from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in its missions, it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they were not at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;One was able to participate in operations to help stanch the blood or get Dr. Bwelle instruments,&quot; explained Ms. o'malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">It is not something that you have the opportunity to do in America when you're a medical student in the second year.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Student volunteers typically pay their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, their transport and education are being cared for by Dr. Bwelle..</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is a hero, there is no doubt,&quot; said Katie o'malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not about to be extinguished.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Dr. Bwelle, the workload of relatively constant is not a problem.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Helping others to live happily with the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I'm so happy when I do this work,&quot; added Mr Bwelle..</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I'm doing.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons that lead me to do that.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Visit ascovime to see how to help.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Perplexed, academics have long struggled to identify and locate Pierre Nora.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Professor in the lecture halls and classrooms?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Without a doubt, but by emphasizing its low for the Traverse, Sciences-po, Hautes Etudes.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Arbitrator of the works of others in her office on the street gaston-gallimard?</seg>
		<seg id="5">In fact, but ignoring the work hidden underground and writing from the publisher.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Heir to the armchair Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Certainly, but knowing that such a rite cannot replace the real holy oil, the thesis, that it happened.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They readily acknowledged him as a major champion, host and for their work, but pointed out that he was reluctant to produce it himself.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Has this image uncertain the monument &quot;sites of memory,&quot; to which he attached his name, also contributed.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The nasty languages were able to see a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator with a keen glance and weighted with scholarship, but hopelessly dilettante.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The two books published by Nora here almost two years ago have already established that anyone who was not writing were many and well written.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The book here should make him permanently.</seg>
		<seg id="13">There are, however, once more, the temptation of ubiquity, casual/promiscuous intellectual, the jubilation last jump as feet from one subject to another.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But it soon becomes apparent that the disparate objects collected in this book so as to reduce the junk at one and the same passion: Discover the constitutive node of the French identity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Why these dramatic appeals to national unity?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Identity: It is a concern.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Recently, we have collectively been invited to give a definition.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But in the minds of our leaders, the French identity was a timeless essence.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It was only in the accidents, and the matter requires Jacobinism, was entrusted to the Prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.</seg>
		<seg id="20">That stalking Pierre Nora is quite another.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is not an heir to an eternal Francité, he refuses to the definition.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Analyst worried a familiar strangeness, wandering in a forest of symbols, at each step by an object in the shape of Rory Rébus, irritating questions.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Including this one, which comes from the company itself: why, in a country so permanently installed at its borders, if formerly big-boned and bridge-of-castle firmly, what these dramatic calls to unit?</seg>
		<seg id="24">They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to avert the disorder born discord of French history.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Frank and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundian, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="26">And the most famous, of course, is the one that splits into two national history.</seg>
		<seg id="27">After the earthquake, the French Revolution two stories and they have two nations, one Catholic, the other revolutionary.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The second was the death of the first, but without reaching the deny; on the contrary, in the sacredness and all the more eager of unity and indivisibility that she had cut off the head of anyone who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.</seg>
		<seg id="29">And, from there, a nation solidly binary, split between left and right, secular and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the Revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To feel this singularity of French identity, nothing beats the four not out of L'hexagone, so the American getaway of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Because America and France have one and the other is a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to start a new company.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But the American parentage is only better highlight what is unique to us.</seg>
		<seg id="33">There, men who had left their former regime in England and had more to worry about.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Here, men crowded an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more dramatic.</seg>
		<seg id="35">A consensual revolution when here it has sown the drama and conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The founding fathers always honoured, and here the revolutionary ancestors who were struggling to make models, and the rest fought.</seg>
		<seg id="37">An institutional constancy, and by a cascade of constitutions, as mistakes catch up and trials to resume.</seg>
		<seg id="38">France, which is at stake, France which has just</seg>
		<seg id="39">But there was a time when the French thought able to reattach the torn dress in their history and overcome the curse of both.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The Third Republic, Central Time and creator, Pierre Nora has shown great interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who are employed to repair the revolutionary divide, by teaching schoolchildren all that in old France preparing obscurely modern France and offering them a unified version of their story.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But this peaceful identity had only one time.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Here she is again in the debate, pushed by a new immigration, threatened by the rise of industrial minorities, absorbed in the European space.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France is at stake and the careful outline of France.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.</seg>
		<seg id="45">It discovered that it was a homelover chemineau.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The man many curiosities, slightly obsessive revolved around a single idea.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The Prowler edges stood at the center of the center.</seg>
		<seg id="48">And that, more than half a century, a story about the idea of a nation, but had evaded the Initiatic exercise of the thesis, gives us, cum grano salis, that it will eventually make it.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Certainly in a form less stiff, more fragmented and more subtle.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But make no mistake, just as binding.</seg>
		<seg id="51">Because far more than is required of the university curriculum, this Thèse-ci told the inner need of a life.</seg>

		<seg id="0">How biometrics will invade our lives</seg>
		<seg id="1">Eventually the passwords to enter to access his smartphone or make purchases?</seg>
		<seg id="2">U.S. researchers, French or Japanese, we predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors, telephones and computers.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Bernard Didier, deputy director general of Morpho, believes that &quot;the biometric century will be.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Only the biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a Universe Transverse and transnational as well as the Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but troubled.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Anything that in 2011 and in France, the National Commission on Information Technology and Freedoms allowed 774 fingerprint recognition systems, hand or venous network of hand in business, government, canteens...</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Everyone can soon be identified, anywhere and anytime,&quot; is saddened by Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, among others?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Biometrics will rely on new technologies, which will enable new services to citizens and consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Today, in France, the biometric data are most often used fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the venous system of the palm or finger.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But each of these techniques has its constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;For example, some people who work on concrete fingers very damaged and their fingerprints are unreadable,&quot; Philippe Robin, technical director of Thales Communications Identity &amp; Security.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And the collection and verification of the venous network and the outline of the hand involves a voluntary gesture and precise.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback: the procedure must be repeated and sometimes it takes time.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Therefore, research is conducted over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Thanks to the increase of the accuracy of the sensors and computing capability of computers to analyse data, these techniques become operational.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of the R&amp;D labs of Accenture in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have made automatic border using facial recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It is now possible to identify a face or iris.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or the manner of walking with the help of sound sensors, but it is a silent environment,&quot; says Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Single marker and tamper-free, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;In the current state of knowledge, it can be seen as the ultimate biometric data,&quot; confirms Sophie vulliet-tavernier, director of education, innovation and foresight to the CNIL.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.</seg>
		<seg id="24">NEC offers the services of the judicial police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples from the crime scene and in an hour.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The use of biometrics are divided into two groups: the identification (to recognize a person among others) and e-authentication (to ensure that the person is who he or she purports to be).</seg>
		<seg id="26">The identification was so far the issuance of identity: we must confront the biometrics (fingerprints, iris) with the information the state has on all citizens already on file.</seg>
		<seg id="27">This ensures that a person is not trying to steal someone else's identity.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This principle of comparison can have other applications.</seg>
		<seg id="29">NEC offers recognition of VIPS at the entrance of a hotel or a store.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;We get the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them with photos of celebrities who move freely over the Internet,&quot; explains Dany Nassif, NEC, France, Business Development for biometric identification solutions.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Another use: Take a photo of a down-and-out who lined up in a store, follow his progress through facial recognition and calculate the wait times.</seg>
		<seg id="32">E-authentication initially involved physical access (borders, secure facilities, canteens...) or logiques (opening of a computer).</seg>
		<seg id="33">There is added, more recently, the control of presence.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;A biometric staffand avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend that points to another,&quot; justifies Cyrille Bataller, Accenture.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But, increasingly, authentication will also involve transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money to certain distributors by introducing his card and hand over a biometric reader: it replaces the knock of the secret code.</seg>
		<seg id="37">A similar technique is tested in villeneuve- d'ascq and D'angoulême by natural security company in partnership with banks and signs of mass distribution: When to pay at the store with her credit card, the customer doesn't pare its code, but introduces his finger in a reader that scans the veins.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The trial is scheduled to last for six months.</seg>
		<seg id="39">If it is successful, the biometric readers could soon reach the French traders.</seg>
		<seg id="40">To reassure users</seg>
		<seg id="41">There are three ways to make biometrics attractive in the eyes of the general public.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The first is to explain that she can save time.</seg>
		<seg id="43">&quot;If, through biometrics, a client remains in UNJSPF thirty seconds of less, it is significant,&quot; explains the director of a large surface.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will recognize your voice and you propose options.</seg>
		<seg id="45">And, finally, reassured by the precautions taken to protect databases.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;The fingerprints are stored on a server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which is trying to block the move,&quot; lists Philippe Robin, Thales.</seg>
		<seg id="47">But, in the absence of comprehensive studies, it is impossible to know whether the speech really convince users.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The specialists of the protection of privacy, they are still worried.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;The progress of the facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of available photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, makes me fear the worst: a blanket surveillance&quot;, predicts Andrew Patrick, the Office of Privacy Protection in Canada.</seg>

		<seg id="13">For example, a passenger waiting for a gate frontier could carry a bag for free, while the person next in the queue would have to pay $100 for a similar bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O' Malley explained that the site and the procedures for the registration of frontier are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these charges before arriving at the door.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The hand luggage of frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often grumble about baggage fees and other costs, but the airlines love them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They believe that the costs of baggage handling are important and that passengers who want this service should pay.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many people on Wall Street believe the addition of baggage fees as a sign that proves that the airlines have to pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But many of them do not have hit the baggage fees.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost carrier Allegiant has followed a little later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other company imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the costs extra.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He estimated in a report in December 2011, the hand luggage of Spirit were $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines, recently travelled on spirit and wondered what he would find at the gate when the passengers will discover the unusual hand baggage fees charged by the company.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;I had never seen a boarding procedure as fluid in my entire career,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he added, &quot;the passengers boarded at lightning speed.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also like Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier said that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can carry the cannot open with them, and those who take coffee can be recycled for free.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It will distribute free water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained, and when no other major airline had followed.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The frontier's decision to charge for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is his latest effort to encourage customers to move on its website.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airlines are paying to the online travel sellers such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">This prompted airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than go to an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">However, Frontier has gone further in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, it began to offer only half of frequent flyer miles to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday, it reduced the bonus miles by 25% on a trip.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Thus, a frontier of travel 1,000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket on the frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier has a loyal clientele in its home city, Denver, but its activity is declining and it is losing money.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Revenues fell by 9% and flight capacity declined by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic attempted to adjust the frontier's finances by selling the airline.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the tail of a dog are linked to his mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Previous studies had found that the dogs happy shuffled their tails more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs the shuffled over to the left.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to it.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;Everyone knows that, in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here, we tried to see what it was in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that as well as humans, dogs on the right side of the brain was in charge of the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in the emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For more information on how the dogs react to the movement of a disorderly queue of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies containing other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured heart rate and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="8">We must certainly not long before we understand why their tails sometimes goes on the one hand, and sometimes from the other.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara explained: &quot;We presented to dogs films containing other dogs - a naturalistic version is a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factors - and we were able to fix the movement of the tail, and present it as going to the left or to the right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals were given a dog without a tail is wagging the expression to the right (from the point of view of the dog that wags her tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they spotted a tail mainly deflected to the left (again from the point of view of the dog that wags her tail), their heart rate has accelerated, and they looked anxious.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate them thanks to these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, he believes the dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He added: &quot;If you meet several times with other dogs, and if you notice, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you're depending on this experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers suggest that the results could lead to owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of both the left and the right in the canine species.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that the dogs turned his head to the left when they were watching an aggressive dog and right when he was a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another scientific study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;The dogs were more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is contained in the Italian study.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said that the differences could be that the dogs involved in the various studies did not consider fully the animals of the films or the robot dogs as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study on how the dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;While many elements, among different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered, it will surely not long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on the one hand and sometimes on the other.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were chasing the rebels of M 23 into their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The 23 appears to be beaten after being chased from villages in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that he controlled from the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;We will continue the M 23 and drive it wherever it is hiding because they are criminals,&quot; said Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman of the FARDC.</seg>
		<seg id="4">We must not allow them to reorganize themselves because they ball the Congolese people for too long.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The time has come to bring peace.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Officials of the M 23 explained to have evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand bissimwa, political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks commits to its claims to the peace talks.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of insurgents to be dropped this week, and in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At their peak in November, the insurgents have occupied Goma, capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the garrison and the passivity of the MONUSCO peacekeepers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The fall of Goma has led the UN mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staffing, to strengthen its mandate and to create a rapid intervention brigade made up of South African, Tanzanian and Malawian soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For its part, the staff of the FARDC has been redesigned and the military has gone on the offensive against the M23, change the course of the war.</seg>

		<seg id="13">&quot;The 23 million seems to be coming to an end,&quot; predicts one expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, a Congo Siasa blog.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It would be history-it would be the first time that the Kinshasa Government manages to beat a major insurgency.</seg>
		<seg id="15">And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in the eastern DRC.</seg>
		<seg id="16">UN experts accuse Rwanda, who vehemently denies supporting militarily the M 23, initially set up by former Congolese military mutineers.</seg>

		<seg id="0">John Kerry conceded, is unprecedented, that an American espionage &quot;had gone too far in an inappropriate manner.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">John Kerry has indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States about its surveillance programs in unprecedented admission that on several occasions, the spying &quot;had gone too far in an inappropriate manner.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The secretary of state also admitted that he had, as Barack Obama, ruled on &quot;automatic pilot&quot; when a series of incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden on the NSA's spying activities.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr Kerry said: &quot;It is undeniable that the president, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things on automatic pilot because we had the opportunity, since the Second World War and to the difficult years of the cold war, then of course the September 11.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">He then became the first high-ranking member of the Government of the United States to admit that the American spy had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;In some cases, it has gone too far.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">And the president is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he was now a thorough re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels wrong.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I assure you that innocent people will not be abused, in the framework of this process.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: &quot;We live in a new world where people are ready to blow.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is a radical extremism around the world, which is determined to try to kill people, causing them to explode and addressed by Governments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We have prevented aircraft from falling, blowing up buildings and people being killed, because we have been aware of the facts in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight against terrorism with the United States, said on Thursday the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they had made on a possible withdrawal of anti-terror organizations because of frustration about the oversight of the National Security Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that the Europeans are still in our mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism,&quot; said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and President of the European affairs subcommittee of the U.S. Senate, in an interview from Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">And I am going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some U.S. allies, however, the agency's director said this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that Nato allies had collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other heads of state.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying on allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice of the two sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said that her Office was organizing a tour of the congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The names of other legislators meeting is expected to be unveiled in the coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He said that the route remained to be defined.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Murphy said the aim of the trip was to improve relations, but also to show &quot;tough love.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">He explained that the European heads of state were to be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs that they applied themselves for years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;We can change our surveillance programs in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not alone in the world of espionage,&quot; Murphy said.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel this weekend to the middle east and Poland to manage the resentment caused by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by the U.S. surveillance activities.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After having thrown in the towel with a vengeance in January for a partial resumption of Goodyear amiens-nord, promised the closure, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American tyre titan, expresses today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 137 in the plant.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Jean-luc Mélenchon, minister of productive recovery, had already announced on Monday 21 October.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Having dropped the plan to purchase the plant in January, you will return today.</seg>
		<seg id="4">You spoke of violent attacks and insults, speaking of &quot;so-called workers,&quot; who &quot;work three hours&quot; a day, unions &quot;crazy,&quot; with the CGT.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This U-turn is not understood.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Is it to please Mr Jospin?</seg>
		<seg id="7">I was trying to do something nice for someone.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Except for my wife.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr Jospin, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs are among the best paid.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If I hurt anyone by my words, I am sorry.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But France has a high level of tax and unemployment too.</seg>

		<seg id="14">In India, China and other countries, is ten to twelve hours a day.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But I don't have any prejudices about France.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tires, good facilities, is well located and has space to expand.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Why titan he needs so much of this plant?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Titan does not need to buy the plant.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But, with the right price and skilled workers, it is worth a try.</seg>
		<seg id="20">What kind of agreement you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?</seg>
		<seg id="21">If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think that 100% of employees have accepted.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Now, imagine that Titan Buys Goodyear plant closed.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other country of the European Union, which still has its own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I think that Mr Jospin knows that.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, it wants to keep the plant in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid jobs.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Titan accepts to recruit among the approximately 1,200 employees of Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Mr. Jospin also he needs a commitment of titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A new request for class-action suit was filed against the brothers St. Croix, on sexual assault, which allegedly took place, this time at Saint Joseph's Oratory, as well as several orphanages, schools and colleges.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The request is based on the testimony of the Complainant, identified as &quot;J&quot;, who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first notre-dame-des-neiges by his teacher brother, then by his confessor Father Bernard, St. Joseph's Oratory, where he was an altar boy and where his father worked as a painter.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The first appeal was only three, and when we announced the settlement, many people told us: &quot;I was, can I register?,&quot; said lawyer Alain Arsenault, who represents the victims in the two appeals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The class action, which has been tabled is notable for the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of St. Croix.</seg>
		<seg id="5">At present, the appeal brings complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers Croix.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the targeted schools closed their doors in the 1960s.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The appeal also stressed that the congregation of St. Croix and St. Joseph's Oratory, which is a separate entity, &quot;allowed sexual abuse are perpetrated against children,&quot; that they &quot;have a moral, religious and psychological pressure on the victims,&quot; they &quot;were aware of sexual abuse and the hushed, however,&quot; and that they &quot;knowingly and deliberately chose to ignore the problem.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">These latest accusations are based on letters written by the brothers' lawyer, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by research in the archives on the subject by the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former St. Croix's brother who publicly denounced the abuse.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments on the request for suspension.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The appeals court said the judge should be relieved of the case because it has breached the code of conduct for judges by undermining the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews to the media and public statements in which she publicly reacted to criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men under their control and search program.</seg>

		<seg id="6">Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by American service providers of storage in the cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have attracted more than ever the paranoia of companies to state oversight.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;indeterminate sex.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for infants born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The male or female of new born no longer awarded, so rigid, at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to disclose the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on his birth certificate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The aim of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could take hasty decisions concerning a sex-change surgery for their babies, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the BBC, a person intersexed have said years later, &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain the patchwork that created the doctors, bruised and Scarface.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year, nor is it a boy or a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are LGBTI, inter-sex forming part of the Group of the sixty diseases diagnosed disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with chromosome or gonads (ovaries or testes) atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed..</seg>
		<seg id="10">The sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information for the award, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical procedure, if any.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and expert on sexual identification, said that the new German law &quot;seems to be a good idea.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">The intersex children posed an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people are suffering from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical procedure, but it is not the case for most children,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is possible to make a sexual assignment without the operation, and see how the identity develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Science, which is how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nobody can answer the question of why this happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It's like the mystery that surrounds the homosexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but rather to their constitution, which is not only that of a man or a woman exclusively, but in general the two at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), the primary sexual traits (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by transgender and intersex people in employment, and the extent of the acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Young boys gender non-conforming now camps specially for them.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; on their official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie may-welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as &quot;neutral&quot; after winning his appeal, which allows him to keep an &quot;unspecified&quot; for life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The German passports will contain a third appointment next to M or F-x for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report broadcast on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of legislators in this deeply Catholic country have signed a petition for the &quot;gender theory&quot; be removed from school books.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The American site Catholic Online also objected to German law, writing that &quot;since the world is dragged into a new situation, where the genre is a choice, but where sexual activity is not reversed, the other two pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">In Maryland, the mother of an infant on baby zone has also said that it would prefer that one sex is given to babies at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Parenting is stressful enough without the additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,&quot; she said on the website for young parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born without male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, named after the Greek god who had a double.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And there is barely a decade, the medical community believed the genre as a slate, we can erase and redraw it.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now, many of those who question the ethical basis of the surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel its sexual reassignment when he grows up.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,&quot; Drescher said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When these children were born, we did not call the psychiatrist, one caller to the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was initiated by Dr. John Money, of the Johns Hopkins University, who believes that the genre is malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that the social and environmental signals-how parents raising a child-interact with genes and hormones of a child for the shape in order to be identified as male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in a case of 1966, known as &quot;John Joan,&quot; his theories have given rise to controversy.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised parents to a small boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to castrate entirely, by removing the testicles, and raised as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Money has presented it as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case,&quot; Drescher said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">At the age of about 15 years, he has re-emerged as a boy and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But at 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher said that some doctors &quot;always repeat this model.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say &quot; [ that ] they are not satisfied with the outcome.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors could not say if he had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never have a &quot;satisfactory&quot; life as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So shortly after its birth in 1976, Bruce has undergone surgical removal of the external body and testicles and was raised as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He was taking female hormones at the age of 12.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I was not a girl,&quot; he told abcnews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At 18, he underwent a vaginoplastie..</seg>
		<seg id="52">But depressed and realizing that something wasn't right, he asked his medical record.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he found was horrified.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at birth - and no one had ever told me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for her sexual organs can develop.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After learning the truth, he became a man with a testosterone treatment and had her breasts removed.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The surgery made him sterile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which seeks to standardize the collection of intersex people.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne tamar-mattis, executive director of the nonprofit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law &quot;invites labeling and stigma.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are worried that the German law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their child an&quot; indeterminate &quot;sex,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that it encourages the interventions.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We believe that it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-mattis said his organization supported the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre,&quot; she added.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law regarding the attribution of sex at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This is not a battle that young children should undertake at that age.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and to help thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law &quot;empower&quot; parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a capacity/dds called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but no womb or ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now aged 29, Katie is married and in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Although it is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law allows some latitude for parents so they do not have to make hasty decisions,&quot; Baratz said.</seg>
		<seg id="76">This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time before &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="77">Thus, all goes well - you can raise your child and the like.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.</seg>
		<seg id="79">You don't have to rush for a surgical procedure that is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;It puts the child at the heart of the decision and reduces the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what it takes,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Finally, the child will decide what gender he or she feels the most comfortable - and it is something fantastic.</seg>
		<seg id="82">This allows the child to make the decision for himself.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The cry of despair of a voter for Obama</seg>
		<seg id="1">I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change</seg>
		<seg id="2">He said that Obama has made commendable efforts were thwarted by the Republican Party's obstructionism</seg>
		<seg id="3">Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of Obamacare, nor the drone attacks</seg>
		<seg id="4">The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the 2nd year of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the gloom of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; and memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I finished the medical records of patients in the evening and go to sleep, this book Remmène me when the policies inspired millions of people and where the speech could leave you breathless.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election ended in a landslide victory and the presenters of The News newspapers took the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My comrades wept with joy and my parents have retained all the newspapers they found.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young visionary team moves into the White House and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During the transition period of Obama before taking office in 2008, he had 82% of favourable opinions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I shut the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Returning to the present is a difficult, it's like waking from a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember these days full of optimism, such as distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I put the credit of Obama's major achievements since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) until the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of the &quot;neither seen nor experienced&quot; and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In addition, I think the partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after repeatedly defended the Obama administration against my peers and my colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I am on the verge of despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders, nor the child attacks innocent foreigners by drones.</seg>
		<seg id="24">She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' privacy, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who disclose government wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It cannot justify the killing of anwar al-awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the escape of public finance and exceeding authorized expenditures during presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that said that the White House's efforts to silence the media are the &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And, more recently, it does not excuse the failure to develop a single website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know if this is what I expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that leadership could contradict the previous political campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that occur by chance, like the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However, all of the examples that I listed above seem to largely be the choice of the administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">That is what bothers me the most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I have voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney had a confused alternative and refined that seemed not to determine its policies or its positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we heard for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Yet, while the index of favourable opinions plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to the year 2008 through this book.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me wish the numerous promises that have soared.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At a meeting of advertisements, he told his team that they can get back on track and remain true to their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want us to focus on our talent,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We have to remember who we are.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Here we are five years later, Mr. President, and I don't agree with you more.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders on its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources close to the case, which shows once again that the global regulators over suspicions of market manipulation of currency starts to bear fruit.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Some of the world's biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the investigation of the largest financial market in the world, where 5.3 trillion US dollars change hands each day.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation, which echoes the scandal of manipulation of the Libor interbank rate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month have received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;The ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators,&quot; said a representative of the bank two weeks ago.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Last month, sources close to the case said that RBS had sent files of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former trader, the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and had been suspended from his position as European head of spot currency trading at jpmorgan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Rohan Ramchandani, head of foreign exchange spot trading at Citi, was placed on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
		<seg id="9">None of these traders have no charges.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr. Usher's record included instant messages sent to and from bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the case said.</seg>
		<seg id="11">UBS said this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Worldwide, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority-examine the allegations made on bankers who allegedly conspired to manipulate exchange rates.</seg>
		<seg id="13">HSBC, Citigroup, jpmorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, said sources close to the case.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Banks picked instant messages and emails for years to find cases of wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The news about these investigations shook traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of the trading units from investment banks in recent years, but that was challenged this year due to the weak currency volatility which limits the opportunities for speculators.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Some bankers have tried to play down the issue by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the currency market highly liquid, but the traders seniors explained that this is not necessarily true.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms &quot;explains that it is possible to start to have an impact on the market at a low cost.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader working in his office of the London stock exchange traded funds this week after he caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A Chinese newspaper, which launched an appeal on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be overhauled, said a regulator of the press.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The New Express newspaper based in Guangzhou, issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories of a semi-public company.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Now, the new Express will undergo a complete overhaul, &quot;said the Governor.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The &quot;realignment&quot; comes from the administration of Guangdon for press and publishing, radio, film and television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several articles on incorrect listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;The drafting of new express was disorganized,&quot; said the regulator in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He said that he had decided to &quot;impose an administrative sanction to Chen Yongzhou in him withdrawing his press card.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">He also &quot;ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conducts an investigation to the responsible persons at New Express and re-plans immediately the newspaper's management team.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr Chen wrote several articles for The New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.</seg>
		<seg id="11">After his arrest, his newspaper published twice a first appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television station, where he admitted to have published false stories for money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;In this case, I hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public,&quot; he told the public television network CCTV.</seg>
		<seg id="14">I did so mainly because I was running after money and fame.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I realized my mistake.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Following the apology from Mr. Chen, New Express published an apology on its front page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; by the Coen brothers, Grand Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich Village in 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Joel and Ethan Coen, whose film has been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque Française, had won the Palme d'or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Failing to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their vested on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In this film, full of humor, where the music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac is a folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop to folk music with a contagious jubilation.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich trappings of Daisy Mulligan in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; for less glamorous clothes, a soft-spoken when she sings, but the expletive charged rampage when she speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; tells about a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and get angry with the whole earth.</seg>
		<seg id="7">He reluctantly accepts the replacements on the hoof in the studios.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Homeless, he toured sofas of friends who still want to receive it.</seg>
		<seg id="9">An air of documentary</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;His relationship with success is tortured, this is what we wanted: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, which is not a careerist, but integrates with a self-destructive behaviour,&quot; said to the press, Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel several Oscars and prizes at Cannes.</seg>
		<seg id="11">If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers folk music fans have built their story on real personalities of the time like the folk musician Dave von Ronk.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The idea was to show the time before the advent of Greenwich Village, New York headquarters to become &quot;the epicenter of the folk music boom that would lead to international stars,&quot; writes journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The film then resemble a documentary, dusty music label invaded by 33 T sale-or-return inhabited by an old secretary hilarious, the musical choices of the studios of the era and the cafes of the singers.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The magic of the Coen Brothers operates by integrating a funny character who runs the film at all times: a magnificent red cat under craquant, companion of fortune as Llewyn Davis.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Asked about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having &quot;grew up in Tennessee, bathed by the blues and country.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For Justin Timberlake, if the work is required to be considered as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;Chance can also launch the career of someone,&quot; and &quot;more and more today.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">As Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on his music, pop star explains that in a career, &quot;the most important thing is to not get caught in anything that can prevent us from Express.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">The United States are sometimes went &quot;too far&quot; in terms of espionage, has recognized the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession from Washington in the dispute with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).</seg>
		<seg id="2">After ten days of Scandal, Revelations and denials from the United States and its European allies, it is the first time that an official U.S. Government explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;In some cases, I grant you, as president, some of these actions have gone too far, and we will ensure that it does not happen again in the future,&quot; said John Kerry, at a conference in London that he was from Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In his televised speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has largely justified the practice of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention against possible attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Citing the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had foiled several planned attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and information gathering.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We have in fact prevented planes from falling, as buildings exploded and people were murdered, because we were in a position to be aware of these projects,&quot; argued the boss of American diplomacy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And, said John Kerry for the Europeans, &quot;I assure you that in this process of innocent people were not misled.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">But we are trying to gather information.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;And yes, in some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate manner,&quot; admitted the secretary of state, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He assured on Thursday evening that President Obama was &quot;committed to try to clarify and that it was reviewing these practices so that nobody feels deceived.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The newspaper, citing documents obtained from the NSA revelations of Edward Snowden, says the program called &quot;muscular&quot; and conducted with the NSA's British counterpart, GCHQ, allows the two agencies to collect data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.</seg>
		<seg id="14">According one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the month of January-ranging from metadata on emails, text or audio or video.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These interceptions would be held outside the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy, revealed that the NSA had intercepted massive amounts of data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
		<seg id="18">To the anger of European states and the leaks in the US press said that the American president was not aware of such eavesdropping, Barack Obama declined to speak on the matter, citing national security.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However, the powerful boss of the NSA, Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, has denied that its intelligence agency has collected tens of millions of European citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He even returned the ball to the European intelligence services that would have to take these communications, before providing them to the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This would include &quot;military operations&quot; in countries where Nato allies are cooperating with the United States, and it would certainly not Europe, said General Alexander.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And the controversy was extended on Friday in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the US as part of a vast international spy network, which has also attracted the ire of China.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: vieillir earlier</seg>
		<seg id="1">Studies show that young african-american and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">The experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A mother should worry if the breasts and pubic hair of her daughter start to grow 7 or 8 years old?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which took place this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, Pédo-endocrinologue, explained that these physical changes are fairly common among young American and represent a new standard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,&quot; Kaplowitz said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The visible signs of development, such as budding breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there was only a small step from the age of first menstruation in the past four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, when he was 12 years old three quarters in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Once the chest started to grow, it is at least two or three years before the first appear,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also the author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The essential guide to coping with this common problem.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">The time is the more accurate test to find out how to go through puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is a debate about what constitutes the real onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;early&quot; when breast development is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, development slows or stops-it is something that a pediatrician can follow closely.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A more rapid evolution can justify tests conducted by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors and cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are treatments to delay the onset of first menstruation and prevent other consequences: a premature aging of the bones, which can dampen growth and a small adult size.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations on hormone therapy and are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs, but acknowledged that &quot;the control of puberty can mitigate some behavioural problems and feel for young girls to be different from others.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other big problem is understandable: the parents simply do not want their very young girls have their rules.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage health issues,&quot; Kaplowitz said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter had her first menstruation.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, she wasn't prepared emotionally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She returned from the school frightened and upset of being the first among his friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many theories to the public on the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Still, there is no coherent theory that the hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or the sexual messages conveyed by the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The boys, as girls reach puberty earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz says that the most credible theory is that of the obesity epidemic.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years old that binds the percentage of body fat at the onset of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, young african-american and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">At the global level, the mechanisms of precocious puberty appear to be influenced by everything from the weather, economic conditions through the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another problem: that boys have hair on the face and in the pubic area, the trend towards early puberty Real is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors attending the conference of the PAA emphasized the complexity of the subject.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We must be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a Pédo-endocrinologue working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their paediatrician on how to talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;It can mean having a conversation sooner than expected,&quot; Kaplowitz said.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you stay calm, your child will respond well in general.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls with early puberty should be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 to the creation of the Association for the Defence of the hostages &quot;hostages of the World,&quot; which he presides over several years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">His main goal: Get the opportunity for the hostages and their kidnappers in front of the International Criminal Court.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Detained more than 1,000 days, the four hostages from AQIM (Al-qaeda In The Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">After medical examinations at the Val-de-grâce Military Hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they had been reunited with their families.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And try, little by little, to resume their lives.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Le Nouvel Observateur,&quot; asked Jean-louis Normandin, 62, former grand reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association &quot;hostages of the world.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">From the evening of your release, you were on the set of the &quot;Antenne 2 P.M..&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">What are your memories of your release?</seg>
		<seg id="10">In particular, in Beirut.</seg>
		<seg id="11">When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car, where I meet-without seeing it because he is black-Roger Auque.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He told me that &quot;one is released,&quot; but I'm not sure, and think that we can still be killed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">One is very excited, but also very tense.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is war, and those who lead us are also very tight.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They settle on the edge of a sidewalk.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are Syrian military.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Then we arrive at the Hotel Summerland, where the press is present.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The French lead us to the French embassy.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It is the time of the first phone calls to the parents, family, friends, to the press...</seg>
		<seg id="20">I remember taking a bath for one hour.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And to have dinner in a T-shirt at the French Embassy.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I also remember a short night to talk with Roger and Marchiani.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The tension is still there, because we don't have the resources to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Arriving there by helicopter, taking a private plane back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua features.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How did you arrive on French soil?</seg>
		<seg id="26">It lands at Orly.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It's a little brutal.</seg>
		<seg id="29">There is an incredible scramble.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And much of the media.</seg>
		<seg id="31">When I left there were three television channels.</seg>
		<seg id="32">I go back and there are full.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Descending the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, this is all very emotional.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Between the airport and home, many motorcycles follow our car Roussin leads.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The bikers, craving for photos and follow me to my home, where I have to do a little the police to prevent some up.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The media pressure is enormous.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It does not stop, we are well placed to know...</seg>
		<seg id="38">But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is hard to comprehend.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Out of a hole and it is suddenly under the media spotlight.</seg>
		<seg id="40">It's a little complicated, a little violent, too complex to manage.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But it was the hardest.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On the day, I am to 8:00 p.m. the next day as I am on TV.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Then began a rehabilitation of sorts to the life, very gently, for a month or two that are a little like vacations.</seg>
		<seg id="44">How to have passed the medical examinations and debriefing DGSE?</seg>
		<seg id="45">I had the right to an initial medical examination in Corsica.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The rest was taken to the Val-de-grâce The following days my back: radios, all kinds of tests and meeting with a psychiatrist.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It is not a meeting that does everything, but we know we can count on him, remember if necessary, that it is not left to ourselves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">It is part of the procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="49">I also met the intelligence services.</seg>
		<seg id="50">They asked me questions about the hostage-takers.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It was logical.</seg>
		<seg id="52">I was not embarrassed.</seg>
		<seg id="53">Today, how do you react to the release of four hostages of Niger?</seg>
		<seg id="54">I listen to what is said.</seg>
		<seg id="55">The debate on the ransom.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Few things annoy me, others less so.</seg>
		<seg id="57">I try to separate the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as chairman of the association &quot;hostages of the world&quot; that allows me to put in the distance, and seems to me much more interesting to talk about.</seg>
		<seg id="58">I wonder, for example, on the definition of resilience.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.</seg>
		<seg id="60">I think there is a problem of semantics.</seg>
		<seg id="61">He described the hostage taking of hostages &quot;politics&quot; - which is most often the case - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to complain and get their hostage takers in front of the International Criminal Court.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But who said that the hostages might also have access to justice?</seg>
		<seg id="64">A court in The Hague is for it.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Why do we not say to hostage-takers &quot;you have violated the rules of war, such as those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="66">It seems to me, however, legitimate, hit in the right direction.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This message is heard but not listened to, and that makes me angry.</seg>
		<seg id="68">That is my primary battle.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: the break-up of Europe gives the choice for Scots</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another disturbing history of independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
		<seg id="4">While it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde said the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it wasn't even in the headlines (and expected).</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nor has anyone said that the EU Member States spend much of their time to circumvent their formal rules when it suits them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a persistent disregard of the rules would be a concession that Brussels could offer in exchange for what it wants to achieve from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a story that is not one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And a story so old that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the canard that &quot;independence means the passport control&quot; more than 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nevertheless, we forgot something interesting in this interpretation of a dusty old tale.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why an independent Scotland should follow the instructions of Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why share the yoke of London against Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here's the real news about Europe: the great postwar plan to unify Europe is definitely dead.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Across Europe, parties which oppose the ÅU or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and came out of nowhere, brought together almost five million votes in federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent of our liberal Democrats) of the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There has always been a national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled to the straitjacket on national economies through membership in the single currency, has led many people to think that Europe has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits - this was only true for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The European system is rather poses to its Members of favourable exchange rates to German exporters - that German politicians want to keep.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe is faced with a problem of intrinsic productivity to Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only recourse is to make drastic cuts in wages and public spending-encouraged by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise in Europe linked to productivity.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Following the &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - who are one reason to subsidize the French and German companies in the energy sector at the consumer's expense-European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times more for gas than the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This is a crippling disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have seen in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All the pay freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry to be penalized by a cheap American shale gas.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result, the revolt looms, particularly in France, one of the major leaders of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite has considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin no longer needs from Paris as a passport for his political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to scramble.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result: the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, the National Front Anti-european, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party who reminded him that he cannot assume that a split of the Right will automatically left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Marine Le Pen is doing with its new popularity among the white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-monnaie and Anti-european bloc in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the anti-european parties are doing well in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="35">That is what I think: very soon, the anti-european sentiment and anti-monnaie unique in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it will be something that is more like the &quot;Europe of Nations (sovereign)&quot; Free choice of General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that the UK should take away from this project, and I hope that it will be up to the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, the growing interest from Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">And Scotland, in all this?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to be a region of England (mostly).</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending promener Berlin and Brussels.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I think Scotland could accommodate a European agreement over free on condition that we keep our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a Europe of nations rather than federal law.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should emulate Norway and retain our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP government in Scotland is - and it is - the anti-austerity political movement, which has been more successful in Europe, having won a most spectacular in 2011 based on his opposition to the deep cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Now it would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in your car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">While the planners of the road network of the United States are struggling to find the money needed to repair the highway infrastructure in disrepair, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches above the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, which record all miles flown by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial effort in Washington and in government offices, planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the main American roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The sector generally, without interest, of the main planning suddenly provoked a lively debate and alliances sea-states.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Libertarians joined environmental groups in order to exert pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep track of the miles you fly, and possibly of the road on which you drive, then use the information to prepare a draft law.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The tea party is appalled.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And while members of Congress can't agree on whether he should continue, several States did not wait.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will move to a system allowing drivers to pay according to the number of miles flown.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS tracking system, for an experimental Virée.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This is really essential for our nation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It is not as if we had a choice,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the state began recording the miles flown by each Californian motorist by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The pressure comes from the fact that the highway trust fund, financed with taxes that Americans pay at the pump is dry financially.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Americans are not buying as much gasoline as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars can travel more miles a gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has not increased over the past 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 percent, while gasoline prices are high.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gasoline tax is simply not tenable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His state has recently installed plotters on 500 cars to test a system of payment to the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;It is proving to be the most logical alternative in the long term,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Wonks call it user fees to the mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is not surprising that the idea for attracting urban liberals, since the fees could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Planners of California is interested in as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set in the ambitious legislation on global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the Representative Bill Shuster (R-PA.), chairman of the transportation committee of the House of Representatives, said that he considered as the most viable alternative in the long term.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The supporters of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of charging drivers a mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He is not just a tax spirals into a big black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People pay more for their benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move in the direction of the payment to the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The U.S. Senate approved a pilot project of $90 million last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the House killed the proposal, responding to concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or in the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several states and large cities are still in progress.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry the most important experience of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These motorists will soon pay the state Cordouan fees instead of taxes on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The City of New York is considering a..</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal success.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 motorists volunteers recently equipped their cars with a device, the drivers were worried that the government can track their movements.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;The concern about Big Brother and stuff like that are a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic management of the performance at the Nevada Department of Transportation.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It is not something that people want.</seg>
		<seg id="43">At the beginning of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to convert these devices into tracking devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is not necessary to build a huge technological infrastructure and cumbersome that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily comings and goings.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of the few states that are struggling now to find an affordable technology that would enable the state to know how many miles a vehicle travels, but without knowing the place or the exact time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If we can do it, &quot;added Khan, citizens will be more comfortable.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California start-ups in the name of true mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Originally, the company did not help motorists who pay taxes to the states.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She was looking to break into the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices they tested enjoyed the main planners because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information downloaded periodically via modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People will be more inclined to do that if you don't record their speed and don't find them,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, director general of true mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Big mistakes were made in pilot programs in some states.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are far less expensive and far less intrusive methods.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, the planners trying experience by providing motorists with various choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Other states hope to sell the concept to unsuspecting citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a system of taxation that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide an insurance payment &quot;to conduct&quot; and create a set of data on the real-time speed from the other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,&quot; said a document on urban development.</seg>
		<seg id="60">However, some transportation planners are wondering whether the whole debate on the Payment to the mile is not just a huge distraction.</seg>
		<seg id="61">The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the Bay Area of San Francisco, officials say that the Congress could just manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="62">A single or additional annual fee could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of fuel, so that everyone pays their fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;It is not necessary to resort to a radical surgery when simply need aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs from the Commission.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent ice in the world of jellyfish.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists recreate chemically brilliant protein.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the PH of the protein to make it sparkle.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Chris says that, since ice cream starts to shine when she responds to the heat of the mouth, licks, it's brilliant.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Charlie, the founder of the Society of Ice &quot;Lick Me I'm Delicious,&quot; said: &quot;It's something amazing, but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g this thing costs about £ 200.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The protein that we use in the ice reacts with the PH neutral language.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So when your mouth warms the protein, the ph level rises and the ice starts to shine.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We have tested over recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everybody at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is probably the most expensive ice that I created because the luminescent jellyfish worth four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But she is rather good taste!</seg>
		<seg id="13">The experimental approach of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But her next creation, promises to be even more ambitious.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He added: &quot;I would really like to develop an invisible ice.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is intrinsically impossible due to refraction caused by ice crystals that form the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin Étonne-t you?</seg>
		<seg id="3">This is good news, but it does not surprise me.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In the past, when the species were described and identified based on morphological, anatomical and, today, the development of new tools such as genetics will allow us to improve our knowledge of the species classification.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology is challenging the classification or membership of a species to a genre, a family, or even an order.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified the animals, based on morphological differences among species.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today, some of these rankings are challenged because of advances in genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Similarly, two very close morphologically species were identified through genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is the case of the new species, which has just been identified.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He said a decade ago, the scientific community recognized both species from this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and humpback whales in the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Recent analyses of four distinct species.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Why is this an important discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society?</seg>
		<seg id="13">From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">If this population was already long been known by the researchers, they did not know that she was part of a new species, introduced only here.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A species is considered threatened or endangered, according to the number of people existing on earth, i.e. the stock, and the ability to recover from the neighbouring stocks.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In terms of the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species is discovered, its stock is automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?</seg>
		<seg id="20">Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They live in homogenous habitats, open, where there are many genetic exchange between populations and individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The mixing of genes to limit the creation of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Conversely, the more closed ecosystems promote reproductive isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Bombardier Inc., Aerospace and Rail manufacturer, reported a fall of 15% of its net income on Thursday, under pressure from a decline in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its rail division.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bombardier, based in Montreal, did not provide any flight test data for its new Cseries aircraft nor information on whether the plane will meet its ambitious timetable for commercial service until next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the maiden flight of the test plane about a month and a half, he stole only three times, and the question was raised whether the test phase was on track.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results were not up to the expectations and stock prices fell by 8% in the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday its rating from &quot;Outperform&quot; to &quot;Sector Performance&quot; due to the potential upside of the stock market in the next quarter or the next two quarters.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;While the decline in aircraft deliveries had been largely anticipated, we are very disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,&quot; Cameron Doerksen said in a note to clients.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its cseries aircraft, as the flight test program.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, if no new order is announced in the next few months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the cseries family of aircraft will catapult in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the number of firm orders for the C-series aircraft is small so far, up from 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's assertions regarding energy efficiency and potential cost savings of the new airliner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Currently, the Company has recorded a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Pierre Beaudoin, president and chief executive, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the Commercial Service of the first plane.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday, saying that the program progressed according to schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected,&quot; Mr. Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the time out of the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Each manufacturer plans in different ways.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We had decided to proceed with a first flight and to provide an update, and it is what we have done.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It will be repeated throughout the flight programme.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow soon after, the company said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, analysts are sceptical about the fact that the first client to make stealing a cseries plane just 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said it was assessing the timing of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slow flight tests-although it appears to be consistent with internal schedule of Bombardier-reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; Mr. Doerksen said.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Adjusted Earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Revenues declined slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts were expecting a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56, according to Thomson Reuters / / s.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world said it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared with a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The net orders fell to 26 aircraft from 83.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The delay in the aeronautics division accounted for 32.9 billion as of September 30, a figure unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In aviation, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the small number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,&quot; Mr. Beaudoin said.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The aeronautics revenues decreased by 13% to reach $2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest railway builder, said that the revenue from this division had increased by nearly 11% to 2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The order book of the Transport Division totalled 32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase compared to the December 31 of the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The margins of the Transport Division suffered problems with implementation on a few large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The leaders announced that new evidence would be provided during the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The stock prices of Bombardier, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would sit on the board of directors, fell by 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Brazilian company Embraer SA, a third aircraft manufacturer in the world and Bombardier's closest rival, reported on Thursday a drop of 10% of its quarterly profit.</seg>

		<seg id="9">Under the new draft law, the media will be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &quot;canceled&quot; or no longer able to receive official press accreditation.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he did not pay his fine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to the Daily Nation, &quot;even one fine enough to paralyse most FM stations.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the &quot;lively blogosphere&quot; of Kenya.</seg>

		<seg id="1">At the beginning I denied his death, I was talking to him at present,</seg>
		<seg id="2">I was so afraid of forgetting, or rather I didn't know how I am going to keep on going.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no recipe for moving the wall of invisible and reunited with his family.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Then signs have emerged.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The first time it has been a very strong sense of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch its shows that leaves me more, raised on the night table.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is the image of my father smiled with me in my day-to-day actions.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Our mother died after his gruelling fight against cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At least that is what I thought when I found his body tensed vacuum on the hospital bed, crumpled linen.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Similarly, his funeral was a bitter farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that framed his coffin.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I thought that it was a party.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Little by little, through small diurnal and nocturnal appearances, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly turned back in my mind, as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thinking that believed in mourning.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And then, it is revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet collected, masked by my relationship with her.</seg>
		<seg id="14">So I learned and understood that I had lost any person from my mother, but simply a woman I didn't know really, a woman who embodied this person, during his stay in the life.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In dying, this woman had a perfect life and released the person I loved, and I found myself, and full.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A detour in the path of my life is the most unexpected and the most beautiful.</seg>

		<seg id="28">I was able to have a personal life.</seg>
		<seg id="29">He left me my privacy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">It lasted long and then one day he left.</seg>

		<seg id="39">On the eve of my ultrasound, where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I woke, I hissais out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the stage and I smiled and welcomed a baby boy.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep, indicating to me that he shared with joy.</seg>
		<seg id="41">And, of course, it was a small boy in my belly.</seg>
		<seg id="42">I liked to share this moment with him, and I am pleased to tell this common memory lived after his death.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died from cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A year ago, it was on a trip with my family in Cuba.</seg>
		<seg id="45">That is to say the shock of his disappearance caused the youngster that I was at the time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">In spite of everything, I realized my grief quickly enough.</seg>
		<seg id="47">But it continues to influence my life, especially in the moments when I find myself in trouble or when I have to take important decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Learn Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to be a master in a great school, were not, with hindsight, trivial choices.</seg>
		<seg id="49">In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.</seg>
		<seg id="50">The values she taught me are always present, so sometimes I think about how she would like me, whether at a given time.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The same goes for my attitude: I try to match the generosity and goodness of spirit of that which was a fervent believer.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Now, I feel like a daily presence, a benevolent soul, an uplifting spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="53">I see her eyes on me.</seg>
		<seg id="54">My mother died there nineteen years now.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Dead after speaking by telephone.</seg>
		<seg id="56">I went through all the phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, crying that activate only, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Then, time has eased the pain.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Only the lack, so empty without a response, it needs it, to assign me, reassure me at the bottom of its sweetness.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Nevertheless, it is there, silent presence, she is there and watching me.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Every morning, I see his eyes worried arise on me, I see the rings that add to her eyes, the wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes, which folds the front the concern.</seg>
		<seg id="61">My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.</seg>
		<seg id="62">And every morning, I look away.</seg>
		<seg id="63">My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at age 43.</seg>
		<seg id="64">One feels for its protection, nothing terrible can happen to us.</seg>
		<seg id="65">It was his promise to his bed of pain, then it was slowly relearned to smile and pronounce her name is no longer taboo, but a comfort.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Of course, I talk to him in the hollow of the night when the absence is too badly, it is in my dreams when morale is a little achieved.</seg>
		<seg id="67">We also feel encouraged and protected in difficult moments, the passage of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to remain on the path mapped out for us.</seg>
		<seg id="68">If you liked to be very strong, the absence can you tear the hearts and memories.</seg>
		<seg id="69">In some ways, the loved one becomes your inner energy.</seg>
		<seg id="70">I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of an asbestos-related cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="71">I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he was thinking or what he appreciated.</seg>
		<seg id="72">I could not attend his funeral, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a boy.</seg>
		<seg id="73">If I have my beliefs may be different, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his view of things.</seg>
		<seg id="74">I also had problems in my work for these beliefs.</seg>
		<seg id="75">For me, it is impossible to go in an opposite direction, I do not sleep, and I still wonder what they will think.</seg>
		<seg id="76">I do not know if I adopted it or if I'm just like him: Is it genetic?</seg>
		<seg id="77">In any case, it will always be my reference.</seg>
		<seg id="78">It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk among ourselves.</seg>
		<seg id="79">In short, he is there on a daily basis.</seg>
		<seg id="80">I feel his presence, and that makes me happy.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Here almost thirty years that my husband has died at the age of 33.</seg>
		<seg id="82">I was 28 years old and our son.</seg>
		<seg id="83">The huge penalty to me now is, of course, is muted, but it is always close to me.</seg>
		<seg id="84">Very often it &quot;landed&quot; in my dreams, so precise, so alive that alarm clock I am sad to see that it was only a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="85">The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, I say &quot;I&quot; but a voice so real that I woke up with a jolt, anxious and I turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it would happen.</seg>
		<seg id="86">I still live in the same house, and often, I feel, and I turn to see if he is not there, I know it's him and talk to him.</seg>
		<seg id="87">In all the pieces I feel his presence, and that makes me happy.</seg>
		<seg id="88">For anything in the world I cannot leave this house where we were pleased and or its spirit lives with me.</seg>
		<seg id="89">I am 58 years old, I always lived alone since his departure, it is and will remain the love of my life.</seg>
		<seg id="90">I would like to clarify that I am a sociable with responsibility, I laugh and I sang, I go out, I'm a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him, and I never spoke to him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced on Thursday the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, citing information from Radio Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This territory is 47 km, while there were three other small islands nearby.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He is British, since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, episode in the history of the British navy, which led to three Hollywood adaptations.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dozens of people, most of them descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, still inhabit Pitcairn, and their revenues depend on 95% of the generosity of London.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Island Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the tiny archipelago, 836.000 km that correspond to its exclusive economic zone.</seg>
		<seg id="7">An assistant to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate the request.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a zone would be a first step towards more fiscal autonomy for the island.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The creation of a marine reserve would allow the UK to enshrine these 836.000 km, but only if we have the means to monitor, which is not the case.</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to build one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring of the zone, and there is no port where the placement of military ships.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As for France, it must now undertake the very costly aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million sq km of the EEZ of French Polynesia, Pitcairn's neighbour.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11, stuck in a carpet standing behind the bleachers of the school's gymnasium.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes these conclusions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on foxnews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="5">They never thought that he was dead, as indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;They think that it defies logic, the laws of physics and common sense,&quot; said Crump.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They are confident that these findings were delivered only to cover the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;They sent their son to school with a binder and is paid in a mortuary bag,&quot; he added.</seg>

		<seg id="11">His death is the result of a criminal act?</seg>

		<seg id="16">Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of &quot;positional asphyxia.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, a second autopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Several questions deserve an answer or confirmation,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Moore added that he has evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Johnson, he will ask the FBI to carry it out.</seg>

		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and scored from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow for the passage of his convoy in the busy streets linking the city centre to the South suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Regarded as the &quot;spare wheel&quot; charismatic Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has expanded considerably since its victory and his speech on Friday in which he tried to portray himself as the only candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern,&quot; said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room decorated with wood when he was sworn in.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University, where he delivered his inaugural speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It was officially welcomed by a military band that played the National Anthem while he stood at attention.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi attended the ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the chant &quot;The people and the army, hand in hand...&quot; intoned by thousands of people gathered in the auditorium of the University.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Founded in 1908, and a former stronghold of the secular education, the University of Cairo later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that put an end to the authoritarian regime of Hosni Mubarak last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former president ousted, the dispossessed.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But by agreeing to formally swear an oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the will of the military by showing that the power struggle is not over.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Aircraft manufacturers are arguing over the width of the seats so that large orders are at stake</seg>
		<seg id="1">The dispute has raged between the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in Tourist Class on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow, which takes place a month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The conflict is about the width of seats on long-haul flights to passengers in economy class - which is not always the most courted by the airlines, but the space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft made by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..</seg>
		<seg id="3">This week, Airbus has called on the aviation industry to develop a standard for imposing a siege of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its big American rival Boeing said that it should be up to the airlines to decide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute erupted as manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, hoping a record of orders at the event, which will be held from November 17 to 21.</seg>
		<seg id="5">How the seats will be placed at the back of the plane - in particular, there will be 9 or 10 seats in front - is critical to the economic performance of the &quot;mini-jumbo segment.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing said that its &quot; 777&quot; refitted to accommodate Economy Class 406 people in seats more than 17 inches wide and will be configured with 10 seats per row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 will carry in economy class seat 350 people in 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The aviation giants often exchanging blows on technical issues by advertising in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777 x should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It was discovered recently in what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the financial presentation of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant, &quot;Would you?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats in the regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said John Leahy, Airbus commercial director.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As dietary habits change, people grow, but the seats on planes have not dramatically changed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the jumbo Boeing 747 has defined the modern long-haul trip, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 has increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The size of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the American health statistics.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus said that its rival is clinging to a concept that dates to the 1950s, when the circumference of the freshly device called &quot;jet set&quot; was more closely.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus says it has commissioned a study indicating that an extra inch in seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53%.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus with regard to the width of the seats and maintains that it is not the builders to decide how the airlines cut ticket prices and equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="18">He also said that the study shows that the cabin experience depends not only on the width of the seats.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It really is to provide the flexibility to airlines and allow them to do what they think they need to conduct their activities,&quot; said Kent Walld, in charge of the Boeing passenger satisfaction.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want to be told what they will be profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, it is better to have a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers is increasingly an issue that could affect their performance.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the dispute lies a race for orders for aircraft at an estimated cost of at least $700,000 to the market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of American and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what feeds the battle between the latest devices.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance by headquarters in their latest models of twin-engine long-haul 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300er of 365 seats.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The performance announced by Boeing will partly depend on the comparison between the 777 x configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of Origin set in rows of 9.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The gain in terms of unit costs is small compared to the aircraft configured with 10 seats per row.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Boeing is going to be able to squeeze more seats and make its planes more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, director of passenger comfort in the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in existing M777 suggests that many passengers were in favour of a more dense configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for the passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,&quot; said the expert in interior cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor in chief of Runway Girl network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing does not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers including airlines must choose.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Sellers of aircraft that circle the world prevail, even with a metre to verify the competing configurations.</seg>
		<seg id="33">While extolling comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with higher density configurations for low-cost airlines and regional travel.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus is offering the A350 configured with 10 seats per row, but says he has not yet sold.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus highlighted the need for greater customization of booths offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say it is unlikely that his call for the aviation industry to develop a standard for the seats, but that he could forget the wave of Sales of M777 x.</seg>

		<seg id="1">One could say that New York City is the birthplace of the stand-up in America: there are almost 100 years old, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes, directly in front of the public, the tone of the conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The innovation of Fay has endured over the years, to be repeated more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 performances in small clubs and theatres.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Most of the stars have emerged in the Carolinas, and have been very successful, until they became too famous for playing in a club,&quot; Hirsch said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We created this festival in order to be able to continue to work with them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of &quot;Stand Up for Heroes,&quot; an evening of music and comedy to benefit veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The festival has grown, as the world of comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Several of the artists participating in the festival this year passed through non-traditional channels, for example, shows small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nick Kroll has appeared on stage in a sitcom about a cable channel (&quot;The League&quot; on the theme of the fantasy football joyfully lusty FXX chain) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Jenny Slate in the TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and is part of the cast of the series &quot;Parks and Recreation,&quot; but it is still best known for his series of viral video &quot;Marcel the Shell With Shoes On.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">Kroll and slate, and other young actors at the singular voice (the pessimistic surreal Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic Advocate for Racial Justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg Talking with Larry David.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a director of cinema and television, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Syria has destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with poisonous gas, said the international body monitoring of chemical weapons on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country in nearly three years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived with a day ahead of the deadline.</seg>
		<seg id="4">November 1 deadline set by the organization, based in The Hague ordered in Damascus to destroy or &quot;render inoperable&quot; all chemical weapons production units and machines used to mix the toxic gases and ammunition.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, Damascus has yet to start the destruction of weapons and existing reserves.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They think that the country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira, which, according to the experts, is a unit of chemical weapons production and storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The militant group, which follows the evolution of the human toll through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120 296 people had died.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Among them, it is estimated that there were 61 72,067 6,365,800 civilians including children.</seg>
		<seg id="12">On the government side, it is estimated that 29 954 members of the armed forces of president bashar al-assad were killed, including 18 678 were combatants of the pro-government forces and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Among the dead, it is also believed that 2,202 were deserters and some 375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It has not updated that figure since.</seg>

		<seg id="18">The Observatory said on Thursday that there were casualties on both sides, but gave no explanation.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by the inspectors in charge of chemical weapons when they need to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that, under tight deadlines.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A statement by the OPCW, which works in close collaboration with the United Nations, indicated that his team was &quot;now satisfied to have controlled - and destroyed-all critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="23">They have not been able to visit the latter two sites because of security concerns, said the inspectors.</seg>
		<seg id="24">On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, &quot;abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program, which had been moved to other sites, which were inspected.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">It was unclear at first whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Two employees of the YMCA, accused of sexual assault allegations made against Jonathan Lord, at a hearing of the Royal Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Two employees of the YMCA of South Wales were accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the royal commission on child sexual abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But in his opening statement to the Committee, the YMCA stated that he &quot;never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Director General Phillip Hare was questioned on two cases: a YMCA employee has been charged with offences relating to child pornography and a physical education instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mr. o'hare told Gail Furness, senior counsel to the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case, but that he was not aware of the second.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was incorrect in stressing, &quot;YMCA external controls were conducted and indicated that children's safety was a top priority for the organization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">It was shown to the commission that the YMCA had been informed that he had received the worst ratings on four institutions in an audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr. o'hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the Personnel Management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any breach of the security policy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was sentenced to six years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But he rejected the idea that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing the staff to report breaches of Lord to the safety of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Staff members have testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, sat her on his lap, told them he loved them and left them playing with his mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, which was overseen by Lord and who had requested training on child protection because she worried about her conduct, said she found the head of children's services in the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which covered Lord &quot;very intimidating and difficult to reach most of the time.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Director General said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report such violations to their supervisor.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Instead, he said that the friendly relations with Lord have blurred their judgment, so that they do not have reported his actions.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. o'hare said he had expressed his views to the board of the YMCA of South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson of &quot;the Jonathan Lord incident&quot; should not be &quot;reporting&quot; by the staff, and the Board had agreed with him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr. Hare has said that the decision to staff to sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the Director General of the YMCA for children's services, Liam Whitley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said the decision was designed to prevent contamination of evidence, but that it was an &quot;excess of zeal&quot; and that she had been poorly implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The YMCA of South Wales was not a reliable organization for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual abuse, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the commission.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, screening, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The hearing was adjourned until December 20.</seg>

		<seg id="2">This revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and said on Thursday evening that the president's close aides had conducted &quot;extensive work in groups and polls end 2011&quot; to see if the eviction of Biden could help Obama in his re-election as its hopes have dwindled.</seg>

		<seg id="7">&quot;Double Down&quot; indicates that Daley has led the charge to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal relationship,&quot; before eventually deciding against the change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list &quot;does not improve significantly the chances of success of Obama.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing Biden by Clinton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I said that I had discussed a series of issues, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley said at the newspaper.</seg>

		<seg id="11">While Daley described the review as &quot;cooperative,&quot; Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested heavily in order to find out whether the change would benefit at the polls.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;The campaigns do not spend much money on polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking measures,&quot; said Martin on AC 360.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, it is not clear whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of a possible reshuffle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">While Daley has said he does not believe that the president &quot;was aware&quot; of the potential change, the former secretary general has admitted that it was &quot;possible&quot; Obama knew.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; final did not respond to the question of whether the political polls had arrived at the Obama office.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that the eviction of Biden's presidential list was discussed.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The European elite is ready to do business with Britain?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of companies together and define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To do so, we commissioned the survey the broadest and most complete with British business leaders and asked them what they thought of the Great Britain, companies and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yougov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, broadly representative of all sizes of companies, sectors, and regions of Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found that the vast majority of companies now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries to modernize and grow while the Member States of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want the Government to give priority to new commercial ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than get bogged down in the long and arduous process of arcane European institutional reform.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When asked their opinion on specific policies, ranging from the regulation of monopolies, the laws on products - the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key skills should return to the hands of Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The single market has caused a general dissatisfaction, saying that the cost of regulation Brussels is disproportionate to the advantages of being part of the European trading area - 40% of big business, traditionally the most pro-european, are even agree.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Finally, and more telling, our survey of business leaders found that a substantial majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives in favour of a change of the treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This conclusion, which is found in all the major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is insisting on a &quot;significant change&quot; that restores power to the United Kingdom.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are high - to change the treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would see a shift of 16% of the votes in favor of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is possible, and necessary, to better represent the interests of British business, since the eurozone is committed towards a closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our investigation show, for businesses this means new focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach from Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's on Friday lowered the credit rating of Ukraine, putting in doubt the capacity of the former Soviet Union, in recession for over a year, to meet its financial obligations.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The public debt of the country is at &quot;B -,&quot; spinning into the speculative investment category.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It is accompanied by a negative outlook, S&amp;P sees at least one chance in three that it be lowered again within a year.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;It is becoming less likely that the government's strategy to ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its large external financing needs,&quot; explains the American agency.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects that the trend will continue.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="7">These reservations, which the authorities have used heavily to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the Agency considers increasingly likely a devaluation, inflating its external debt.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Kiev needs cash to pay for its gas imports from Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay a bill of $882 million.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power at a time of heightened tensions with its Russian neighbour, angered by the will of Kiev to sign an Association Agreement with the EU by the end of November.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy suffered between July and September, its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In a pawnbroker Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore, Janani amirthalinga Dépose a bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in gold to pay school fees for his daughters.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;My husband and I just bought a house so all my money is gone,&quot; says Ms amirthalinga..</seg>
		<seg id="3">While she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, &quot;she said.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In fact, the demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia-where household debt increases - as valuemax, where she completed her transaction, this week became the third loan guarantee to be introduced to the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Pawning jewelry is not just a quick way to get cash - $1,300 for Singapore in the case of Ms amirthalinga-but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In general, the pawn of Singapore collect an annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary, and can make the loans more quickly than the banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to the pawnshops as families feel the pressure of the rising cost of living and the indebtedness of households and consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and the cheap credit fueled by a lax monetary policy in advanced economies, and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers for bridging the difference while their economies were experiencing a slowdown.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week, the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's cited the mounting debt of households, resulting mainly from increases in mortgage lending, as a risk factor for Asian banks' solvency.</seg>
		<seg id="11">She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the ratio of household debt to gross domestic product, the highest in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, while the rate was 60% in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists also worry that the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which came out just this week of a technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The bottom line is that with rising costs, the people in the middle or at the bottom of the wage scale ] looking to supplement their income as they can,&quot; said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The historically high price of gold over the past two years, the people are quick to pledge their personal effects in order to receive the cash value of their jewellery.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore, about 70% of articles pledged in the 200 shops of pawning the city-state are gold.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People say, &quot;The price of gold is high, pawned the gold chain of grandmother and they will look for the next month.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops, easymoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The increase in the loan guarantee that valuemax, operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it already has four shops-but also outside of Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, its general director.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will fund them using 60% of the $66 million from Singapore that she raised this week in his introduction to the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some lenders to cut rates came under criticism for the exorbitant interest rates, Ms. Yeah indicates that the pledge does not only offer lower rates than other lenders, but it does not increase the debt directly.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The customers' mortgage assets they already have, and monetize their personal property does not increase household debt,&quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The pledge is becoming more accepted socially as a means of obtaining secured financing in the short term.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The people who go to the pawnbrokers are also not only those who have financial problems.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The wealthy people in Singapore are also in the shops of pawning valuemax for pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We are seeing clients from all segments of society.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;It can be for wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small companies that have cash to spend a difficult hurdle,&quot; adds Ms. yeah..</seg>

		<seg id="0">The lawyer who advised addicted to a drug's sponsor of a police investigation was jailed</seg>
		<seg id="1">Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough</seg>
		<seg id="2">The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs is revealed in broad daylight</seg>
		<seg id="3">He was sentenced to a prison term of three years by the Court of Assize of Liverpool</seg>
		<seg id="4">A defense lawyer, who had advised a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs is revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough of investigations into his activities connected with drug trafficking after being compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The lawyer, who was nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; and considered by criminals as &quot;a matter of primary importance,&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following the police bugging operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Police officers spotted sarborough, 32, of three bags of cocaine in the home of the lawyer in Blackburn, in Lancashire, while attending a dinner of the bar with colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The investigation revealed that Ditta was a &quot;regular customer&quot; of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for the Scarborough as well as one of his associates.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The four suspects were being monitored at the time by the police in connection with a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the counties of Cumbria, Lancashire, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
		<seg id="11">With 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for a £ 1.5 m, as well as more than 200,000 pounds in cash during a series of raids.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction is revealed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today, the Court of Assizes of Liverpool, Ditta, who works at the law firm of Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, fell into disfavor after he was found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Fall of the Lawyer came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted arriving at the home of Ditta and placing of the pure drug, 60%, in the dustbin of the lawyer in a black golf glove.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Shortly after the tabling, Scarborough has been in regular telephone contact with Ditta which was at a dinner at the football stadium of the Ewood Park club, Blackburn Rovers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer returned home, found the drugs and they are telephoned nine times.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The court heard that Ditta was a &quot;regular&quot; consumers of cocaine after tests showed traces of the drug in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta was arrested later, but denied using cocaine. He said that he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a &quot;legal privilege.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">During his arrest, Ditta picked his portfolio and attempted to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and collected a sample of hair.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In an interview, he said he had an office in his home to his workplace and that customers call him home for legal issues.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the court heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented after arrests key to tell them what investigators were aware.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Public Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;If someone needs to know that it does not violate the law, it is a criminal lawyer.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Mr Ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer, and too involved with individual clients.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relationship that we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to her own lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of its communications will undoubtedly be of legitimate communications because it was her lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But it went far beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.</seg>
		<seg id="29">He interfered with the investigation of the police as much as it could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr Ditta did not honour to her profession, but the mud.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He is too close to some customers, in particular, Scarborough, and he left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta has denied any wrongdoing and said: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after the hearing, the superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr Ditta from criminal lawyer to itself when it began to buy drugs from criminal organizations.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">His addiction to cocaine was never compromised and left it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of leaders of organized criminal groups to obtain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The lawyers should observe the rules of the most stringent integrity and establish a climate of confidence among the public.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Mr Ditta has betrayed that trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The unit responsible for the serious and organised crime in the Lancashire conducted the survey on Mr Ditta, who was found guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and obstructing justice, reflecting its commitment to bring criminals to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This case should serve as a warning to criminals that they know that no one is above the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and bring you to the courts.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough was himself jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Thirty-five other people involved in the smuggling were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On its website, Ditta organized a meeting of questions and answers about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, its last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate it to work.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A difficult year for pharmacists</seg>
		<seg id="1">The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Center of Health and Social Services (CSSS) Laval caused quite a stir in the management of the Hospital of the Cité-de-la-santé and that, during the year 2012-2013.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Because of retirements, maternity leave or departures, the pharmacy department found deficit sharply.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Missing nearly 30% of the staffing requirements, making this fiscal year &quot;very difficult,&quot; according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, the CSSS decided not to hire independent labour, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time pharmacist.</seg>
		<seg id="5">They didn't use the troubleshooting, explained Dr. Beaudet.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Rationalized or reduced some of our activities within the institution to remedy, the time that things would sort themselves out.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Of course, it was hard to get our young [ residents ] to come and stay here.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There is a set of circumstances that we were in a bad situation last year.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Situation improved</seg>
		<seg id="10">After this period, the year 2013 will be much easier for the department of pharmacy of CSSH..</seg>
		<seg id="11">Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after maternity leave and three other pharmacists were hired in recent months.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In addition, the Department's efforts to retain have borne fruit, because the four students currently in residence in Laval also decided to remain in the employment of the CSSS.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Things are much better now, stressed the pharmacist.</seg>
		<seg id="14">By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This will fill our departures last year.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Ever-increasing needs</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, the situation remains delicate.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 have reacted angrily to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be executed by firing squad.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who spent nearly 10 years at large as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He could be released after 15 years on parole.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and left many injured.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He was also convicted of numerous other counts in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prosecutors had requested a life sentence, but they could have asked that the man, described as &quot;Demolition Man&quot; for his reputation as an expert in making bombs, to be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision has rekindled painful memories for June corteen, a mother from Perth who lost both his 39-year-old sister, Jane and Jenny, the destruction perpetrated by Patek and other conspirators there nearly a decade ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">On the verge of tears, she said that Patek have been sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I really think that he ought to follow the same path as other men.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;He should be dragged in front of the firing squad,&quot; said Ms. corteen the PAA.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, to see my daughters.</seg>

		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He fell into a coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and it is &quot;death&quot; three times while he was on life support.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hugues said Patek ought to suffer the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage-Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed there.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Kept alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Spend 20 years in prison after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds of others, it is not much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces will kill the former Al-qaeda Leader, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in order to re-establish links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-qaida.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;He has not delivered,&quot; added Ms corteen..</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently, he cared less about the grief he had caused to others.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;There will be a lot of tears this year,&quot; said Ms corteen..</seg>
		<seg id="26">Patek, however, can appeal against his conviction.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Despite the instructions, the closure should be effective on that date.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Although APHP, prefers to use the term &quot;processing&quot; or &quot;change in continuity.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">As of November 4, the firefighters who were about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency l'hôtel-dieu will be instructed to take the 30 or so serious cases a day to emergencies in other hospitals.</seg>

		<seg id="9">&quot;The emergency service of l'hôtel-dieu must close soon, and for us, it is on 4 November,&quot; insures Loïc Capron, president of the medical commission of Establishment APHP (CME), which supports the project.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;On November 4, there will be more patients brought in by the fire brigade, only people coming through their own means,&quot; confirms Dr. jean-yves Fagon, the medical director of the New l'hôtel-dieu.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;But we will continue to accept emergency patients,&quot; he qualifies, arguing the permanent presence of language-stimulating vehicles on site for serious cases.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Cardinals are the men of the church at the highest levels in the Catholic Church, the Pope and the people who elect, François will appoint its first group of men who ultimately will choose his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are now 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, as soon as a cardinal at the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope -- it belongs to a group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">In a statement announcing the new, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which the bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as a consistory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis has decided to communicate its decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the Cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; Lombardi said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably be declined.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He said that a pope named cardinals in general as much as necessary to ensure that the number of Cardinal electors reaches 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age he wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The consistory next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, said Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the moment, there is a tendency to focus on Europe and Italy in particular.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals of the rest of the world in order to restore the balance,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="12">40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Cardinals will also be the first to be selected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to discuss ways to reform the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Earlier, the pope decide alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now, François chose these eight cardinals to help,&quot; said Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He added that it was &quot;entirely possible&quot; that Francis to the Cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But we have never experienced such a situation-it is totally new.</seg>

		<seg id="9">Her Burmese cat on the knees, in the living room of his apartment in a building on the Avenue Foch, near the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious Eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese, or Korean.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Not counting the pirated editions,&quot; he added, pointing to a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronze or ivory reported from 130 countries surveyed to situate his novels.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader is treated to the traditional coverage with a photo of a young woman in the chest, with a pistol or an assault rifle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat gone broke and contracted by the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launches into packages of all villains, Communists in the 1970s and 1980s, then jihadists from the 1990s.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of sex addict, a dash of violence and torture.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I never had any claim to be a literary writer,&quot; explained Gerard de Villiers.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I consider myself a storyteller who writes for the people that I did not send a message.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He worked &quot;as the great reporters before war, Albert Londres type, who went out and returned with real and lengthy investigations.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">SAS's father said, &quot;a kind of geopolitical paper.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;I'm in my files (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before you go,&quot; added Gerard de Villiers.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people I know for some twenty or thirty years.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The coup, many of its SAS are often prescient: So, a month before the attack from a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in &quot;The Road to Damascus.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">In &quot;The madmen of Benghazi,&quot; he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret command center of the CIA in that city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In 1980, he was directing the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in Cairo &quot;The Plot&quot;, a year before the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In October 2012, in &quot;panic in Bamako,&quot; he chronicled the 4x4 columns of jihadists that based on the Malian capital.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I am not clairvoyant, defended Gerard de Villiers, I am simply assumptions from the country that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.</seg>
		<seg id="25">After these trips in troubled areas, he would sit for a month behind its IBM typewriter to Marguerite dating back to 1976, &quot;where all of the pieces were changed.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="26">300 pages later, he wrote the word &quot;end&quot; and corrected each page in pen.</seg>
		<seg id="27">On the walls of his office are hung with AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with warlords in Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Regularly singled out for machismo by feminist and leagues for racism by human rights organisations, Gerard de Villiers departed these charges in two sentences.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.</seg>
		<seg id="30">I am always welcomed in Africa, where I have so many readers.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Gerard de Villiers said: &quot;Malko Linge, like all heroes, not age.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="32">He will not die and will not retreat.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Not more than me.</seg>
