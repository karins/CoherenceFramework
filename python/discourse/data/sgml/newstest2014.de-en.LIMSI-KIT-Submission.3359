		<seg id="3">The combined rate of English literature and language will be abolished.</seg>
		<seg id="4">From 2015, pupils need a separate GCSE-exams for language, and there are strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.</seg>

		<seg id="6">Other core subjects will be changed next year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In a separate initiative, Ofqual, announce the supervisory authority for exams, a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new Benotungs system and less course work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In a speech in the summer, said Education Minister Michael Gove, that there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence, &quot; emphasizing that GCSEs would be &quot; more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">Studies show that in English schools spent less time for mathematics – 116 hours per year, or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In contrast, Australian schools teach 143 hours a year on average, students receive in Singapore 138 hours.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the curriculum, but coalition circles, it says the comprehensive math exam – combined with a greater weighting of Bac in rankings, schools will probably encourage more hours.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The curriculum is placed more emphasis on &quot;problems in the real life&quot;, including financial mathematics.</seg>

		<seg id="4">The officials</seg>
		<seg id="5">I have been asked to write to you regarding your inquiry to mass surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">My name is Joseph Edward Snowden and was contractually or via a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of law by my government, which led me from a moral duty to act.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As a result of the publication of these concerns, I felt I faced a serious and persistent propaganda which forced me to leave my family and my home.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Citizens around the world, and also high officials - including the United States - have the revelations to a system of mass surveillance, which is answerable to, as a service to the public.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The spying revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and directives, which were aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The benefits to society from these findings is becoming clearer; at the same time, the risks in visibly reduced.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government treated dissent remains as fidelity and seeks to criminalise political freedom of expression and should be indicted.</seg>
		<seg id="15">However, the truth is not a crime.</seg>
		<seg id="16">I am confident that the government of the United States will drop this damaging attitude with the support of the international community.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I hope that, if the difficulties are resolved this humanitarian situation, I will be able to participate in the responsibility of a full investigation of the facts relating to the media statements, particularly in terms of truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with law.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or with your mobile device from</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 &quot;CNN Heroes of 2013&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to elect him to the &quot;CNN Hero of the Year&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The winner gets $250000 to continue its exceptional work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">21 years saw Georges Bwelle of his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals, which did not have the resources to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First, he had a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation, expanding on his brain, causing a Hämatom that should affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There was no neuro-surgeons in Cameroon,&quot; says Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have him released from Cameroon, if we had had the money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not easy,&quot; commented Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can run at five o 'clock in the morning to leave the house and to the hospital, to be the first one, and it is not first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are very many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Indeed, some people die because they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In contrast, the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But even if there was a doctor for them, could not afford most Cameroonians the visit.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">To see his father and so many of his country people suffer in mature Bwelle decided to do something about it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have conducted last year 700 free operations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He himself was a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, he squeezed and up to 30 people in minibuses and continue with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof of unbefestigtes terrain to the villages that need help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Not everything is proceeding smoothly.</seg>
		<seg id="32">More than once they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle – with his broad smile and his boundless energy – in the joyful celebration.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team then begins with the examination of hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Each trip we treat 500 people,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village – and on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening, the team simple operations with local anaesthetic.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations are usually in a school, the City Hall or an apartment; after the surgery, the patients and the recreation area in order to make room for the next.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The lighting for the surgery and the Desinfektions equipment is fed by the generator of the group and Bwelle and his volunteers until the early hours on Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is an arduous tasks, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They drum all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – free operations carried out last year, 700 and knows that it is an enormous difference to the people with their work, which helps them.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man explained that the free operation of a hip break he received enabled him to return to work.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;It changed the future of my family,&quot; said the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital works Bwelle night in private clinics in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="51">With this second job he finanziere 60% of his charitable work, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I really do not know when he is asleep,&quot; says Katie O 'Malley, who participates in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He is always either in hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">Support for medical and nursing students like O 'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or instruments for Bwelle Dr.,&quot; says O 'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The students pay for their trip to Cameroon usually themselves, often with donated medical equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But once in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is undoubtedly a hero,&quot; says O 'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bwelle is almost no permanent workload.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Others to give to a happier life, and thus to fulfill a promise he made to his father, he has a great deal of pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I am doing this work,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I am thinking of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I do it to make people laugh, and in order to alleviate the pain.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will for the first time on 22 February, appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are the ones who choose a Pope Francis, so that it will appoint the first group of men who ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Currently there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years, no longer take part in the papal election – which is a group of 120 cardinals eligible &quot;choice&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In a statement, said the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as a consistory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the Konsistoriums in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,&quot; said Lombardi.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably be dropped until February.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He explained that a pope usually take so many cardinals as necessary so that the number of voters 120 cardinals 1.44 again, and so many cardinals over 80, as he likes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The consistory next year is important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Currently, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and especially Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Francis founded the Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have to find ways to reform the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; said Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He explained that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that the Cardinals Francis ask for advice.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But so far we have not been in this situation, it is all very new.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to cardinals, but Francis sponges &quot;full of surprises, so we do not know who he appoints.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">Europe's elite is prepared to do business with Britain?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to the table and to define what those who want to change in the UK for prosperity and work, in our relations with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To this end, we have the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders commissioned and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov interviewed more than 1000 forces command from the economy, the British company sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results of the survey will surprise many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exported outside Europe and focused on countries modernize and grow, while the countries stagnate in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want to be favored by the government side, new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than with the long and arduous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Asked for their opinion on certain regulatory issues, from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders is of the opinion that control over these key skills should be brought back to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was widespread dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to the company in the meantime, the costs of the Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe's trade zone, even 40% of large companies agreed to the traditionally friendly in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of economic leaders that a clear majority of Britain wants a course in the direction of change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU, which is based on trade, not on policy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This realization, with companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot;meaningful change&quot;, which brings a return to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain at 16 percent, to a change of opinion in favour of the EU in a popular vote.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Prime Minister should have no doubt that this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK's conditions for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that the business of renegotiating a major shift of power back to Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A better deal for the British economy is possible and necessary, increasingly, after the eurozone now toward closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means for companies with a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten, and only a few months ago, made his first steps, and his Shetland pony toffee trotted only loosely through the three rounds and got the first prize – with 30 adult opponents.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The inseparable pair, both the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.</seg>
		<seg id="4">When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee with the ring.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which would be far beyond his age.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And toffee received top marks for his appearance and his personality.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Fenton had toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and practiced every day with the Shetland pony.</seg>
		<seg id="8">His mother, Donna, 30, said: &quot;Fenton and toffee are a great team.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="14">He ran on sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny that he has done a fantastic job.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, which he cares.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As it is, it won't be long until it is on the &quot;horse of the Year&quot; show – and I am sure he will do well.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are linked to the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government cannot waste federal state money.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take &quot;immediate action&quot; to avert a crisis that has been caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the Tasman independent MPs Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government has an emergency rescue package that we believe that the unique challenges faced by the federal government,&quot; said Plibersek today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Through further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey Star, residues are to be eliminated.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In addition, there is money for clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, specialist training, services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments reflect the ideas that have affected hospital staff said that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,&quot; said Tanya Plibersek.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman government duty.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The federal government should maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and the monthly report on how the extra money has been spent.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A three-member commission will be established and is intended to ensure that the federal state of health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As Wilkie said today that the 325 million dollars would be of little use if &quot;they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable path.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless, he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for urgent aid, which he first against the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I am confident that the federal aid will be a major contribution to the public health system of the federal state from the list of concerns,&quot; said Wilkie.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The 2 US appeal court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until decided on an appeal of the city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The judge had ruled in August, the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way in which the programme will be implemented for the stopping and questioning of people.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city appealed against their assessment and the remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body that should support the police in amending its directive and the corresponding training programme.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The appeal court heard on Tuesday's arguments on the requested suspension.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The nomination report stated that the judge had to be discharged from the case because she had breached the code of conduct for US judge, is that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements, in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-Frisk program.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bomb attack in Bali, reacted angrily at the verdict on the last of the instigator, who was brought to court, as Umar Patek should be summarily executed in their opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia in flight, was yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing sentenced to a prison sentence of 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">With criminal suspension, he could be released after 15 years.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A guilty verdict was also in a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even though they can apply for the man who, because of his reputation as meisterlicher bomb builders as &quot;Demolition Man,&quot; the death penalty.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision was painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his Mitverschwörern almost ten years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Fighting back tears, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I really think that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;We should put him in front of a Erschießungs command,&quot; said Corteen to AAP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I have to live with that every day that I will receive no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Sari Club was razed to the ground, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11.00 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck was parked in front of the nightclub.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier to explode a suicide bombers a backpack filled with explosives.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He fell after the attack a month into a coma and died &quot; three times, while he hung on a Lebenserhaltungssystem.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hughes said that Patek was deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Let him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.</seg>
		<seg id="18">To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds, is not much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He cheated nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces nearly four months later killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the negotiation of an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided to point out that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden, with the aim to rebuild the connection between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;He did not,&quot; said Corteen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has inflicted on other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The verdict came before the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year, with commemorations in Bali and Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;This year there will be many tears,&quot; said Corteen.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc. reported a 15% drop in net profits on Thursday after he was declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bombardier could be based in Montreal, published no flight test data for its new aircraft of the CSeries and gave no new information on whether the aircraft under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the Jungfernflug of test aircraft followed one and a half months, so far, only three more starts, which begs the question of whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;sector perform&quot; in view of the fact that the shares in the next one to two quarters has a limited potential rate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Although weaker delivery figures were largely expected on aircraft, but the margins in the development of trans-sports field, we are clearly disappointed,&quot; said Doerksen in a customer.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that new orders for the Bombardier CSeries, if the test program is proceeding on the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the aircraft series of CSeries can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test aircraft was introduced in March, the public and flew for the first time after months of delays in September.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new Düsenverkehrsflugzeugs is correct.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Board Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The company's management assured on Thursday, in addition to analysts and the media, the program is in the schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test aircraft is no longer on the ground than we expected,&quot; said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft had been ground tests and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Each manufacturer is planning differently.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, what we have done.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This is happening throughout the flight programme.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was said by company.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the Jungfernflug the first customer is an aircraft of the CSeries.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said, check the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and will update them in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;The slow progress of the test flight, even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning – reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015,&quot; said Doerksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter coincided with the end on 30 September Bombardiers net profits to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The adjusted earnings per share is 9 cents unchanged.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Sales slipped slightly and fell from 4.2% to 4.1 billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenues of 4.56 billion dollars, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Net orders fell from 83 aircraft on 26.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The contract was the aerospace division was 32.9 billion on September 30 dollars and was unchanged compared to 31 December.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In the field of aerospace, the results were within the framework of our targets, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing,&quot; said Beaudoin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the turnover has increased in this division by nearly 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The contract was in the transport sector, on September 30, $32.6 billion and was slightly increased compared to 31 December.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems with some large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">According to the company's leadership, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their targets so that passengers on their devices during critical phases of flight read e-books, videos, or play, provided they are in the &quot;flight mode.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed, but there are many people angry that they can't read at the launch and landing their e-books.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Australian companies are watching the decision to implement the US airlines oodles of work, but no immediate plans to change their rules.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The air traffic control authority CASA also declared that they will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;CASA currently has no specific rules on use of electronic devices on the plane,&quot; has been forthcoming on that.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain security at any time and passengers follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew.</seg>

		<seg id="11">&quot;Our current guidelines, electronic equipment at the launch and landing may not be used, and we currently have no plans to change that,&quot; the company said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, of which passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The decision has an impact on U.S. companies vary depending on the age of the fleet.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and manuals, training materials, hand luggage-change programs and customer training.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers using portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at every level,&quot; the FAA announced.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which leaves the tail of a dog with his mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail to the right wedelten (from the perspective of the dog), while it was the left-hand side in nervous dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other dogs can these subtle differences and respond to it.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist of the University of Trento, said: &quot;in humans is well known that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli, positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we have tried to look at this in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right brain hemisphere is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs on the lateral tail leaves react to their fellows, the researchers monitored the animals, while other dogs these films.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed the behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">We will probably soon understand why the tail in two moves in the opposite direction</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;we have shown the dogs films with dogs, either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">If the animals looked like a dog's tail otherwise free expression, moved to the right() has seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog, they remained completely relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But it was mainly the tail slope to the left (from perspective of the dog wag), their heart rate rose and they saw restless.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Professor Vallortigara communicate the dogs not deliberately by these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience that movements they should worry and when not.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He said: &quot;if you have several encounters with other dogs and a swish with the tail in one direction is linked with friendly behaviour and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of this experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and visiting fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol explained that this was not the first study, which was investigated, both left and right is important for dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year there was a team from the University of Lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left, when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada: &quot;dogs tend to go to a robot dog, if his ' tail wag ' on the left and the right not to be restless – just the opposite, as in the Italian study.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to his statement, the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies, the animals in the movies or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;Although there is considerable evidence of many different types of mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details have yet to be determined, and dogs are no exception,&quot; says Bradshaw.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Since their behavior but simply put, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail, sometimes in one, sometimes moving in the opposite direction.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said, &quot;the project will bring Britain closer together.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said that he was delighted to work with the British Government on this plan.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">After the completion of phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and the north of England of £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion.</seg>

		<seg id="3">In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many steps to the house and no longer in the apartment, she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Moreover, since a meniscus tears operation, the Mittfünfzigerin have experienced what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.</seg>

		<seg id="11">When she moved more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment located in the green.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Today, in his mid-fifties Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But she also knows that she is one of the few people who could deal with the issue of ' living in old age.</seg>

		<seg id="40">This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Although we could install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the road paved with stairs to the street would be a far greater obstacle.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light</seg>
		<seg id="3">He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
		<seg id="4">A well-known criminal defense lawyers, a drug baron warned of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The lawyer of Kriminalisten as &quot;first class&quot; vaunted, nicknamed &quot;bash&quot; was arrested in his house in 2011, after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Officials watched as Scarborough (32), three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, ablieferte, while this was the lawyer chamber with colleagues during a meal.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All four suspects were monitored by the police as part of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West York.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They, together with 32 other people were later arrested after the police in a series of raids of heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200000 in cash ensured.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction can be known.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today, Ditta, who works for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at Liverpool Crown Court after three weeks of two counts of obstruction of justice, found guilty and sentenced.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He admitted the cocaine possession in a previous survey.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The lawyer was convicted after the police in their investigations of Scarborough found that this was in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two officials of the investigation followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove in the dustbin of the lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, called Scarborough regularly with Ditta, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer returned home, the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In court, it became known that Ditta was a &quot;regular&quot; consumers of cocaine after tests of class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta was later arrested, but denied to take cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because it was his client, and claimed that their discussion 'ed &quot;lawyer secret.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and he was taken from a hair sample.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The police interrogation, he admitted, he both under his home address and an office at the work place and clients would call him at home because of legal issues.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In court, it became known that he has important players in the drug trade, some of which he had previously called for significant arrests and had informed about what the investigators knew about it.</seg>
		<seg id="24">State lawyer Anne Whyte said: &quot;a criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you are not breaking the law.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender, because he has too much with certain clients.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relationship is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But that went far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.</seg>
		<seg id="29">He was the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr Ditta brought to his profession in disrepute.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He was certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence has been compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing and claimed: &quot;if I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but to do so immediately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after hearing the superintendent Lee Halstead said by the police in Lancashire: &quot;Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender a criminal when he began to buy drugs from organised criminals.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">His cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and trust and confidence in the public eye.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Ditta has betrayed that trust and trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and bring you to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison, after the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade was found guilty.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Thirty-five more involved in the drugs ' people were sentenced to total fines of 153 years for drug offences.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On his website published Ditta an area with questions and answers about where he, his dream job, as a lawyer to represent clients in the cell death in America, his ultimate dinner guest was Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The railway crossing &quot;Hirschen&quot; lavishly rebuilt to increase traffic safety?</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yes, the local councils have decided.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Schiltach has to 220000 euros.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Deutsche Bahn wants to improve in the coming year the Kinzigtal-rail route.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Especially to enhance safety at level crossings are regularly - it is far to collisions of trains with other vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The communities into, they need to be involved with one third of the costs, the rest are divided and federal.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained the specifics of Bahübergangs &quot;Hirschen.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">The city plans to build the railway tracks a bulge in the west of the tunnel mouth.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There could also larger vehicles, such as those transporting logs, with oncoming traffic, without having to block the tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could expand the subsequent road in due time, in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This has been controversial in the council, as some councils, the need for a proliferation of roads in doubt: Thomas tilt with his statement, the mood of the critics to the point: &quot;we need to, because so few vehicles so much money?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mayor Thomas Haas said: the railway crossing Hirschen will be regularly used for Langholztransporte.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Even wood constrcution Kuhbach &quot; partly transported via this route, because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route to the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn on the main street.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In addition, the route serves as Umleitungfür those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main street is blocked, Haas argued.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Since it was that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel and should be rehabilitated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing &quot; Hirschen for a longer period of important traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The councils agreed to examine the costs would cause the idea of broadening the road.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless, was approved by a majority of the reconstruction of the railway crossing, with the proviso that the necessary retaining wall will be built so that the city of the subsequent direction &quot;Bahnhofstraße&quot; for encounters traffic increase to around 5.5 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The reconstruction of the railway crossing in leather Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the &quot;Geroltzhäuser path to increase substantially.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">The administration had examined the renovation plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger, because they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser route was still possible.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The investigation came to the conclusion that it is not inconceivable that the inclination of road conditions that could lead to longer picked vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Responsibility for this, in turn, the city as Straßenbaulastträgerin.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The renovation could therefore liability disputes.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Since both the wood collection and were left in the current state of development, we should not support the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train, with a good view of the transition of the vehicle is significantly lower than in the other train passes, because right in the mid-point, to which a connection.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even trains from the main railway station should be slowed down at this point that no threatening collision.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The majority of the reconstruction of this railway crossing refused to consent, as the city Schiltach should suffer the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles &quot;,&quot; the councils, as the train after the completion of the construction work could withdraw from the responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As the panel considers the modifications to the railway crossings &quot;Heubach&quot; and &quot;Kuhbach,&quot; for the already Kreuzungs agreements have been reached by train.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of the destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable, which is aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But Damascus has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.</seg>
		<seg id="8">According to estimates there are about 1000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The announcement came at a time when, on Thursday, fighting in the town of Safira, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites, such as the UK-based Syrian observatory for human rights.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson was allegedly &quot;phone-hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
		<seg id="2">State prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World in May 2005 have heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his attractive &quot;special adviser&quot; Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack voicemails Pawlbys, and she pursued, but Coulson called them and left messages, as the court was told.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;According to the prosecutor's office is Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, no one stands in front of the apartment by people hoping to catch them in flagrante delicto, but one that people are faced with a story to see their reaction,&quot; said Edis.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: grow up faster</seg>
		<seg id="1">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age, as studies show.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes mean not directly puberty</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a cause of early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A mother should be worried if her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents – normally, this is not a sign that is rapidly entering puberty,&quot; explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and Achselhaare and body odor, with girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;If the development of breasts begins, it will still take at least two to three years to Menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: the essential guide to deal with this problem frequently occurring.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test, as puberty progresses.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is controversial, as indeed is the beginning of puberty, but it is &quot;precocious&quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process is slowed down or stalled – something that can closely monitor a pediatrician.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Tests by a Endikronologen displayed so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded for faster progress.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are methods of treatment to delay an early menstruation and another consequence: the premature ageing of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small body grew in adults.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psycho-social aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: &quot;the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavior problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age mates.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their young daughters have the period.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter has received her ten days.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She was scared and excited by the school home because it was the first in her circle of friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or the cause of sexual messages in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Young are similar to girls in puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He supported the implementation of a study on girls in 2001 at the age of six to nine years, a link between body fat and entry into puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country tend to be African-American and Hispanic girls puberty rather than their white age.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations for this.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions on the climate to the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another mystery: although the boys face and Schambehaarung earlier grows, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is even babies and toddlers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their doctor, how they should speak with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;This may mean that you must sooner than expected,&quot; advised Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If we remain quiet, the child usually reacts well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls bloom early, need the insurance, the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 accusations against child carers Jonathan Lord of Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But the opening statement before the Commission had declared the YMCA, you had to do with never an incident of child sexual abuse &quot;in the organization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Business leader Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee was charged with offences of child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was in 1991 because of the abuse he follow children.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assistierenden Commission that he had known of the first case, the second was not known.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also vague on the assertion that &quot;there have been external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he has received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Educational Department) in August of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the line &quot;I failed to down&quot; in the recruitment of Lord and not ensured that staff had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Lord had been convicted of sexual offences in twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA at the beginning of the year.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff, Lords to report offences in relation to the safety of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The employees said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she worked as a babysitter, they sit on his lap, said that he liked it, and children playing with his mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord and had asked for a training on child protection, because she was worried about his behavior, said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat, the Lords in the YMCA Caringbah the chief was very intimidating, &quot;and most of the time was very remote.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The business leader said that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to reimburse their superiors.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Instead, he said, but their friendship with Lord their judgment impaired assets, which is why they had not reported it.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson to draw the organization from the Jonathan Lord incident &quot;, &quot; not reporting affects &quot; by staff, and the board voted for him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Hare said the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations had been made by the business leaders of the children's services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented, but it was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly implemented.</seg>

		<seg id="11">To see about five metres high ruins of handtellergroßen stones.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;There are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D.,&quot; says Schulze.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Before it goes to the light of day, Schulze leaves the participants on the upper level still take a look at a dark shaft, 15 metres deep.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is hardly noticed.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Next station of this walk is the Pretorian, and here the participants climb back down into the depths.</seg>
		<seg id="16">We are seeing here is the office of the once-powerful man north of the Alps, the Prätors CCAA.</seg>
		<seg id="17">What does CCAA, would like to know a visitor.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;The acronym stands for&quot; Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium &quot;, which means in plain English as much as&quot; city of Roman law and the city of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the Emperor &quot;cult&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And the Pretorian is the former proconsul Palace, the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots the choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">A new day, a new horror story to independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland was required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This provides the cue for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the Hadrianswalls.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In fact, in the Strathclyde template referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was – according to expectations – no role in the headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">No one has mentioned that the EU member states often bent strict rules when it is convenient for them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what you really want from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So not really a story.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And one that has already happened in the years that it already resembles a fossil, the first time I heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; duck at least 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is an interesting interes lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that dances to the tune of Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why the London yoke against the trade from Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, adopted after the war is faltering.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Throughout the EU, parties are gaining ground, hostile to the EU or the euro as a common currency would throw overboard.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany, founded this year – nearly five million votes in the Bundestags election in September to acquire and distribute effectively the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The current economic crisis is a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the straitjacket, forced into the national economy by adhering to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits – that was the case in Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Instead, the Eurosystem has its members pinned down on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters, and the German politicians would like.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency is southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of the imposed by Brussels ' green ' energy policies – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grange mouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All of the world Lohnfestschreibungen protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap US shale gas.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader for the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that Germany was kept in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">However, Berlin, Paris does not need more than a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, the ailing French economy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU anti-National Front has just won a key by-election, and thus the ruling Socialists in third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right wing would automatically mean benefits for the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen with their newly gained popularity among the white French working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-EU currency bloc in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and it is very possible – it could for the first time such a block dominate the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come together to the abolition of the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it is something like the &quot;Europe&quot; (sovereign nations), the favored General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and some of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that Britain distanced himself from the project in the hope to curry favour with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Where is Scotland in all this?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can decide to be a region (ultimately little England).</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels to say what they can hinstecken where.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a looser European network, if we keep our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other countries, similar thinking is not a federal Europe of the Nations Group easier.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should consider Norway and retain our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP government in Scotland – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and won) made cuts, which had the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence, only to be imposed from Berlin and Brussels austerity.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no phone conversations)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Passengers can now hear from departure to landing their electronic devices to read, work, games, music, and use the prestige of films, but not with the mobile phone, the new guidelines, which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly they would be implemented, would depend on the respective airline, said FAA employees Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The airlines, the FAA must prove that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the arrangements for the storage of the devices, according to the new rules.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said that she had already received some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA announced in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers must switch smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They should start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers, and the captain gives the green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">When entering the landing, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again, before the plane landed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the devices at launch, landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most new transport aircraft and other pilots with the use of Wi-Fi in altitudes, should meet the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;If the new system is implemented – and we are working closely with the airline, both sides will benefit from this,&quot; said Glading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We are frankly tired of having to feel like watchdogs on this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But continued banned Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres, the agency explained.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers are urged to make smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So there is still no &quot;words With Friends,&quot; the scrabble like online game played by the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone, when he had to leave Öffentlichkeits effectively an American Airlines jet because he refused to shut down the device, while the plane was parked on the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored as a Verletzungs risk if they fly through the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain banned.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The regulatory authority for telephone conversations at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA lifts may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the traffic safety agency National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert for national traffic issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disruptions to navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air also disrupt transmission towers,&quot; said Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An advisory committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this matter, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on the use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCas kill from Missouri argue that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult because the use of the devices is omnipresent.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In some studies, up to one third of the passengers forget about the closure of the device or ignored.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of malfunctions of navigation and communications equipment were of passengers bears FM radios, which at the time of the latest technology trend.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they have no electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The pilots adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less susceptible to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be eligible for the increased use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, said Huerta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices in general, much less radio radiation than previous generations.</seg>
		<seg id="36">E-reader example, only minimal radiation, if you umblättert.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But when downloading or sending data, the transmission of values.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The advocates of an easing of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, an employee of passenger aircraft Kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risks in the use of equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers Association passenger said he was of the opinion that the disruption by the device is real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other committee members said that there are only scattered reports of pilots who spoke for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots in landing instruments under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the equipment by the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a sensible adjustment for travellers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with the security,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;We want to involve the people at an early stage in the planning,&quot; mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event for flood protection concept in Gechingen.</seg>
		<seg id="2">About 80 participants had come into the town hall to explain the measures planned to ask questions, to express concerns and ideas.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Häußler was clear: &quot;the ultimate decisions the members of the council.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">The flooding that Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared, was a crucial event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, so Häußler.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A river basin study was in the neighbouring village Aidlingen commissioned, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The protection of as many cultivated plots is the goal,&quot; says Häußler.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Is planning the protection against a statistically, according to the German weather service every 100 years of expected flooding.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Climate change is a 15-percent surcharge.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is &quot;HQ 100a climate&quot; in expert circles.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The floods which have caused significant damage in 2009 Gechingen corresponded to a 1000-year flood.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There is not an absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,&quot; says Häußler.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In order to achieve the protection HQ 100a climate, must be invested in Gechingen around four million euros, and the municipality can count on country grants amounting to around 70 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But Häußler pointed out that the promotion only if an overall concept will be implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The town is dependent on the participation of the citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="15">An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.</seg>
		<seg id="16">At best, 2016 could be started with the implementation.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Among other things, the concept of protection, which has already been presented last week in the local council (reported) local measures in the tributary of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Among other things, has been called into question, why not more dams and Rückhaltebecken are planned for the protection of the site.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Gregor Kühn, planners of the commissioned engineering firms forest and Corbe from hill, who presented the concept, stressed that it needs all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Moreover, it is to find the most economical solution, Joachim forest of forest and Corbe.</seg>
		<seg id="22">There was resentment in countries bordering the Altorts, even in normal storm rains suffer an overload of the canal network.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The problem is well known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders</seg>
		<seg id="1">Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute revolves around the seat width, the passengers will be offered on long flights in economy class – not always those that most airlines, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that this should be decided by the airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft are competing to sell even bigger versions of its twin-engine long-range aircraft, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As the rear of the aircraft, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the specified economic results, which is to deliver the new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; design.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing claims its modernized &quot;777X&quot; take 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and ten per line.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says that the competing version of the A350 befördere 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in economy class, and there are nine per line.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details through advertisements in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now, Airbus appealed before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Recently, the company has an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and donors showed a picture in which squeezed three people sitting in a restaurant, and the title: &quot;would you accept that?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo-prop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In light of changed eating habits, people are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years increased by ten percent, the data from the US Department of Health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Taillenumfang of the male average American is in the 21 century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly getauften &quot;jet Set&quot; was narrow.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It was, Airbus, conducted research that showed that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat raises the sleep quality by 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing denies the figures from Airbus to the seat and says it is not at the discretion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The company also said, according to studies, the experience in the aircraft of more than the seat width.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It really boils down to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to succeed,&quot; explains the Flugkabinenexperte Kent Craver of Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, there is more freedom elbows, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export performance of the US or Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficient per seat than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Boeing's statements on the results partly depend on the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products,&quot; says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in European Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, analysts say, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777 indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Eighteen inch seat width would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from an economic face from the Airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777,&quot; says Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin furnishing, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines can choose.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The world travelers jet sellers even tape measure, for the creation of gherkins in the competition.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Even if they advertise the comfort, but also offer all manufacturers jets with highly condensed form for low-cost airlines and regional flights.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but has not yet been sold, according to its own statement.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more cabin adaptability and wide seats for some jets in the corridors.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but could distract from the wave of 777X-sales.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Veganism is subordinate to the vegetarianism, according to dictionaries, differs from this, but in a very significant way.</seg>
		<seg id="1">While vegetarians are eating cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, they provide are not on the menu of a Veganers.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan from all the consumption of animal products, including honey is denied.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What remains, one might wonder, but on closer inspection the vegan diet world through a remarkable provokers wealth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Brotaufstriche are very popular,&quot; said Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the house of reform, which holds a number of special products for vegans.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For 13 years, the native New Zealanders live vegan, he finds in Lampertheim (almost) everything that he needs to live. &quot;In 1997, I asked my diet and became a vegetarian.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">At the turn of the century was the next step and I became a vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;But the conviction was not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice,&quot; says Proctor, art leather prefers plain leather.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He realized that there is no animal products in other everyday concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is primarily a vegan ethics.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I do not want to see animals must die for me,&quot; Proctor speaks from the maxim of vegan, which covers the entire consumer behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Instead of burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears hinterherzutrauern, vegans have quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;It is a double bonus,&quot; says Proctor today, &quot;vegan is not a renunciation, no asceticism, but it is an asset.&quot; The assumption that the nutritional change the selection of dining options, Proctor brings more to the power of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And it is exactly these conditions could also have some well-intentioned attempt to fail.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The addictive is a crucial factor, which leaves many fast, as with smoking,&quot; Proctor is a comparison.</seg>
		<seg id="16">And: &quot;certain tastes are not&quot; to the animal.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Often it is the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;But you can also create the same effect in other ways,&quot; the vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Bring to a barbecue example Proctor, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Vegan sausages.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He pays attention to a balanced, the colourful rich diet, once rich taste.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Of course you want to have something between the teeth, it is legitimate.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;It is to taste, but it is not only to reduce animal food,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that he had not suffered.</seg>
		<seg id="24">For me, the change has had a positive aspect.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I am no stranger to cholesterol and have an increased proportion of vitamins.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are high-performance athletes who are exclusively vegan diet.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;My blood values are, I am often check,&quot; Mr. Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Especially against the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Because animals are fed with feed, rather than to graze on the pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the Kühlt calm, the vitamin B12 share is high,&quot; Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;My B12 values are in order,&quot; he explains.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Distances Proctor should not go for the food fund raising.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Basic food resources are there, and every supermarket has now soy milk and other products.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Everything I need, I think on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="35">And I buy something special.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that is what is known for&quot; ordinary &quot;finished products.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="37">Anyway, the preparation veganer courts is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;In the kitchen, there is much to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not in part to achieve better results,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could bring his in-laws.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Family firm gives a new vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="41">This dynamic, when you cook, it has a new significance.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;The situations that can arise as diverse as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="43">He was, of course, but also scepticism.</seg>
		<seg id="44">You enjoy my food?</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;I now feel bad because I drink milk?&quot; - with questions of this kind must act as vegans with tact.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;I do not reject people, yes, I am part of this society,&quot; Proctor would not enclaves.</seg>
		<seg id="47">And a closer look at the everyday world appears to be not so vegan as suspected - and not the vegan so restricted in everyday life, as is commonly believed.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Even fast food is allowed.</seg>
		<seg id="49">French fries are everywhere!</seg>
		<seg id="50">&quot;Many Dönerläden offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In a pizzeria is ordered to pasta, or a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="52">The restaurants are so slow it.</seg>
		<seg id="53">&quot;When I started 13 years ago, vegan diet, everything was much more difficult,&quot; the New Zealanders can locate a development: &quot;you must talk to the people, they point out.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="54">&quot;If enough requests, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,&quot; he hopes.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Vegane restaurants, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café bird.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Proctor is the wish that other restaurants have at least a vegan dish on the menu.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusively.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Meat dishes are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,&quot; Proctor says.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way, mostly from the outset,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="61">But the purchase veganer products can be rather difficult at the beginning.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Especially if you learn to understand the additives in animal peanuts as color donors can leave seems to comply with the ethics with so many obstacles and traps quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: &quot;Veganissimo - personal content and their alternatives,&quot; explains the many content substances, the food but also be entombed cleaning agents.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot; Gradually, it developed a scanner and knows it has to pay attention to the signs and logos, &quot; sometimes it is better to take small steps as or to stumble, &quot; Proctor knows.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Veganism, it is an important moral enough to raise awareness.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Perhaps he is not quite that his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to take a critical look at their habits.</seg>

		<seg id="0">New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking mess</seg>
		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime of nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Before tests on humans will be needed more tests, which can still take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the first results are good.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We are very message that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all methods available on the market, but that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,&quot; says Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the manufacture of nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies to the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoking no nicotine-high.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine in their normal activity level.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mice without vaccination against it had taken a &quot;break&quot;, the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine reaches the brain.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The experiments are described in the journal Science in translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The vaccination had to be given to maintain the Antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As Professor Crystal said that a future vaccine would be administered to people, if he was sure children before they enter into temptation to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They know that if they begin to smoke, they feel no pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them the habit,&quot; he explains.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that it was still a need for further research.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohamed Morsi sets the presidential oath, but his day of triumph will not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country, and thus the succession of Hosni Mubarak, 16 months earlier had been expelled from office.</seg>
		<seg id="3">With his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He put the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile and is based on an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, a true democracy and stability,&quot; said the 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that since its founding in 84 years, mostly as an organisation banned by the respective government targeted.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, when Morsi arrived shortly after 11.00 a.m. local time in a small car convoy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidential pomp Mubarak-era was only briefly stopped traffic so that the auto convoy was able to cross the usually bustling street that connects the city centre, with the southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">As a uncharismatisches &quot;Ersatzrad&quot; the Brotherhood has mocked his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Freitags speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak to your destination.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; said Morsi judges dressed in a blue suit with a red tie in the wood-panelled chamber in which he craftsman sworn in.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his Antritts speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem, he was listening to Habachtstellung.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of those present in the largest auditorium of the university with chanting &quot;the army and the people are one hand&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The university was built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education in Cairo has developed into a stronghold of Islamist groups of students in the 1970s.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi, on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birth place of the uprising last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers, the SCAF assumed by the head of state hunted out of office.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But with the divestment of the official oath before the court and not in front of Parliament, as usual, he is pandering to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Morsi's speech at the Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to require up to $100 for passengers who want to stow hand luggage on their flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though, in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the entire box.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new fee applies to hand luggage in the baggage compartment of the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said it charged $25 if the fee will be paid in advance and $100 for travelers who paid only on the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said the fee of $100 is introducing travelers to move in advance about the payment.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We do not want to calculate this sum,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second to checked baggage fees.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers who tried to circumvent this, therefore, as much as possible, plugged in your hand luggage, which means that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O 'Malley said, the new fee, it is not really about money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that a passenger on the flight of Frontier may charge a baggage, but the next person has to pay 100 dollars for a similar piece of luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O 'Malley said, the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed of the charges before they come to the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The new hand baggage fee of Frontier is only in the summer, we do not yet have an exact date.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often grumble at baggage charges and other fees, but airlines like to fall back on.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that the transportation of baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street, the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Most so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago, the first to charge for hand luggage and later, Allegiant Air, a low-cost carriers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely followed the extra charges.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the Spirit hand luggage fee $50 million a year equals.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with Spirit and was curious what would happen to him on the flight, if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.</seg>

		<seg id="0">John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that the US spying was &quot;inappropriate has gone too far&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission, softening the defensive attitude of the US in terms of its surveillance programs, saying that the espionage was &quot;inappropriate has gone too far in some cases.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The foreign minister also admitted that he bore the responsibility for the fact that you have switched on &quot;autopilot&quot; with Barack Obama, as the explosive revelations of the whistleblower, but Edward Snowden about the NSA spying activities were publicly.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The leaked information, the US government from its allies in a diplomatic uproar.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In a speech transmitted by video link on the open-government conference in London, Kerry said: &quot;there is no question, the President and I and others in the government of some of the things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to 9/11.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Then he confessed to the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US spying have crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;in some cases, it is unreasonable to have gone too far.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The President is determined to create clarity and, therefore, a thorough investigation so that no one should feel that the abuse took place.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I can assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good, and saved many lives through its surveillance operations.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: &quot;we are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow up themselves.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is a radical extremism in the world, the intent is to kill people attack to blow up and governments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, US lawmakers to travel to Europe, in order to dispel the doubts about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terror efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and be concerned about their threats to participate because of frustration over the surveillance by the National Security Agency to anti-terrorist organisations.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism remain on board,&quot; said Murphy, who is the first time in the Senate, as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on external relations and European affairs, in an interview in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Moreover, I am going to Europe, in order to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Media reports that the NSA collects millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the secret service announced this week that the reports were untrue and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Other revelations from cited passed on documents from Snowden that the NSA's phone was monitored by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other state leaders around the world.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that this was normal on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In all the tumult, said Murphy, his authority is preparing a tour of the Congress, which is due to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The names of the other participating members are to be published in the coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He said the exact itinerary will be worked out.</seg>
		<seg id="24">While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is to improve relations, he also said that there would be some &quot;serious words.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">He said that the European governments should their people to be honest about the type of spying programs that they themselves for years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;We can change our monitoring programmes and better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy,&quot; says Murphy.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Distant worlds.</seg>
		<seg id="4">More than 1000 planets in other stars, astronomers have already found.</seg>
		<seg id="5">If there is at least some of them life, nobody knows.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The selection is difficult: you should look for gravitational waves?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Or searching for Earth-like planets, and thus perhaps discovering alien life?</seg>
		<seg id="9">These questions are just the leaders of the European Space Agency (Esa.</seg>
		<seg id="10">They are looking for ideas for its program &quot;cosmic vision&quot; for two major space projects that will significantly advance the research.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The budget for such &quot;l missions&quot; is around one billion euros.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The start will be expected to 2028 and 2034.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At the beginning of September, met in Paris, the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">30 were ideas for debate, five of them have now been shortlisted.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Many bodies evaluate the proposals to push for the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the next few days, a final decision will fall through the scientific program committee.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A total of four major issues has selected the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated &quot;cosmic vision&quot; to find answers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?</seg>
		<seg id="19">The exact processes for the development of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit stars - they are still in the dark.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And when a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise?</seg>
		<seg id="22">In order to analyse this issue in 2017 to launch the space telescope &quot;Cheops,&quot; with the 500 already known planetary systems in our neighbourhood.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission, with a budget of EUR 150 million.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With larger instruments, astronomers could erdähnliche planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: gases, which are regarded as an indicator for biological activity.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How does the solar system?</seg>
		<seg id="26">Ultimately, this issue is to provide information about which there are conditions for the emergence of life.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particles of radiation emanating from him with the planetary system.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In our solar system, these processes can be an example.</seg>
		<seg id="29">With the &quot;solar Orbiter&quot; Esa already has a mission of the M-class (the budget is around half a billion euros) approved for this question.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The probe will start in 2017 and closely monitor the sun's surface and activity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They want to find out what the role of the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The Esa is the first of a total of three missions of the &quot;cosmic Vision&quot; program.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The probe &quot;juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey expected to 2022.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Eight years later, they reached Jupiter and examine the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymede.</seg>
		<seg id="36">What are the basic physical laws of the universe?</seg>
		<seg id="37">The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature we know there are still valid.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Maybe there are deviations, the physicists could point the way to a new theory that combine all known laws of nature.</seg>
		<seg id="39">How the universe is and what it is?</seg>
		<seg id="40">13.7 billion years ago, the cosmos was created by the Big Bang.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In addition to the usual matter to us, from the stars, planets and creatures like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, which is accelerating the expansion of the universe.</seg>
		<seg id="42">So far, the researchers do not know what the laws of physics in the first split second of ' Big Bang ' were valid, nor what is dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="43">With &quot;Euclid,&quot; the Esa has already granted a mission, whose launch is planned for 2020.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky and thus allow conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Who could make the race</seg>
		<seg id="46">Of the 30 proposals are only two left at the end of the selection process.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The best chances of approval as L-mission, according to many experts &quot;e-Lisa&quot;, a claim concept for the detection of gravitational waves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="49">They have not been proven to date.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Elisa could create the hope, the scientists behind the project.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The mission provides a detector for two or three existing probes, which will be stationed in space.</seg>
		<seg id="52">He could, in contrast to plants on Earth gravitational waves, which are in the Big Bang, and provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.</seg>
		<seg id="53">Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope named &quot;Athena&quot;, which will explore, among other things, black holes, &quot;icy planets,&quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism,&quot; a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder&quot; to detect and investigate the erdähnliche planet.</seg>

		<seg id="2">As the US customs authorities, more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a Belüftungs plant.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Three suspects were arrested, seized eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The tunnel was, according to the data has not yet been taken into use.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;These cartels are stupid if they think they could by digging under the radar,&quot; said the general state of US district of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in a warehouse in San Diego, where it was discovered at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At the drug gangs assured Duffy: &quot;if you continue to build this tunnel and tried to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a perpetual battle against the drug cartels.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since 2006, have been killed in Mexico, more than 77,000 people associated with drug-related crime.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Constructed by experts</seg>
		<seg id="10">Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators estimate that it was designed by architects and engineers and construction took about a year.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After intense criticism yesterday, President Obama backed down on his oft-repeated, clear promise: &quot;if you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter Kündigungs, Republicans threw the president in recent days that he had misled the American public.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yesterday, Obama watered down his original promise.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, they can,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who have received such messages, to look on the free market after a new insurance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Most citizens could get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or lower than predicted.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;They get a better offer,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The government called it a little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance, would have to look for another tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Parents of inter-sex children can choose &quot;sex&quot; undetermined</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Newborn is no longer rigidly assigned male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Under the new law, parents must declare no sex for such children, but can &quot;undecided&quot; or &quot;not&quot; on the birth certificate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so they have to make any hasty decisions regarding operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against inter-sexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A sexual person said, according to BBC years later: &quot;I am neither man nor woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I remain a patchwork quilt that was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Schätzungs, one of 2000 children each year, either as a boy or a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They belong to the sexual interaction, a group that fall under the diagnosis &quot;Sexualdifferenzierungsstörung&quot; (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson was perhaps more sexually.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S., you should use the best available information on gender assignment, if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide, if any, for an operation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law &quot;sound&quot; for a good cause.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Sexual interaction children an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but that does not apply to most children,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It could be a gender assignment without surgery and then wait and see how the identity is developing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity, are not very accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one knows why it happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it is claimed that inter-sexual people from Trans sexual or trans-gender people, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time, or not clear as one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics were bailed in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals or chromosome structure and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that inter-sexual and gender-Trans exposed persons in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and crime prejudice.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents, male or female &quot;third sex&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) as the world's first &quot;sex&quot; person, after a court had granted the long life of maintaining a &quot;undefined&quot; gender status.</seg>
		<seg id="24">German identity cards, in addition to M and W, in future, a third assignment, X for sexually, the Ministry of Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, signed dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country a petition that the &quot;gender theory&quot; should be removed from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law on the grounds that &quot;if the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist another two pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">The mother of a newborn in Maryland told baby zone, it would be better if babies at birth will be assigned a gender.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;The parents ' existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,&quot; she said the parents ' website.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and security.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children who were born with both male and female parts, as Hermaphroditen, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ten years ago, the medicine regarded sex as something that can be erased and then rebuild.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now doubted the ethical foundations of an operation, now know how complex is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child at the turn of the sex of their allocation.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot; The middle of the 20th century, we called this a &quot; psychiatric emergency ', &quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If such a child was born, then it is not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, argued that the sex was malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents of a child, educate beings interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and coined as to whether a person is a male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in a notorious case under the title &quot;John/Joan&quot; from 1966 his theories were controversial.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, castrated the child and to remove his testicles and then bring him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but he did not,&quot; says Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">With 38 but he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practice this model.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations to the public, who are not happy with the result. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a &quot;satisfactory&quot; life as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So external body and testicles shortly after birth were surgically removed in 1976, and he was brought up as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He received female hormones at the age of 12.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I am not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At the age of 18, he should receive a Vaginalplastik.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But, because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he found was shocking.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was at my birth – and no one has ever said.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After he had learned the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The operation has become infertile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today he is fighting for others in an organisation called Interface Project for more sexual people are perceived as normal.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, leader of the California-based law group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot; for stamping and encourage Stigmatisieren.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to give the child a ' not ',&quot; she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We fear that favours intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think it would be better to wait for the male or female sex and then.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we still do not know how the law will have an impact, so we can only speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law, &quot;because it allows adults recognition as a third sex.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law is about the allocation at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This is not a fight to force young children at this time.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologin from Pitts Burg, who has a daughter with a sexual Differenzierungs disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law &quot;authorize&quot; both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because of the Rezeptordefektes target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but not a uterus and no ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant in the child psychiatry.</seg>
		<seg id="74">It is barren, but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make decisions in haste,&quot; said Baratz.</seg>
		<seg id="76">It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this way, everything is in order – the child is large and loves it.</seg>
		<seg id="78">We have a wonderful baby and the parents of happiness.</seg>
		<seg id="79">And we must not rush to make an operation that will not undo.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that reconciles the parents because they believe that they would not do the right thing,&quot; she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Ultimately, the child decides on the sex, which fits better with him – and it is wonderful.</seg>
		<seg id="82">Children will be in a position to take the decision itself.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in the car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe the solution to be found in a small black box, the space in the dashboard of each car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, which are all mileage and the information to the authorities, heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the federal states to revise the outdated system of financing American roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The normally rather boring road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarian have allied with environmental groups and argue that the government of the small boxes to record mileage – and possibly, where they were – and then use the information for the calculation of modest tax.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Tea Party is appalled.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American civil rights association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and a series of data protection concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But while the Congress cannot agree on an approach that several federal states wait no longer.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are currently looking at how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, in which drivers pay per mile driven.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of drivers have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring, already tested.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This really is a must for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There is nothing that we may only be used,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, business leaders of the Southern California Assn. of government, which is planning a record of miles in all California motorists in the federal state in 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The way we pay these taxes will change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump is broke.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But in America is no longer fueled up as much as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars use less fuel.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not increased in 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians dare not at high gasoline prices to raise the tax by a penny.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gasoline tax is simply not capable of the future,&quot; says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His federal state has recently 500 cars equipped with recording a mileage-based payment system will be tested.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;The long term is the most sensible alternative,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Bureaucrats call it miles-based user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Not surprisingly, the idea is popular with urban liberals, because the tax could be example of ways to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions to be reduced.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies, in order to achieve the ambitious, statutory goals of the federal state on climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said that he is the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are amused by the idea of drivers to pay back chosen route.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole,&quot; says Adrian Moore, vice president for directives in Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People pay directly for what they get.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers, who had asked the Congress in a report in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The US Senate last year approved an expensive $90 million pilot project, which includes 10000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the thrust and responding to the concerns of Members from rural areas, the people who must often many miles on the way to work or to the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several federal states and cities are moving nichtsdestotrotz on their own in this direction.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most active is Oregon, which is currently being recruited by 5000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon pay the fees miles instead of the petroleum tax to the federal state.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="36">New York City also is considering.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois is testing it in limited with trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 federal states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently studying how to introduce the amendment.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and management at the transport ministry of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">People do not want it.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;it would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph in adult monitoring devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of a number of federal states, which are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
		<seg id="46">So, Khan, the public would also be comfortable.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The company is not originally set out to help federal states in the taxation of drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Rather, it was their goal, in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers pay on the basis of miles.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the tested devices are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which are regularly uploaded via modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People are more willing to participate if their speed and sites are not recorded,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, business manager of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Big mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programs.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon experiment the planners to give drivers a range of options.</seg>
		<seg id="55">You can opt for a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they choose any device and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the federal state.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with a smaller number who.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which also pay parking fees, insurance must be paid for driving distances and speed data in real time by other vehicles, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists would be motivated by the added value of the benefits that the system provides for participation,&quot; says a planning document of the city.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some traffic planners, however, are wondering whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge Ablenkungs maneuvers.</seg>
		<seg id="61">The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing the fuel tax.</seg>
		<seg id="62">An additional one-off fee, or an annual levy motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline will be imposed, so that they pay a fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no need for an operation, albeit an aspirin is sufficient,&quot; explains Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists about their privacy and many other things.</seg>

		<seg id="3">In a letter from Snowden, who on Friday from Stroebele presented to the media in Berlin, writes: &quot;even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to be a dissenting opinion as loyalty and tries to criminalise freedom of political expression with criminal threat, no defence.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">To tell the truth, however, is not a crime.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In the letter, Snowden writes that he was convinced that the support of the international community to persuade the American government could drop the charges against him.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration of peace.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want peace, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, leader of an investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">They fear for the future of the country has exchanged their clothing business against a T-shirt with the inscription &quot;we demand security&quot; in Portuguese, and on Thursday joined the crowd on the independence square of the capital.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement, more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the Apartheits South African government in a bid to destabilise the independent government of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It has become an opposition party after the peace treaty in 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts consider it unlikely that the country back into a full-scale conflict trap, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring into the country in the next few years, investments of more than $50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto and Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes by attacked on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops Renamo-bases attacked and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government gives Renamo the blame for the clashes and the organisation accused of attacking soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He told AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama himself as a &quot;loser&quot;, the &quot;all its remaining forces wants to prove that the government can impose its decisions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the FT that he had meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;Here we have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who heads collide,&quot; says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Renamos electoral successes shrink since 1992, while a new party, which was founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mazanga claimed that Guebuza – whose resignation, when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency,&quot; Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear what capacity Renamo, but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south links.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo in Beira, but use of the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio had announced a month for the use of the railways, after Renamo an attack on the track.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability have increased the frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media coop, an independent media company, because many people already were concerned about the corruption, the slow progress in the development and a recent wave of kidnapping.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar sultans, a protestor, said that people simply wanted stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Not interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Whenever it comes to the budget in council meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster, has a good laugh.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Gemeindesäckl in Wangen stove-Schönach is well stocked and debt already knows the administration since 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The 2012 budget can be booked as an unqualified success in this respect.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This was evident in the presentation of the annual bill for 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As Andrea Roth mouth explained, is the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million over a million euros higher than planned.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The surplus of the administrative budget is around one million euros over the approach, with about 1.8 million euros.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Thanks to the surplus mainly higher business tax revenues and the share of the income tax.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The household wealth again was significantly higher than the planned values.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Instead of the planned amounted to EUR 1.5 million in the last year of EUR 2.5 million.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;This is due largely to the higher allocation from the administrative budget,&quot; says Roth.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As fewer investments have been made as planned in the 2012 budget, is also the supply of reserves.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Overall, the general reserve could be increased by about 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Mayor Ralph Gerster, thanked Roth and her team for their excellent work.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;A work not just shakes&quot; from the sleeve, praised Gerster, with a view to the year.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He and the local councils rejoiced visibly on the good figures.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers could soon be citizens dearly.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The good financial position, the community could forgo high rates in the past.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This, in turn, but several times, according to Gerster, subsidies have been cut from the country.</seg>
		<seg id="19">There are conditions for these grants from various compensation.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Among other things, the cities and towns to apply for the grants, certain rates.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;The issue of lifting rates, we have to look at, because in the coming years, investment, for which we would like to support,&quot; Gerster, announced in this context.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Verzweiflungs cry of an Obama voter</seg>
		<seg id="1">I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says that Obama has lobens values, efforts have been frustrated by the blocking tactics by Republicans</seg>
		<seg id="3">The blockade policy does not condone the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes</seg>
		<seg id="4">Obama's memoir about the 2008 election campaign, a sad reminder of what would have been possible</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I read a terribly sad book.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a book that I thought I would be cheering up during the sad second year of my medical degree and give me hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;the Audacity to Win&quot; (courage) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential election.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I am finished the evening with my patients and go to bed, then the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches were breathtaking.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election was held to a landslide victory and newsreaders, the historical significance of this hour.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Then in 2008, Obama moved into office, he had approval voting values of 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if it is ripped from a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years since I have for the first time, really has changed somewhat.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But there is simply nothing that I imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I also believe that the political party blocking tactics have too many efforts, with whom our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after I have defended countless times, the Obama administration with colleagues and acquaintances, I have reached the end of my trying to enlighten.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I have reached a point of political desperation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Republican obstructionism cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers should be punished, disclose wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki was an American citizen State, was murdered without trial, which is why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It does not justify the findings of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media are the &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And most recent cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know if that is what I have expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If I had to understand that the government work could contradict their previous political campaigns with 18.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Apparently, the Abgeordnetenamt no predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And that bothers me most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I was re-elected in 2012, Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not his direction and positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes we had for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But with the drop in approval voting values for Obama to below 45% this week to return to 2008 is even tougher in this book.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It gives me the longing for the many promises that have evaporated.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama has had a severe loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In a meeting with the election officials after the decision, he told his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want us to find our magic,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We need to remember who we are.</seg>
		<seg id="42">There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>
