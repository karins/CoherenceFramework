		<seg id="0">The power engineers Dnepropetrovqiny began the unique program of rescue... the nests of the storks</seg>
		<seg id="1">Into antiquity, in order to train to the yard of the storks, the peasants were installing the wheel from the wooden handcart on the high pole, and well it was held up by the heavy nest.</seg>
		<seg id="2">They are not standing such special supports up for a long time already, therefore the storks chose the poles of the lines of power transmission - the braided branches are leaning against the cables, thanks to that the aistinyij house is reliably.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The grandmother Anya directly by whose house in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovskogo of the district twenty years aistinaya family has already lived started noting how the nest settles, despite all efforts of his inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The birds are putting new vetochki from above, and the lower layer has already settled among the send-offs, will collapse any moment.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It is final, family of the storks which nested near the town house every year, took and suckled three to four chicks in the summer is pitiful, however, it to remain without light is not desirable.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As soon as the birds flew away into the warm edges, the grandmother Anya called in Carichanskiij REhS who a support belongs to.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I/you/she did even not expect that there they will react so fast either.</seg>
		<seg id="8">After our specialists came in Ivanovku, they were surprised that, in general still, the nest is maintained: the technical director DTEhK &quot;Dneprooblehnergo&quot; Sergei Berezovsky said.</seg>
		<seg id="9">On the cables which, in essence, turned up the corrosion has already inside the nest which weighs 150 - 200 kilograms begun.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Every time the birds could die of electric class.</seg>
		<seg id="11">What is more the local inhabitants risked remaining without a light due to the damage of send-offs.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Therefore the linemen began the operation on the rescue of the nest, and already not for the first time in our practice.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Scientists-ornithologist from the national Dnepropetrovsk university helped who worked the scheme of the transfer of the nest out.</seg>
		<seg id="14">After all they conducted the trainings for the co-workers of the district nets.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The well known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko has advised power engineers on all the stages of the reconstruction of the nests.</seg>
		<seg id="16">For beginning they calculated that in the field in the emergency state more than 50 aistinyx &quot;apartments&quot; are located.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The special metallic platforms which are reminiscent of a funnel were cooked for their reconstruction.</seg>
		<seg id="18">They braided the basis with the ivovymi branches, and then they carried the old nest there.</seg>
		<seg id="19">You have to put the old branches in it according to the experts, sufficiently as basis, that the birds recognized the nest and they returned.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Already then the storks themselves will be finishing will build their dwelling.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In the village of Peschanka Novomoskovskogo of the district the first nest was reconstructed a month ago.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Next to the electrosupport put the new reinforced concrete pole and they put the platform with the nest old, had settled already in it</seg>
		<seg id="23">The whole operation cost the power engineers nine thousand grivnas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And the other day the same new home took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovskogo of the district on the town house of the grandmother Ani.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Here they secured the platform in the former place, lifted up only above the send-offs.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The ornithologists are convinced, what will not note the careful, conservative birds even with the spring, that their &quot;apartment&quot; was exposed to the complete overhaul.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Until the turn of the year the same reconstruction expects another four nests in Pokrovskom also Carichanskom the districts Dnepropetrovqiny.</seg>
		<seg id="28">By the way, one have saved the rare birds yet, the other ones kill them ruthlessly.</seg>

		<seg id="30">The noble birds were not afraid of the people at all - their local inhabitants were feeding and they were not offending.</seg>
		<seg id="31">When the villagers ran to the pond after hearing the shots, four attractive young men-swan have already lain dead on water.</seg>

		<seg id="16">Airbus says that I/you/she ordered the research which examines that an additional inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of the dream by 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing is contesting the numbers Airbus in sizes of the seats and says that it is not it to the producers worth to meddle in the decisions about that, as airlines to find balance among the tariffs and comforts</seg>

		<seg id="4">For two weeks the daily messages about the clashes among governmental troops and Renamo have practically been received — this is greater one of the cruelest skirmishes since the time of the conclusion of truce 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once the well known rebel movement which was being kept up by the white authorities of Rhodesia at first, but then the government of South Africa of the epoch of the apartheid within the framework of efforts in destabilization of the independent government of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After the truce of 1992 it became the opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The analysts think that the country will roll down to a full scale conflict scarcely again, however the recent events forced foreign investors and local inhabitants to be nervous.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The rates are high for the rapidly growing economy, in so far as the opening of the huge shelf reserves of gas and coal deposits in the northwest can draw more $ 50 billion as capital investments at the age of a few next years from such companies as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brasilia Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling Фрелимо party, the political leading power since 1975, and the party Renamo are accusing each other of the tension which was created.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The party Renamo asserts that the government became the instigator of the last clashes after attacking her members in the province Sofala, the traditional stronghold Renamo, on 17th October.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The attacks on the former rebels became more acute then after the governmental troops attacked the bases Renamo and had tried to kill Afonso Dxlakamu — the leader of a group, I/you/he informed newspaper Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative Renamo.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government is accusing Renamo of the initiation of clashes accusing the party of the attack on the soldiers.</seg>

		<seg id="22">The party Renamo which is trying to achieve the electoral reforms has already reported that she will boycott the municipal elections nominated for November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the next year.</seg>

		<seg id="27">«He does not want multipart democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want a peace because he does not want to abandon the president's post» said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear what possibilities Renamo possesses, however she has already carried out the destructive and precipitant attacks on the police stations and the cars are on the key highway that is leading from the north to the south.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The majority of skirmishes took place in the province Sofala which is located in a little hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beijru — port, which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use in order to export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June Rio stopped the use of railway roads to approximately a week after Renamo had threatened by the attack on the railway.</seg>

		<seg id="32">The party Renamo wanted «to give advance notice to the international association of the things not being going on in Mozambique not really well», said Mazanga.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The scientists spilled light on that, as the movements of the dog's tail are connected to her mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">The earlier researches showed that the content dogs are wagging the tail into the right hand side (from the point of view of the dog) while the worried dogs are waving with the tail primarily into left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now the scientists are speaking, that the other representatives of the family can note the ones dog also to react to them these delicate distinctions in wagging by the tail.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Dzhordzhio Vallortigara, the neurobiologist from the Trentskogo university, is speaking: «Which they participate with the people of the left and right side of the brain differently in the formation of pobuditeleij which cause positive or negative emotions is well known».</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we tried to look on this and near some other looks</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that the right part of the brain is checking the left side of the body just as as with the person, at the dogs and conversely, also two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In order to know more about that, like the dogs wagging of other dogs' tails react to the many-sided ones, the researchers observed behind the animals when they were watching the films about other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the frequency of the palpitation of the animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Probably, we will understand already soon why their tails go to one side sometimes, and are sometimes into another</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: «We showed to the dogs of the video with the dogs is either naturalistic versions or silhouette, that they could get rid of just any another deforming factor, and we manipulate the movement of the tail also to direct the tail to the left or to the right more».</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals saw that the dog not expressing anything in the remaining one moved its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that is wagging its tail) they remained weakened absolutely.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they were noting, that the tail was tending primarily to the left (again from the point of view of the dog that is wagging its tail), their palpitation became more frequent and they looked worried.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that the dogs intentionally associated with each other with the help of these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">As a matter of fact he thinks that the dogs knew about what movements should worry them, and about what is not no from their experience</seg>
		<seg id="14">He is noting: «If a few meetings with other dogs are going on also often is connected wagging of their tail to one side «with a friendlier behavior, but the right hand side gives a less friendly behavior, the dog reacts according to this experience</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that these results can give the owners, the veterinarians and the ringmasters the deeper understanding of the emotions of their animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Is an expert in the field of the behavior of the dogs the John Brehdwou, the scientific invited co-worker is in the veterinary school Bristoljskogo of university said, that this was not the first research for the that check, they really have the importance for the dogs of the left and right side.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year the group of the scientists from Lincoln's university discovered that the dogs are turning their heads to the left if they look on the aggressive dog, and to the right, if they look at the content dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another scientific work of Victoria's university in Canada he was announcing: «The dogs approached the dog robot more often, when wagging of her tail «went to the left, but not to the right, instead of becoming worried, the opposite behavior is with respect to an Italian research».</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said that distinctions could be due to that which the dogs did not perceive in different researches completely the animals in films or the dogs robot as the dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A research of the that could be effective as the dogs react to the real dogs, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">«While it exists sufficiently on different mammals the evidences of two lobes of cerebrum being used for some different goals many components still does not lie ahead to specify, also the dogs exception is said it</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, taking into consideration that facility from which their behavior can be registered probably, we will already soon understand why their tails go to one side sometimes, and are sometimes into another.</seg>

		<seg id="6">They want so that the government would give priority to new trade relations with such countries as China, India and Brasilia but did not waste the time for the long and difficult process of the reform of the tangled institutes of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When they were asking them about their looks on concrete political questions, from the anti-monopolistic control before laws on the production, majority is business-they counted the leaders that the control of these key spheres should be returned to responsibility by Vestminsteru.</seg>

		<seg id="10">This result which was observed among the businesses of all the sizes and biggest biznes-grupp shows what is drawing the business on «the important change» which will bring back a power to Great Britain back.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The rates are high — the achievement of the changes in agreement and more profitable conditions for Great Britain will provide the 16-percent shift in vote behind staying in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The prime minister does not have to have no doubts: this polling shows that the British business maintains his plan of the revision of the conditions of the membership of Great Britain in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that he is expecting the business, that it will lead the revision to the considerable shift in the current balance of the forces back in the direction of Great Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The better conditions for British business are possible and are becoming always more necessary enters according to that, how evrozona on the path of the narrower economic and financial association.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Priority has to be felt the jobs and the economic growth in Great Britain, and as they show the results of our polling for a business this means the strengthened concentration of the attention on commerce and the fundamental changes in the normative activity of Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The full refusal of the animal products is harmful.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The animal whites contain the indispensable amino acids, which it is really complicated to compensate for vegetable.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is necessary to include the ration at least in milk or the eggs certainly&quot;, nutritionist Marina Bogaij is convinced.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is citing the fish which contains indispensable fatty acid Omega-3 as an example.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The vegetable oil, richest in it is flax.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;In order to use it in the quantities that are necessary for the person, it is necessary to drink the liters&quot;! - a nutritionist is speaking.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The physicians are convinced that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay a particular attention to the ration in the winter.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Vegetarianism is being put especially in this season under doubt.</seg>
		<seg id="15">With regard to our real facts the high demands are being made on the food</seg>
		<seg id="16">In order to not freeze, a greater calorie content is necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;If the person is limiting himself on the animal products, correspondingly, he is not getting enough of this calorie content&quot;, is saying a specialist.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Doctor-nutritionist Olga Poznyak is agreeing with this.</seg>

		<seg id="20">It is better for the person to live primarily on the products which are raised in the region of living or there, where it was born.</seg>

		<seg id="28">The doctors note that veganstvo is especially harmful for the children and the pregnant women.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The children are growing, they need building material, among them in the form of the amino acids.</seg>

		<seg id="43">&quot;The apples are not becoming brown on the section, the cucumbers turn yellow fast and grow, the tomatoes are tasteless and unaromatic&quot;: a physician is listing examples adding that they are stuffed by the excessive quantity of fertilizers, most probably.</seg>

		<seg id="2">As a rule, the talk was either about their reorganization and widening of highways or about the attempts to reduce the demand for automobile trips, the quantity of the cars and the time their uses.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Widely the example of Singapore where the hard quotation of the increase of the number of private cars is brought, and the right of their acquisition is being bought on the auctions is well known.</seg>
		<seg id="4">His price can exceed the price of the car itself by two to three times.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The European towns, including London, introduced the charge for the entry into the downtown.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, they are bringing the so-called green zones, where the entry is allowed only the cars with certain ehkoklassom also using the fuel of quality (including biofuel or the electric vehicles).</seg>
		<seg id="7">The agency of the environmental protection of Beijing, for example, reconfirmed in 2012 &quot;the quinquennial plan of the pure air&quot; the total value about 250 billion yuans (close to $ 40 billion).</seg>
		<seg id="8">As &quot;H&quot; said the director of the department of the control of transport soiling of municipal office of environmental protection of Beijing Li Kunweng, the main aim of five-year plan is a reduction of the leading pollutants of air of 20-35% by 2017, a growth of the quantity not exceeding the private cars to level 6 million (now 5.2 млн), as well as the increase by at most 5% of the use of the fuel with regard to one means of transport.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the data of the agency, the road traffic is responsible in Beijing for 22.5% of a common air pollution now.</seg>
		<seg id="10">There are a restriction of the use of the automobile transport, as well as an introduction of additional taxes for the car owners among the main measures of the program.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Apart from other, city measures &quot;green they include &quot;the five-year plans&quot; quickened in comparison with remaining the country the transition to evrostandarty the fuels, introduction local the systems of ehkostandartov and the markings of the cars and fuel, restriction to the entry of the cars into the inner city, ban on use the means of transport which became obsolete (moreover the creation promotional financial the programs of the replacement old the cars on hybrid or the electric vehicles), the development of the electric means of transportation (public among them and auxiliary the development of public transport (the one high-speed among them).</seg>

		<seg id="13">According to the current state program &quot;Environmental protection by 2012-2020&quot;, the quantity of the towns with high and very high air pollution has to decrease to 128 (in 2012 them was 138).</seg>

		<seg id="15">In Moscow, for example, the industrial ones exceed the ejections from the cars ten times as much, and there is in St Petersburg nine times as much.</seg>
		<seg id="16">IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION they begin to be only thoughtful about the possibilities of the restrictive control of the cars in the streets of the towns yet.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The director of the Institute is counting the economies of transport and transport policy VWEh Michael Blinkin, that the administrative and fiscal measures directed towards the suppression of the demand for automobile trips are matter wittingly unpopular, they can be received by the society only on condition of their most complete universality.</seg>

		<seg id="20">The researchers' main withdrawals: the downtown is provided by the roads twice less being demanded, and the majority of the motorists that live in the center cars do not use every day, leaving them on for a long time on the parkings or simply in the streets.</seg>
		<seg id="21">As a result it is being offered to build not parkings, but the storehouses of the cars, not to enlarge, but to reduce the lane (in order to the streets became friendlier for the pedestrians), as well as to limit a use and the allocation of the personal transport in the boundaries of the territory of the protection zone of historic center (the common territory about 3212 hectares covering the row of the central districts the towns).</seg>

		<seg id="8">&quot;I did not meet any one in Russian law-enforcement agencies or already anywhere, who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization&quot;, is an American Center on the research of corruption and the organized crime is quoting Mr Galeotti.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Goldman Sachs gave advance notice of risks for the Russian economy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs gave advance notice of the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - the consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This above all the crisis of the nonpayments according to unsupported consumer credit and the workers' mass reductions.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Our main anxiety now is not that the growth became slower, but rather, the structure of this growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Recently it is completely stipulated by the consumption which does almost not reduce the revolutions&quot;, declared the head economist Goldman Sachs on Russia Klemens the Column presenting the quarterly report of investbanka on the Russian economy yesterday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Soon there is nominal growth of the wages about 10% in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="6">On inflation of 6% it will be able to provide the future consumer demand approximately at the current level, are expecting in Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But the profitability of the Russian companies falls, therefore, most probably, they will begin the optimization of the expenses for personnel.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Today we see the essential growth of the share of the wages in the GDP: I/you/he explained, if the wages grow of 10%, the GDP is only of 2%, Mr the Column.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The companies encountered the reduction of profitability.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If it will not grow, this can lead to some dismissals and the growth of unemployment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Wages are not able to raise a Russian business, the head economist of Barclays Capital on Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyuwin is commenting.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Unemployment is close to the historic minimums, competition for the workers is high.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In order to entice the attentive co-workers or to retain the present ones, the employers have to pick up the wages.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The consumption in Russia podder­zhivaetsya also with the very fast growth of potrebkreditovaniya.</seg>
		<seg id="15">On opinion g-on the Graph, due to extremely high stakes on the consumer loans of the muljtiplikativnogo effect on the economy of the country this type of crediting not provides.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;We did not see the benefit for the economy from the growth of potrebkreditovaniya as any, the money is not varying on the economy, and are returning to the same banks in the form of the interest-bearing payments&quot;, said an economist.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But problem is into the friend in Goldman Sachs they are expecting the growth of delay according to uncovered credits.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Mainly scanty people are taking them, which there is nothing to grant into support.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The interests on such loans are high.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Like consequence they&quot; are not &quot;returning&quot; them to the thicket noted, Mr the Column.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Therefore there is the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia the possible crisis of the nonpayments according to uncovered credits.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The director of the Bank institute VWEh Basil Solodkov sees the signs of the ripening bank crisis already now.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Small credit institutions, without having the access to the cheap resources, what the state banks have, the resources had to attract the populations just before the high interests.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Into answer the state banks came out to the path of war and they started reducing credit rates: an economist continues.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The small credit institutions are not able to issue the loans at the same interests, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If the state banks will not refuse a dumping, full-fledged bank crisis is for Russia in store, thinks Basil Solodkov.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The economist considers the deprivation of the licenses of the row of banks to be a herald of the mass crash in the last weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Themselves the state banks will not manage such a situation: the system of the insurance of deposits was originally not calculated for a system crisis&quot;, is giving the head of the institute advance notice.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But the growth of consumption will become slower also without crisis of nonpayments, they think in investbanke is, due to the refusal of the indexing of the wages of the civil servants and the soldiers, be laid in the current version of the budget estimates.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The blow to consumption will partially be softened by the zamorozkoij of tariffs of natural monopolies (and as consequence the reduction of inflation).</seg>
		<seg id="31">But only partially: anyway, if the capital investments will not grow (and the prerequisites to this have not been here yet - watch the information), the growth of consumption will become slower, is assured of Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Vladimir Pantyuwin has not seen the prerequisites to the realization of the pessimistic scenarios of Barclays Capital yet.</seg>
		<seg id="33">&quot;The main risk has been a slump in price of mineral oil as before&quot;, he is saying.</seg>
		<seg id="34">According to his estimate, the economy of Russia will begin to decrease at the cost of the mineral oil beneath 90 $ /barrel.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Goldman Sachs they also noted what not to reduce the central bank in some forces interest rates in the economy yet.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The paradoxical picture is being watched: the inflation came down, and the banks started picking up rates.</seg>
		<seg id="37">This can mean that they did not confide to the central bank which declared the transition to targetirovaniyu of inflation&quot; told Klemens the Column.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The interest policy of the central bank does not influence some market rates, influences only the rates of the interbank crediting.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;For the central bank this is a crash of all the hopes&quot;, is appraised Klemens the Column.</seg>
		<seg id="40">They are using the money, the central banks which were received on the auctions, the banks not for the granting of credit of the economy, but for a department of their liquidity</seg>
		<seg id="41">As soon as the rate is coming down, exchange rate is changing immediately, this means, what try resources to go on speculations against the rouble.</seg>
		<seg id="42">I/you/he said &quot;sooner or later the central bank will understand that this strategy&quot; does not &quot;work&quot; Mr the Column and I/you/he reminded, on that letting go the rouble into &quot;a free cruise the state plans towards the end of 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But one will have to do either this earlier, or to pick up the key rate of the central bank (5.5%), he thinks.</seg>
		<seg id="44">According to his estimate, the exchange rate of the rouble is artificially set too high by 10% now.</seg>
		<seg id="45">I chop only one expensive - to weaken, - an expert is coming to conclusion.</seg>
		<seg id="46">But if the central bank will shed in the financial expert the shade of the doubt about the liquidation of the exchange corridor not being not the part of the policy for the purpose of the weakening of the rouble at least this much more strongly can demolish the rouble.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAU: «The air passengers can use gadzhety by planes (but it is not allowed to call from the car telephone) now»</seg>
		<seg id="1">The passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the whole flight, смогут to work in order to read, смогут to play games, смогут to watch films and смогут to listen to music, but not to speak the car telephones , — according to the long-awaited new directors the principles published by the Federal aircraft department on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But the passengers do not have to expect that the changes will occur immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">As such a change is realized fast, it will vary depending on airline, said administrator FAU Michael Uehrta on press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The airlines will have to show FAU as their planes correspond to new guiding principles both that are renewing their teaching aids for members of flying crew and governed on the packing of the devices, in order to correspond to new guiding principles.</seg>
		<seg id="5">FAU declared that it has already received the plans from some airlines of the expansion of the use of the portable electronic devices in the planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines which have already presented the plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">«Depending on the state of the plan we could very soon have approved the expansion of the use of the electronic devices», declared FAU.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At present the passengers are obliged to cut off their smartfony, the map cases and other devices as soon as the door of the plane is closing.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They do not have to perezapuskatj them while the plane will not be reaching the height with 10 000 feet and the captain will not be giving «good».</seg>
		<seg id="10">The passengers have to turn off their devices again, when the plane is coming down for landing, and do not to include them while the plane will not be turning up on earth</seg>
		<seg id="11">In accordance with new guiding principles, the airlines whose planes are properly defended against electronic disturbances can let the passengers use these devices during take-off, landing and the steering, FAU declared.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The majorities of the new airliners and other planes modified in this way correspond to these criteria that the passengers could employ Wi-Fi at big heights as he is being expected.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Gleijding, the president of the Association of the professional stewards, I/you/she welcomed these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">«After the new policy will be realized successfully (and we are preparing to work in narrow contact with the ferryman in order to achieve this), this will be a safe version», Gleijding declared.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We got openly tired of feeling «like persons on duty on the school» when it is coming to this question.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But web access for the surfing, the exchange of the E-Mails, text messages or the download of the ones given anyway will be prohibited from at a height less than 10 000 feet, announced an agency.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It will be offered for the passengers into the regime of the plane to switch his smartfony, the map cases and other devices.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In this way, as before any «words with the friends» is intellectual internet game, into which the actor Alek played Baldwin on his smartfone in 2011, after the nawumevwiij case occurred: the actor was taken off the plane of the airline American Airlines for the rejection to turn off the device at that time, when the plane was near an exit to landing.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And it will be necessary as before to put the heavier devices such as the notebooks, in the luggage compartment in so far as they can traumatize anybody if they will fly on the whole parlor.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The bells from the car telephone are also in the flight will be as before are prohibited.</seg>
		<seg id="21">A regulating power in the telephone bells belongs to Federal connection commission, and not FAU.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAU can remove the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landings</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month Mark is Rozenker from National counsel on security of the transport, a national security of the transportations CBS News expert, declared that the cellular telephones have been considered risk as before.</seg>
		<seg id="24">«The cellular telephones are valid problem, not only because they can potentially create the disturbances for the navigation devices, but we know thanks to FKS that they can create the disturbances for the towers of honeycomb connection when the plane is in air» Rozenker said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The branch advisory committee created by FAU for the research of this question recommended that the government resolved the wider use of the personal electronic devices last month.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In the last years the pressure on FAU with the aim of the weakening of the restrictions to their use increased.</seg>
		<seg id="27">They are asserting, the critics as the democrat-senator are from the staff of Missouri Klehr Makkaskil, what for bans no important reason connected to security is not.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The observance of restrictions is also beginning more and more complicatedly to provide because the application of the devices became general.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some researches show that up to third of the passengers forget or up to third of the passengers ignore the instructions to turn off its devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">FAU began to limit the use as passengers of the electronic devices in 1966 in reply to messages about disturbances for the one navigation and the communication equipment when the passengers began to take the FM receiving sets with themselves — high technology gadzhety of that time.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The new airliners are much more более зависимыми from electric systems than the previous generations of the planes, but they are also being developed and FAU is being confirmed as resistant to electronic disturbances.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airlines have been offering the passengers the use Wi-Fi in the cruised height already for a few years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The planes modified for Wi-Fi-sistem are also more resistant to disturbances.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The overwhelming majority of the liners is adapted for the wider use of the electronic devices according to new guiding principles, said Uehrta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The today's electronic devices are normally radiating the radio signals of the much lower power than the previous generations of the devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The devices of the reading of the e-books, for example, are radiating only the minimum signals on leafing of pages.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the signals are becoming more powerful when the devices are downloading or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">There was a company Amazon.com among those who attempted the softening of the restrictions to the use by the passengers of the electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011 the representatives of the company loaded the intact airliner with their devices of the reading of the e-books Kindle and they flew in it in order to check the presence of the problems, but tak i ne they did not discover them.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The members of advisory committee FAU expressed mixed feelings concerning whether an application of the devices presenting some risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Duglas Kidd declared the passengers from National association, which has considered disturbances real from the devices even if risk is minimum.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other members of the committee said that there are only separate messages of the pilots confirming what the devices can create the disturbances for aircraft systems, and most of these messages the very old ones.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Nevertheless the committee recommended that FAU let the pilots demand of the passengers to cut off the devices during landings on the instruments with regard to the limited visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The group of the representatives of the tourist industry welcomed these changes calling them the sensible step towards the passengers who now are using the mass of the technological devices.</seg>
		<seg id="45">«We are happy about FAU recognizing that the passengers' comfort is not incompatible with security and defense», said Rodzher Dou, the General Manager of the Tourist association of the USA.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The scientists worked out anti-nicotinic vaccine which could have deprived the process of smoking of the cigarettes of pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One dose of vaccine has managed to protect the mice from nicotinic dependence on the whole life.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests are necessary until the beginning of the tests on the people, that a few years will be needed for, but professor Ronaljd declared the Crystal from the medical college Uehijll Kornell in New York, which the first results assure.</seg>
		<seg id="4">«We hope that such a strategy of the application of vaccine can help, at last, millions of the smokers which tried to quit after checking all the methods that are available in the market today really, but discovered, what their nicotinic dependence sufficiently strong in order to overcome it with the help of these modern resources» professor Kornell said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">New vaccine contains the harmless virus which was worked out so that to support the genetic information for the production of the anti-nicotinic antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus infects izbirateljno the cells of the liver which then begin to make the stable stream of the antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They are tracking down the antibodies just any molecule of nicotine in blood neutralizing them before they are reaching their brain averting the receipt by the smoker of the nicotinic blow.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The mice in tests vakcinirovannye to which they subsequently gave nicotine continued their normal activity.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And the mice to which they did not give vaccine «were being weakened», and this is a sign that nicotine reached to their brain, are saying researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">These experiments are described in magazine Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained the antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It was so often necessary in order to keep the high level of the antibodies to do the injections that they turned out to be dear and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine, probably, will be much lower because it is turning the cells of the liver into antibody factories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The professor said the Crystal, what if vaccine that is human was completely safe, the children could be allowed to give it averting the nicotinic dependence before with them the wish to test the cigarette will appear.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more probably that it will be employed to quit smoking by the smokers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">«They will know, what if they began to smoke again, they will not receive from this pleasure due to nicotinic vaccine, and this can help them to get rid of this habit», said it</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines is planning on collecting 100 $ from the passengers for their being carrying hand luggage on the board of his flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines is planning on beginning to impose up to 100 $ on coffee or gazirovku behind the hand luggage and $ 2 although their announcement said on Wednesday that the passengers will be able to leave themselves the whole can.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new charge for the hand luggage is concerning the bags in the top baggage compartments, therefore the small bags which are put under the seat will remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier told that he will impose 25 $ also to 100 $ if the collection is being paid for beforehand after if the traveling ones will pay only turning up near an exit to landing.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The representative Kate O'Mehlli Frontier said that the pay has to force of 100 $ the passengers to take care of the payment beforehand.</seg>
		<seg id="6">«We do not want to impose the pay on this», she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The airlines began to impose the charge for the first and the second bag which is handed in to the luggage, in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The passengers that are trying to avoid these collections are paving so many, how much will be able, into the hand luggage due to what in these compartments being put in the top baggage compartments does not suffice place often.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The collections are one of the ways to force the passengers it to carry less on the board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'Mehlli said, what this new collection as a matter of fact not for the sake of earning of money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The thing is that the most loyal clients Frontier are declaring, what to find place in the top baggage compartments is becoming all more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The passengers will not have to pay who are buying the tickets on the site of the airline.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that one passenger in line can have near exit to the flight Frontier the opportunity one to carry the bag freely while the following passenger 100 $ can pay at lines for the same bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'Mehlli said that the change of procedures is called upon on the web site and near the counters of the registration Frontier to guarantee that the passengers will know about a collection before they are winding up to an exit to landing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The new collection Frontier for the hand luggage will not begin to be imposed until the summer although the date is not fixed yet.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often complain about a charge for the luggage and some other collections, but the airlines are adoring them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They assert that the processing of the luggage costs the money, and the passengers who need this service have to pay for it</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many people consider the addition of baggage collections to be the sign of the airlines imposing sufficiently the money in order to cover the expenditures on aviaperelety after a few years of damages on Uoll-strit.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However most of them did not concern the collections for the hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. I/you/she brought the first collection for the hand luggage three years ago, and I/you/he yet another diskaunter Allegiant Air later followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Hungarian Wizz Air is another only airline with such a collection, the consultant on the airlines of Dzheij Sorensen who is attentively registering the additional collections said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">According to his estimate in report from December 2011, the collection for the hand luggage brings Spirit of $ 50 million in a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, the former top-manager Midwest Airlines, flew in the flight Spirit recently, and it was interesting for him what he will discover near an exit to landing after the passengers will encounter an unusual collection Spirit for the hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="24">«The process of landing was the smoothest of those, which I saw for my career in airlines», he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see the gnashing of the teeth and the beginnings of the fight near exit to landing.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he said, «also the landing turned out precipitantly».</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also follows Spirit with regard to the pay of $ of 2 behind coffee, tea, gazirovku or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier declared what can leave themselves the passengers who are receiving gazirovku or juice the whole can and that will be granted the topping of coffee freely.</seg>
		<seg id="29">She will distribute freely water as before.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways tried to impose the pay on the drinks in 2008 the brief time, but refused this in seven months after the passengers began to complain and no another big airline followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The initiative Frontier on the collection of the charge for the hand luggage when the passengers are not buying tickets directly from airline is her last measure concerning soliciting new business on its web site</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airlines are paying to the onlaijn-sellers of the tickets as Orbitz, from 10 $ up to 25 $ behind every sold ticket.</seg>
		<seg id="33">This let all the airlines encourage the passengers stimulus to buy the tickets from them outright, and it is not allowed to turn to a tourist onlaijn agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">However Frontier went furthest in this field</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September it began to give the clients who bought the tickets across online tourist agency twice few bonus миль of the often flying passenger.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday it cut off the bonus number of the miles up to 25 percent from the miles of trip.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So, the trip of 1000 miles has been from Frontier, acquired at online tourist agency, would have allowed receiving 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Moreover, the passengers may choose the place beforehand provided that they are buying the tickets directly on the site Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier has a base of the loyal clients in her Denver home town, but her business is decreasing and it is becoming unprofitable.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The gain was reduced by 9 percent, and the flying possibilities decreased by hardly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by the parental company Republic Airways Holdings Inc on Wednesday.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic is trying to adjust the finances Frontier within the framework of the sale to airline.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European country which recognized the third floor with the children given birth to with the outward sex organs of the intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="2">They will any more attribute a man or female floor to the neonates certainly.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new law is not requiring of the parents to call such children's floor some allowing the parents to indicate the floor as «indefinite» or «unstated» one in their evidences about the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Was the goal of the law to take a pressure off the parents who can make the hurried decisions about the operation on conferring of floor on the neonates, and to counteract the discrimination of the interseksualjnyx people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One interseksualjnyij person said, according to BBC, many years later: «I am not a man and not the woman».</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain a patchwork product created by the doctors with the bruises and scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Approximately one of two thousand children that are born annually it is neither a boy, nor a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They have an intersexuality, one of approximately 60 pathological states which hit under the diagnosis of «the violation of the sexual development» — collective term for the people with the atipichnymi chromosomes, the gonads (the ovaries or semennikami) or the unusual outward developing sex organs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Uollis Simpson was interseksualom, possibly.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The gender identification is studied up to now insufficiently, however the majorities of the experts are speaking to the USA, that if the floor can not be determined it is better to take advantage of the whole available information and to appropriate it than to wait and to register the child's psychological and physical development before the carrying out of operation, if, in general, this will occur.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist, doctor Dzhek the Thresher who is specializing in problems of the gender identification said that the new German law «sounds like a good idea».</seg>
		<seg id="12">The children are creating ethical dilemma for Interseksualjnye.</seg>
		<seg id="13">«Some people have violations which are requiring a functional intrusion threatening lives, the majority of the children does however not have them», he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can appropriate the floor without operation and then look as personality is developing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science about how the child will develop some gender identity is not too precise.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one can answer the questions about why this occurs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">This like the riddle about why the people are homosexual sometimes.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Or transgendernyx, in so far as their state has relationship I do not genderu to the report sent to a European commission in 2011 describes the interseksualjnyx people as those different from the transsexual ones, but to their biological building which does not correspond exceptionally to neither man, nor female floor, and is typically not characteristic of both either simultaneously not for one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics can be seen in second sexual such as muscular mass, the allocation of the hair cover, the breast and the build signs; primary sexual signs, such signs as reproductive organs and genitalii, or in the structure of the chromosomes and the hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives the concept about discrimination, from which they have been coming across interseksualjnye and transgendernye the people in the sphere of employment, as well as about the level of pritesneniij, cruelty and crimes on the ground of prejudices.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The boys with the gender deviations have a special camp now.</seg>

		<seg id="27">The American web site Catholic Online also expressed the disagreement with German law after writing what «in the situation when the peace is getting used to a new state, where the floor is the object of choice, and the sexual activity is not no, we are turning» still two pillars of civilization over.</seg>
		<seg id="28">One mother of the newborn child also announced web from Maryland-the site Baby Zone that she would have preferred so that the children established floor on the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">«Raising a child is enough seriously and without additional restrictions if you do not know your child's skirts especially» she told the web site for the parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The children need stability and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">They were historically calling hermaphrodites the children given birth to with the man and female sex organs — on the name of beautiful Greek god who possessed the signs both of the floors.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And ten years still in total ago the medical association perceived gender as a sheet on which one can wash everything, but then draw again.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now many people are contesting the ethical bases for the surgical operation knowing that the gender identity is complicated, and sometimes, as the child will perceive the floor which was conferred upon him when it grows, the doctors make a false choice while not knowing.</seg>
		<seg id="34">«In the middle of the 20th century this was called: with &quot;pressing psychiatric case&quot;», a Thresher said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When such children were born: you were calling not the psychiatrist you called the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The dominating theory about how to turn with the children with genitaliyami of intermediate type was offered Mani from the university Dzhonsa Xopkinsa who thought that gender is giving way to change easily by the doctor John.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It introduced into a circulation «gender identity» term will be and I/you/he asserted that the signals of the environment, the signals social among them — then , as the parents are raising the child, — interact with the genes and the child's hormones while determining, really the person to consider himself to be a man or a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But they turned up under a question in one case of 1966, well known as «Dzhon/Dzhoan», his theory.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision to castrate the child after removing also his testicles completely, and to raise it as the girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">«Do not attract presented case like the successful example of the transition, but this was so»: a Thresher said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">After there was the boy about 15, it became a boy again and got married to the woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But at the age of 38 years he carried out the suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The thresher said that now some doctors have still been «using this model».</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in 1990th, with internet's receipts, the people that survived these operations on the change of the floor declared about themselves with, dissatisfied, result.</seg>
		<seg id="45">I/you/he was such and the case of Dzhima Bryusa, the 36-year-old writer from staff of Montana which was born with the man's chromosomes XY, but genitaliyami of intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="46">They could not determine the doctor in an exact way, it had the big clitoris or the small penis, and it was convinced that it will never be able to live for the man's full-fledged «life».</seg>
		<seg id="47">Therefore the outer sex organ and the testicles Bryusa were surgically soon after his birth in 1976 removed, and it was being cultivated as the girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Female hormones have started putting him at 12 years at the age.</seg>
		<seg id="49">«I knew that I am not a girl» is told it ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was really complicated to ask the questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At the age of 18 years vaginoplastika was prescribed to him.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But being knowing about a depression also something, what something not so, he demanded the medical documentation.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he recognized was terrible.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized on the birth, and no one has ever told me about this.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bryus was born with the violation of the sexual development which did not let his body make sufficiently the testosterone for the normal development of genitaliij.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After recognizing the truth, it became a man again receiving its breast after also removing the injections of the testosterone.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The operation made it infertile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today it appears under a name Interface Project into the defense of the other ones in organization trying to bring the perception of the people with intersexuality into a norm.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Ehnn Tehmar-Mehttis, the executive director of the Californian legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is worried about what is «inciting» the German law «to navewivaniyu of labels and a stigma».</seg>
		<seg id="60">Many activists are worried about that: that the German law will incite parents to make a hurried decision and to give the child &quot;an indefinite floor&quot;», she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that he will contribute to the intrusion.</seg>
		<seg id="62">I am being counted, the man or female floor better to appropriate, but then to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But therefore we have not seen yet what we can make as this law will show itself all: to build this suppositions.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tehmar-Mehttis said that her organization is maintaining the Australian law in so far as «it is allowing the adult people to make the choice for the benefit of the third floor».</seg>
		<seg id="65">«The adult people have to have the opportunity to make its own decisions about formal sexual accessories she is saying.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law means her appropriation on the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This battle which the small children do not have to enter on this stage.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow, they will be able to make the decisions about their own body at that time.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr Arlin Barac, the mammolog radiologist from Pittsburg, which has a daughter with the violation of the sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in group of support, I/you/she said that the German law «will support» both the parents and the children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">The daughter Barac, Kehti, was born with the man's chromosomes, however it has a violation of the sexual development «the syndrome of the complete insensitiveness to the androgens» under name.</seg>
		<seg id="71">In so far as her androgenic receptors discourteously function, Kehti developed the female signs.</seg>
		<seg id="72">It has vagina, but there are a uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now, at the age of 29 years Kehti is married and is studying ordinaturu on children's psychiatry in the university of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">In spite of the fact that it is fruitless, she is hoping to become a father by means of adoption or gestacionnogo ersatz maternity.</seg>
		<seg id="75">«The law gives the parents the time in order not to make themselves the hurried decisions», said Barac.</seg>
		<seg id="76">It is giving them «man» or «female» one the time to do some analyses and to know a lot in a situation, as well as the time interval before they will write.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In such a case you are in an order — raise the child, like the child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We do not need to carry out hurriedly the operation which is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">This allows the children to participate in the decision and eliminates excitement, who is moving the parents because they do not feel that they are acting correctly» she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Finally the child will decide, with what floor for it or for it comfortable , — also this is fabulous.</seg>
		<seg id="82">This gives the children the chance to make the decision independently.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I voted for president Obamu twice dividing hope into the possibility of changes</seg>
		<seg id="2">He is speaking, that Obama allowed obstructionism it is not possible to reduce the republicans no to any laudable efforts.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Obstructionism is not able to serve as a justification of problems with the web site of Obamoij of the health services being reformed, the attack of bespilotnikov</seg>
		<seg id="4">The memoirs about the campaign of Obamy of 2008 are sad reminding of what could be</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nataniehlj P. Morris is the student of second course of the medical faculty of Garvardskogo university.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I am reading the terribly sad book during these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I thought that this book will inspire me in the times of the dejection on the second course of the medical faculty and will revive the feeling of hope in me.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called «Insolence for victory», and these are memoirs about Barak Obamy of 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When am I finishing with the evening to write the reports on my patients and am I lying into the bed, does this book return me at that time when the policy inspired millions of the people, and the talks could take spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The victory at elections turned out to be impressive, also the leading ones did news programs break for the comprehension of this historic moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates cried with joy, and my parents took care of all the newspapers which they could only find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">To the White House young strategist team had to come, and the people were ready to the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During the entry in 2008 Obamy into post his level of support was 82 %.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then I am closing a book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Return into present is a rough awakening, like pulling out from dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is difficult to remember optimism those days — they seem like distant memory, sad reminding of the missed possibilities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In years which passed ever since I lowered my first ballot paper the changes have really occurred.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This was that, which I did even not can imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I am giving due to Obame for his big and diverse achievements, from the passage of the law on intelligible medical care before our soldiers' withdrawal from Iraq, &quot;do not ask&quot; for the abolition of the rule, «do not «speak», the murders of the Usamy ben Ladena.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Furthermore, I think that the party obstructionism blockaded too many attempts of the advancement of our country ahead: immigration reform, the possibility of the choice of the state health service and the closing of the base in Guantanamo among other ones.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But protecting it in front of the co-workers and the contemporaries, with me after the countless number of the times, when I was turning up in the side of the administration Obamy, the explanations which I can grant ended.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I reached the point of the political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The republicans' obstructionism can not explain the permission for prosluwku of foreign leaders or the infliction of the hits with bespilotnikami on the innocent children in other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He can not explain the data acquisition about the Americans' private life by the Agency of the national security or the pursuits of razoblachiteleij discovering the illegitimate activities of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He can not explain the murder of the American citizen Anvara to alj-Avlaki without court and consequences or the inobservance of the limits of state financing and expenses are during the presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It can not find excuses for the conclusions of the report in which it is being said that the efforts applied by the White House are most «aggressive» in order that to force mass media to become silent «… since the times of Niksona administration».</seg>
		<seg id="27">And recently it can not justify what it is not possible to develop the simple web site into the flow of more than three years after the signature of the law on intelligible medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know whether I should expect this.</seg>
		<seg id="29">I/you/he really owes was at the age to understand that the instruction can contradict the political campaigns which precede it 18 years I?</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is obvious that the work on elective post is not the predictable program of actions in so far as our public dialog will be formed by the opposition political party and such accidental events as the slaughter in Njyutaune.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Nevertheless on all more listed by me above example visible, that they were their own choice of the administration to a considerable degree.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Also this is what worries me most of all.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I voted for Obamu again in 2012, but not therefore, that I was full of enthusiasm concerning his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romni was an incomprehensible and rough alternative, it seemed that it is not in the state to make the decision on its own policy or looks.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I thought that within his second period Obama after liberating itself from the pressure of the future elections it will justify the hopes which we have heard about for such a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, when this week the appraisement Obamy fell beneath 45 %, to return to 2008 by means of this book became much more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="37">This forces me to miss many promises which vanished.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read that part of the book in which is making a slip, as Clinton Obame inflicted a deafening defeat on the primary elections in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At the meeting on the analysis of the causes of failure he told his co-workers that they have to return to a normal course and to remain true to their goal.</seg>
		<seg id="40">«I want, that we returned our attractiveness, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">— We have to recall the one who they are».</seg>
		<seg id="42">Five years, Mr president, passed also I am absolutely agreeing with you.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The acknowledgments of the Agency of the national security strengthen the paranoia of the corporations with regard to the state shadowing</seg>
		<seg id="1">Warm the helicopter of the German police flew August over the consulate of the USA low in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany, during the day at the end conclusion.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On the instructions of the Federal service of the defense of the constitution (BfV), the service of the inner secret service to Germany, was his job to photograph the roof of the building of the representation of the USA, which is less like what in 5 km from the European central bank and Bundesbanka.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The German mass media say that BfV hoped to discover the antennae of the eavesdropping devices, and these actions entailed the negotiations between the USA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department of Germany in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Klehpper, the director of the National secret service of the USA, certified in September again that the USA is not using the possibility of the foreign secret service «for the theft of the trade secrets of the foreign companies in the interest of American companies, in order to improve their international competitiveness or increase their profit».</seg>
		<seg id="5">But ever since Ehdvard Snouden — the contract employee that became razoblachitelem — began to publish his treasury of the secrets the secret services of the USA, the European governments and the heads of the companies are not convinced whether the director on word may believe any more.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The suppliers of the cloudy sets of the USA have the messages about the National agency of the security of the USA being following a Brazilian oil company Petrobras and receiving access to data to those being kept, including Google and Yahoo, they picked up the paranoia of the corporations called, to the new heights, by the shadowing of the state.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A news about that became the last drop, what was listened the chancellor's telephone the Angels Merkelj, about ten years are possible.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Of course, if the most influential persona of Europe becomes can a target, also the leaders of business are potential targets.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snouden made evident the intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the USA and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I think, it is completely probably that these data are being used with mutual advantage.</seg>
		<seg id="11">«Germany has to wake up», is saying Oliver Gryun, the president of the unification BITMi who introduces the small and middle IT-companies of Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The German companies are convinced that the USA is presenting now almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and the theft of the data, according to the research published by the consulting agency EY in July.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless, there were no evidences of the USA passing on the trade secrets of the foreign companies to their own companies in all the documents opened by Mr Snoudenom up to now.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The politicians expressed uneasiness in the EU not grabbing certain possibilities in the field of information technologies and internet, and the opinion that he should try to diminish its dependence from the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The business persons sceptically belong to this.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Somebody says in the parliament of Germany that we have to create the German for Google.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I can shut my eyes only and open them slowly again…</seg>
		<seg id="18">«This is not version», is saying Gasso Plattner, the president of the German company-supplier of the software for business SAP.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If there is necessity of powerful European IT-industry, it was not it to allow her to die more than 20 years ago worth.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Everything is being subsidized in Germany: from coal before the cars and the farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">All, besides IT industry.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And nevertheless coverage and the technical development of the agencies for espionage of the USA becoming well known thanks to revelations Snoudena were the shock for some companies which thought earlier that the biggest risk of shadowing introduces China.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The big shift is going on in cloudy technologies where the heads of the European companies better realized that the data that are kept in the USA are in the same jurisdiction and therefore vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to the research conducted by the trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of her un-American participants refused from the plans to use the services of the cloudy provider being in the USA after the exposure of the American program for the intellectual present Prism analysis.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Dzhim Sneijb, one of the executive directors SAP, said: «We see that the consumers are asking the new question which did not arise a year ago but namely: where my data are kept and you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction».</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many German leaders assert that the last messages are only the confirmation of what they have already known: the moguqestvennye states want to steal away their most valuable secrets, and, therefore, these data should be protected at any price.</seg>
		<seg id="27">That that an industrial espionage is going on — it is unsurprising.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It has always taken place.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This was the object of the discussion many years and substantially did not change in current «polemics», Kurt is speaking the Side, the executive head director of the chemical company BASF.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them because our national interests include this: to defend our commercial businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The leaders of the corporations do not love normally bragging about those counter measures which they undertook because this can grant the enemy advantage.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In big companies the thought has been acquired for a long time, to take free flewku at the exhibition or to leave a notebook without a care in the number of the hotel is this, at least, thoughtlessly.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Uljrix Xakenberg, is member the board of directors of the motor-car company Audi, he is speaking, what already many years this standard practice one to gather the car telephones before the sessions of the management so that they would not be able to be employed as an eavesdropping device.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The federal service of the defense of the constitution of Germany is advising the heads of the companies to discuss the possibility of the use of the simple car telephones prepaid for during the foreign trips due to the vulnerability of the smartfonov.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The car telephones prepaid for are subsequently jumping.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Nevertheless there are the fears that the small and middle companies remain vulnerable for the breakings and the shadowing.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Germany many similar companies are leaders on the world market of their concrete niche.</seg>
		<seg id="38">An experience co-workers and financial resources do often not suffice for small and middle companies in order efficiently to defend the corporate secrets against unauthorized access» he is giving advance notice in the report of BfV.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The USA is giving advance notice to its own companies of an industrial espionage on the side of other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The national reconnaissance summary of the USA in February put France together with Russia and Israel into the second row of the trespassers who are dealing with hacking for economic secret service, after China, is confirming The Washington Post.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Member the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed, that when the talk is about an industrial espionage, the Frenchmen are the worst.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Bernard Skarsini, the former head of the French agency of the inner secret service DCRI, declared as he is being informed, in the interview this month: «The services excellently know that all the countries even when they are cooperating in the fight against terrorism are spying on their allies».</seg>

		<seg id="1">He is writing, on 31st October Mosgorsud decided to declare the license invalid about the registration of the agency &quot;Rosbalt&quot;, &quot;The tape&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Roskomnadzor insisted on the deprivation of the agency of the status of mass media - for systematic and rough law-breakings about mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the course of the process the unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered closing the mass media possible, there is actually the edition counterarguments after refusing in the right to propose.</seg>
		<seg id="4">What are &quot;Rosbalt&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">ZAO &quot;Press agency Rosbalt&quot; was established in St Petersburg in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Into the following years the agency opened the second head office in Moscow and the series of the regional subdivisions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Also at agency representations are working in the countries of the former USSR.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since 2001 &quot;Rosbalt&quot; has been developing and functioned as federal information-analytical agency.</seg>
		<seg id="9">To the middle the 2000th agency entered into the list of the quotients of the internet mass media in Russia most being recognized.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the same time &quot;Rosbalt&quot; has always taken up a quite specific niche: notes with reference to the sources were the kernel of the exclusive publications of the agency (also put together up to now) in law-enforcement agencies.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The conversations about the proximity of the edition to power structures were going on during the whole extent of the existence of the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Together with &quot;Rosbalt&quot; possessing the vast base of the sources in different departments for the benefit of such suppositions also that spoke, that at the head of a project Natalia Chaplina was - Victor Cherkesova wife.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At the same time role is not clear to the Chaplinoij one in instruction of &quot;Rosbaltom&quot; until the end: they mostly call it &quot;a project leader&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Afonina Larissa is the General Manager of the agency, the editor in chief - Nicholas Ulyanov.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Recently &quot;Rosbalt&quot; did not appear in the appraisements of the federal mass media - neither on citiruemosti, nor on auditory.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In October the agency occupied the 25th place in the appraisement of the attendance of the sites of Russian mass media of the version of LiveInternet.</seg>
		<seg id="17">According to the data of same LiveInternet, the average daily auditory of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 000 unique visitors (also up to 500 000 oversights), about three million unique visitors are monthly.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Among the most popular materials in the last five months notes are groups &quot;King and fool&quot; about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relationships with Ukraine, the soloist's death, the pogroms in metropolitan Biryuleve.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The conflict of &quot;Rosbalta&quot; with Roskomnadzorom began in July 2013, after the corrections of the law against the mass media which prohibited the journalists from obscene scolding came into effect.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The department discovered the suppressed vocabulary in two videorolikax published on the site of the agency (&quot;The circus rider from Krasnodar&quot; and &quot;Pussy Riot defiled oil towers&quot;).</seg>
		<seg id="21">The sides are describing the further thing differently.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Roskomnadzor according to discovered videomaterialov accused &quot;Rosbalt&quot; of a rough and systematic law-breaking about mass media and turned to the court with the demand to take the license from an agency.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In &quot;Rosbalte&quot; they were declaring that the claims of the department are illegitimate: first, the rollers were not editorial materials, secondly, the obscene words were camouflaged in them, and, thirdly, the rollers were removed from the site immediately after warning.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The representatives of the agency appealed against the claims Roskomnadzora in the world court - when on October 22, 2013 Mosgorsud took on the claim to Roskomnadzora, the consideration of these complaints has still also been continuing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However already 25 numbers the justice of the peace took decision not into a use &quot;to Rosbalta&quot;: they declared the editor in chief Nicholas Ulyanov guilty of the violation of the code about administrative infringements and punished of 20 000 roubles - for 10 000 behind every roller.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Is evident, this also decided the issue of audition beforehand in Mosgorsude: if to refuse the thought that the issue even earlier might have been decided beforehand.</seg>
		<seg id="27">On 31st October the court made the decision to declare the evidence about registration &quot;Rosbalta&quot; invalid after actually depriving the agency of status of mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is impossible to say that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; remained in solitude in the course of this opposition.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The deputies of Duma supported the agency (26 deputies added the statement to the name of the head Roskomnadzora Alexander Zharov on 10th October; the document itself was handed in on the initiative of KPRF).</seg>
		<seg id="30">The head of the Union of the journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairperson of the journalists' Moscow union Paul Gusev and the head of the presidential Counsel on human rights Michael Fedotov were reporting the illegality of the closing of the edition.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Furthermore, according to Bogdanov, the instruction of Roskomnadzora even granted him some guarantees that it will not come to the comment of the license.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The trial against &quot;Rosbaltom&quot; pointed under whose jurisdiction it is safer there to be the mass media in Russia today - a big question.</seg>

		<seg id="2">I/you/he employed Charli Frehnsis the fluorescentnye properties of the sea animal, in order to work out the shining food</seg>
		<seg id="3">He came to this idea after reading the scientific article about the medusas, and convinced the scientists chemically to recreate his shining white in China.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Ice cream enters a reaction improving the level of a pH in the white with the language of the one who is eating it and forcing it to shine.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Kris is speaking, what in so far as ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth this means, what the more you are licking, it is becoming that more brightly.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Charli, the founder of the the production of the ice cream company &quot;lick me, I tasty&quot;, speaks: «This is improbable thing, but therefore if to talk about production you will still on the most initial stage receive the substances for £200 about 2 g».</seg>
		<seg id="7">The white which we are using for the ice cream enters a reaction with your language under neutral pH.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: after digging with Europe a choice gives to the Scots</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, yet another puppet about independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time they are giving advance notice to us that independent Scotland will have to join the European zone of the free transfer as the condition of the membership in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Comes the trains of stories about the passport check in Bervike and the border between barbed wire along Adrianova of bank.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Really, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed out possible economic advantages of the freer transfers on remaining Europe, although — what is predictable — this did not appear in the headings.</seg>
		<seg id="5">No one also pointed what the member countries of the EC have been wasting on that much time out in order not to turn its formal rules so, as it this is convenient.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In so far as Scotland is not entering zone Wengenskuyu now, the continuation of the inobservance of the demands will become cheap concession for Brussels in place of that, which he really wanted from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So this is history not deserving attention.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Also such old, that it turned into petrifaction: I heard the «duck» about «independence meaning a passport check» for the first time at least 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And nevertheless there is interesting moment lost on the exposition of the ancient tale.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why, in general, does independent Scotland have to carry out the orders of Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why should we change the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here is the present European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe at last zastoporilsya.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With evrokrizisom the project «Europe» is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On the whole European Union the parties, speakers are against the EC or for the abolition of a euro how the single currency, they are assembling power.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is even the party of «Alternative» evroskeptikov «for Germany» in Germany — founded only in this year — emerged from from nowhere and received almost five million voices on federal September elections, after in this way in essence forcing out «The free democrats» (the counterpart of our «Liberal democrats») from Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">An inside opposition has always existed the plan of the creation of federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless the current depression became turning moment.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The measures of the hard saving brought by Berlin and the European central bank, and the fetters laid on the national economies across the storage of the single currency led many people to the thought that the project «Europe» came in too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis is little connected by the euro to the fact that the national governments are working with the excessive deficits of the budget: this was fair only for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a matter of fact evrosistema blockaded its members on exchange rates, profitable for German exporters: that the German politicians also want to protect.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without possibility of the devaluation of the national currency southern Europe turns out into beforehand handicap according to industrial possibilities in the comparison to Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only salutary resource is to cut down on the wages and the public expenditures, which is actively being kept up by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A deeper problem of the productive proficiency of Europe is behind the current problems of the budget and the currency.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of the complex of the activities concerning «green» energy introduced by Brussels — the code which means the subsidization of the French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer — the European industry pays for electricity and four times for gas twice as large than in the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This paralyzingly unfavorable price conditions, as we have already seen in Greijndzhmute.</seg>
		<seg id="26">No freezings of the wages will stop the crushing victory of the cheap schistose gas of the USA over European petrochemical industry in the peace</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result the rebellion ripens, especially in France, once the most violent adherent of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After war the French political elite was considering the EU as the way to check Germany and to put Paris on one level with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin does not need Paris any more as in the resource of the receipt of the political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe after leaving the destroyed economy of France in distress.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result is right, the set of the Seascapes Le of Foams «The national front» presenting against the EC won additional deciding elections after overthrowing the ruling socialist party on the third place just now.</seg>
		<seg id="31">«The front» is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voices — the timely warning for the British Labourites about it not being allowed to proceed from the supposition that the split will automatically effect among the right ones for the benefit of the left ones, now.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What is making Le Foams with its new-found popularity among French white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year in order to create a block in the European parliament against the EC and against the single currency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If is but this is really probable — the parties that the were incited against the EU will receive the support on these elections, such a block will be able to take up for the first time the dominating position in the European parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here is my opinion: soon the growing moods are against the EC and will merge together against the single currency in Europe together in order to destroy a euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it will become again something like indistinct «Europe (the sovereign ones)» of the nations» which the general de Gollyu liked.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and a few economies, зависимых from it can keep a euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I suppose that Great Britain is dissociating from this project hoping to become good friends with the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific points out the probability that Great Britain will stay without attention in the cold of the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">What position does this leave Scotland in?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose the figure of England, Small of the region (in essence).</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, apart from other, to send Berlin and Brussels to the devils.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I am suspecting, that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a freer European agreement provided we will keep our currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The cooperation with other countries-like-minded person will be simpler in unfederal Europe of the nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise it is it to us to discuss the possibility of the repetition of the experiment of Norway and the storage of our economic independence worth.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The government of the Scottish national party is in Scotland — for all that — be offered by the most successful political movement Europe directed against the measures of the hard saving, receiving the impressive majority of the voices in 2011 thanks to objections to the reductions of expenses (also realized) the Labourite Chancellor of the Exchequer Alisterom Darlingom and the coalition of Tory and the liberal democrats which arose subsequently.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Would be to Scotland now absurdly to vote for independence in order that to take measures of the hard saving tied by Berlin and Brussels only.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Afroamerikanskie and the Latin-American girls reach the sexual maturity, as a rule, earlier than their white contemporaries do, show researches.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The physical changes do not mean that the puberty is close</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are no evidences that the hormones or other chemical substances are guilty</seg>
		<seg id="4">The experts think that the epidemic of adiposity can be one of the starting mechanisms of the early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">Tendency towards the early sexual maturity is not expressed so with the boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former correspondent CNN Peht Ehteridzh is a journalist who is specializing in children's health and questions of the family.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The mother should be scared if her daughter's germs of the mamma begin to be grown up and grow your lobkovye hair in 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the annual conference the doctor children's endocrinologist Floor Kaplovitc explained to the American academy of pediatrics that these early physical changes are quite spread among the American girls and are the new norm this week into Orlando, staff of Florida.</seg>
		<seg id="9">«I have been transporting much time calming down the parents — this does normally not mean the fast attack of the full sexual maturity», said Kaplovitc.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The evident signs of the development such as the growing breasts, are lobkovye both the axillary hair and the smell of the body, they appear earlier with the girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But was only the small displacement at the age menarxe (the first menstruation) during the last four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States the average age has been 12.5 years and came down in comparison with 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">«After the breast begins to develop, at least two to three years pass before menarxe, is I/you/he said Kaplovitc, also being the author of the book «The early puberty with the girls: how should we manage this widespread problem».</seg>
		<seg id="14">The time is the that most exact check as the puberty will progress.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The discussion about what is the actual attack of the sexual maturity is being carried on, but it is considered «premature» when the increase of the breast is being accompanied by the burst of the growth up to 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the majority of cases the process will become slower or will come to a halt — this is what the pediatrician can register attentively.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Faster progressing can serve as a basis with the endocrinologist for the analyses in order to exclude the serious such as the tumors or the cysts problems.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are procedures, in order to detain the menstruation also to avert another consequence early: the premature age deterioration of the bones which can ultimately lead to the slowing down of growth and short stature at a mature age.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations in medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, a stage of development, the rate of growth and emotional ripeness.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplovitc is careful with the medicines, but recognizes that «the suppression of the puberty can soften the behavioral problems and the girls' sensations that they are different from the contemporaries».</seg>
		<seg id="22">Another big problem is understandable: the parents do simply not want, that there were with their very young daughters menstruation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">«They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even about that how they will manage matters of hygiene», said Kaplovitc.</seg>
		<seg id="24">This was shock», one woman remembers, with the daughter of which menstruation began at the age of 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although signs were and we talked about a menstruation, it was not ready emotionally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It arrived by her being the first among her friends home from the school of scared and upset.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many advertised theories about the causes of the early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Nevertheless there is no logical proof that the hormones are guilty of milt or other foodstuffs, the chemical substances in the environment or sexual posyly are in some mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">With the boys — as well as with the girl — the puberty is occurring earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplovitc asserts that the prerequisite which has the largest weight is the epidemic of adiposity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In 2001 it helped to conduct the research of the girls from 6 to 9 years which connects the quantity of fat in the organism to the periods of the puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The other data are confirming this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country afroamerikanskie and Latin-American girls reach the sexual maturity, as a rule, earlier than their white contemporaries do.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Different explanations exist.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In the whole world everything is influencing an early puberty, in all probability: from economic conditions and climate before the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Still riddle: although the boys have the hair on the person and appears on lobke at a younger age, tendency towards the complete early puberty is not expressed so as with the girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors who are participating in the conference AAP confirmed the complexity of this topic.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of the pimples and the lobkovyx hair is met even with the babies and the children of day-nursery age.</seg>
		<seg id="39">«We have to be careful about that as we are determining the true attack of the sexual maturity» Dr Lourens Siljverman, the children's endocrinologist, said in the children's hospital of Gorieb to the town Morristaun, the staff of New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The parents do not have to demur receiving the instructions from the pediatrician about that how to speak with its child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">This can mean the conversation earlier than was being expected,» explained Kaplovitc.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you are keeping calmness, your child will react well, as a rule.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Needs a confirmation of the that of the girls who are flourishing early, what when this even occurs earlier more put, this process is the normal part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Although it is also earning S$3000 (2400 $) in a month as administrator and it the husband is also working, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she is speaking.</seg>
		<seg id="4">There is, really, demand in the different parts of Southeast Asia that ValueMax where she will see off her transaction became the third pawnshop registered at the stock market of Singapore this week.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The credit on the guarantee of the jewelry products is not not simply fast way to receive money (S$1300 in the event of Mrs Amirtxalinga), however, it is hardly just as cheap as unsupported bank credits.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The pawnshops are normally adding the effective annual interest rate of 17 % in Singapore — above hardly 15.4 % which are offered in the department of United Overseas Bank, the local creditor with the branch in the same trade center.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However the pawnshops have that advantage that they are not demanding the solvency or proof of the wages check and more fast than the banks can deliver the credits.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Therefore millions of the people in the whole region are turning to some pawnshops in so far as families feel the pressure due to the rise in the cost of living and the fast growth of the liabilities of households and consumer debts.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of stable growth that followed a world financial crisis, and cheap credits that were being fed by the free policy of financial credit in the countries with developed by the economy families are turning with the low and average level of income to some pawnshops, in order to compensate for the decrease of the earnings according to the slowing down the growth of their economies.</seg>

		<seg id="15">«The essence in with the rise in prices the people looking in average and lower part [the scales of earnings] for the ways to replenish its earnings there is where only will be able», Song Seng Vun, economist CIMB, of Malaysian bank is speaking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The high prices of gold strengthened Rekordno in the last two years the haste from which the people have been imparting their personal things because they are using the opportunity to receive the money for its family decorations.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore about 70 % of the things which are imparted in 200 pawn areas of the town-state are golden products.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The people are speaking: «The price of gold looks good, let's we will impart the grandmother's golden chain and we will get it back next month».</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand the biggest operator of the pawnshops EasyMoney watched the stature of the number of the clients who are using his departments in the last months, right up to 20 %.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The growth in pawn business is such, what ValueMax, the operator of the department is in Bendemire and the 15 other same are in Singapore, plan on also expanding not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also beyond the limits of Asia, Ijeax Li Ching, the executive director ValueMax, is saying.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will finance an expansion, making use of 60 percent of S$66 of millions drawn this week as a result of the allocation of the actions in the stock market of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some creditors caused the fire of the critique due to high interest rates, Mrs Ijeax says that the pawnshop offers the cheaper tariffs not only than other creditors, it is also not increasing the debt directly.</seg>
		<seg id="23">«The clients are imparting the objects which they have already owned, and monetizaciya of personal assets does not increase the liabilities of households», she is saying.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Pledge conquers always wider public acknowledgment as resource for the receipt of short-term, provided financing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">And at the same time not only those categories of the people who are in difficult financial situation are using the pawnshops.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The rich people are also using the delimitations by ValueMax in Singapore laying the golden ingots or hours Rolex, which can give up to 60 percent from their buying price the ready money.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see clients from all the layers of the society.</seg>
		<seg id="28">«They include the sound persons who need to borrow the money for the short period for commercial projects or capital investments, or the businesses of the small business, who need to overcome the temporary financial difficulties» Mrs Ijeax is speaking.</seg>

		<seg id="1">While the American planners of the roads are trying to find the money for the repair of the strewing system of the main roads, many people begin to see the decision in the small black box carefully placed on the instrument panel of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">These devices registering every mile being proezzhaemuyu by the motorist and submitting this information to the officials are in the center of the controversial attempt of the modernization of the system of the financing of the highways of America, one undertaken by the planned organs of Washington and staff which became obsolete.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The boring arena of the planning of the highways suddenly normally generated the intensive debates and the colorful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertariancy joined some ecological groups in lobbying of granting of right to the government the uses of the small small boxes for the tracing of the quantity of the miles proezzhaemyx by you and even, it is possible, that, there are also uses where you are passing them, then this information on the composition of the tax bills.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The movement of tea drinking shock.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American union of the civil freedoms is deeply also troubled and is picking up the series of the questions concerning private life.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And although the congress can not make arrangements yet if to continue or not a few staff are not preparing to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are contemplating how one can go in the next decade to the system by which the drivers are paying roads for every mile, which they are passing.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, the part from which have the function of the satellite tracking to a test</seg>
		<seg id="10">This is really necessary for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This not that question» did not say as for which we can have a right of choice» Xasan Ixrata, the executive director of the Association of the governments of southern California which is preparing the plans of beginning of the tracing by the authorities of the staff of miles being proezzhaemyx by every Californian motorist, by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Changes in how we are paying these taxes will be.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Technologies are already for this.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The necessity of this is increasing with the absence of the resources from the Governmental Fund of the construction of the main roads being financed at the expense of the taxes which the Americans are paying on refuellings.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Americans have not bought so much gas anymore as earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The cars pass more miles of one gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Federal tax even, 18.4 cents in a gallon, already 20 years have not risen.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The politicians do not want to improve the tax of even one cent with high prices of gas.</seg>
		<seg id="19">«It is simply impossible to keep «the» gas «tax», said Li Mannich, the expert on transport policy, in the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Recently 500 registering devices of the test of the system of the pomiljnoij payment were installed in his staff on the cars.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This will be the best alternative in the long term», he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The pains in the neck are calling this pomiljnoij user-defined pay.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is natural that this idea draws the city liberals, to an example, in so far as one will be able to change the character of the trips for the reduction of the capacity utilization of the roads and the ejections of the hothouse gases with the help of taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The planned organs in California are observing this system in the course of the development of the strategies for the achievement of the goal indexes established by the ambitious laws of this staff in the fight against the global warming closely.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However the member of the representatives' chamber Bill Wuster (the republican, Pennsylvania), the chairperson of the transport committee of the chamber, said that he is also discussing this system as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The adherents of the free market in fund «Reason» are also excited about that what they will force drivers to pay for every mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">«The tax which will go into the black hole» did not tell Ehdrian Mur this simply», the vice-president on political questions to Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The people are paying for what they are receiving directly.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This movement is also being kept up by the two USA which were the ministers of the transport which called upon a congress in 2011 to move in the direction of the pomiljnoij payment.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The senate of the USA confirmed last year the pilot project with a value of 90 million dollars which about 10 000 cars would take part in.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However the leaders of the representatives' chamber turned down this proposal due to the fears of the village legislators introducing voters which has to pass often many miles in everyday life, in order to reach to work or to the town.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Nevertheless, a few staff and towns are going around this way independently.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The largest enthusiasm appears in staff of Oregon, where for the participation in the biggest experiment in the country 5000 drivers are being attracted.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon for the miles of the run instead of gas tax pay to staff</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Nevada the pilot project has already been completed.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In New York it is looked at.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois is testing it on the limited basis with the participation of the cargo cars.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the coalition studies I-95 who transport departments of 17 staff of the eastern coast are entering (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virdzhiniyu and Florida) as they will be able to conduct these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This conception did not receive the common recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about the volunteers' 50 cars were equipped with these devices recently, the drivers were disturbed with the government being able to register every their step.</seg>
		<seg id="41">«The uneasiness according to cause of &quot;the big brother&quot; and similar things is a big problem», told a Khan, the matters of strategy and department of the effectiveness in the department of the transport of the staff of Nevada manager, Alauddin.</seg>
		<seg id="42">This was not the that people wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="43">After the tests were going on at full speed, the department of the American union of the civil freedoms gave advance notice in staff of Nevada on its web site It will be «quite easy «to turn these devices into the instruments of the full scale tracking».</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no necessity to create the huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure which will inevitably be extended for the storage of the entries about separate citizens' everyday transfers.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one from a few staff where the difficult searches of the inexpensive technology which would have allowed the authorities of the staff of the information the account of the miles proezzhaemyx by the car are being carried out, but without information about place and the time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you will be able to do this, a Khan said, the society will feel more calmly.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The searches of this technology led some agencies of the staff to the small young company in California under name True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">This company did originally not deal with the assistance in the collection of the taxes of the staff</seg>
		<seg id="49">She strove to go to the developing market of the type of selfinsurance on which the drivers are paying according to run.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices which it is testing are drawing the planners of the roads because they are not using GPS and are granting limited amount of information having been loaded with the help of the modem periodically.</seg>
		<seg id="51">«The people will be inclined to do this if you are not registering their speed and their location», said Raijan Morrison, the executive director True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">A few big mistakes in several things were from these pilot programs of the staff</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are much less expensive and less obtrusive ways to do this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon the planners are experimenting with the granting of the different versions to the drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose the device from or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they can quite refuse the device after deciding to pay fixed collection according to the middle number of miles which all the inhabitants of the staff are passing instead of this.</seg>
		<seg id="57">In other places they are hoping to sell the idea to the nastorozhennoij public after forcing to make the devices more, and at least.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York the transport officials are striving to let work out the tax-covering device which will also take the payment on the parkovochnym counters «pay, as you» are «going» also to gather the insurance the pool of the data about the speed in real-time operation from other drivers which the motorists could use to avoid the corks.</seg>
		<seg id="59">«An advantage which they will offer them will draw the motorists to a participation», is speaking in the document of the city planning design.</seg>
		<seg id="60">However, some planners of the transport systems are thoughtful about whether all the conversations about the pomiljnoij payment by simply huge diverting factor not being.</seg>
		<seg id="61">In the city transport commission in the field of the bay of San Francisco the officials say that the congress could very simply have overcome the bankruptcy of the confidential Fund of the construction of main roads after raising the taxes to gas.</seg>
		<seg id="62">One would be able to collect an additional single or annual tax from the drivers of the hybrid cars and other persons whose means of transport are not using much gas that they paid their fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">«There is no necessity in the radical surgical intrusion, when is everything that you should do this to take aspirin», said Rehndi Rentwler, the director of the legislation and public relationships commission.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we will do this, hundreds of millions of the drivers will worry about their private life and the lot of the other things.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Within the framework of the measure a presentation of the new line fit through the production of the electrowelded chimneys of steel.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As the managing director of the business Denis Gribanov said, in 2011 with the appearance of the new owner the marketing research in the research of the commodity market of the steel constructions is conducted in the Tyumen province.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It turned out that the region uses more than 50 000 tons of the electrowelded chimneys in a month.</seg>
		<seg id="4">After this the decision about the change of the profile of the factory and the set-ups in it of the equipment for their production were taken.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Already in this year more than 7 000 tons of the made production are shipped.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The factory capital investments were more than 120 million the руб leu: Denis Gribanov said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In October the new figure is neglected, which it is allowing increasing the assortment.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At a factory simply one big - for building branch is being let out as the small profile of the chimney which is being used for a tep-personal economy, the small forms of the construction and in a furniture industry.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We are planning on leaving for the output level of 50 000 tons of the production in a year, which will be about 10 percent from her consumption in the Tyumen province.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Despite the transition to another type of activity, the co-workers' number did not decrease in the business - now it is 157 people, in plans on the purchasing of the new equipment - the increase of the personnel still more than by 50 workers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the business a further training of the personnel is going, and the necessary specialists are tidying up themselves from the already available ones.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Next year bringing the new aggregate is planning longitudinal sharp the steels with a thickness up to five millimeters, that it will allow reducing the cost price of the production, as well as another figure, at a speed of the production of the chimney up to 47 meters per minute.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Towards the end of 2014 in the business they are preparing to master the issue of the chimneys which are being used for a housing-communal economy.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The leadership of the business is assigning the task to close up to 70 percent of the requirement of the Tyumen province of this production.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The deputy of the director of the department of the investment policy Leonid Ostroumov advised to pay the greater attention to the modernization of the machine building businesses turning to the leaders of productions.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Also the forms of the state support for industry which include the compensation of interest rates according to credits of the purchasing of the new equipment and outlay on his leasing are directed towards this.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the current year on these goals it is foreseen to pick out 150 million roubles, two thirds of this amount are already spent.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The last commission which will discuss the agreements of subsidization is taking documents from the businesses before the 15th November.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Besides, the outlay on the participation of the local producers in the international fairs is being paid by the budget.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The next year the resources at the rate of 150 million roubles which one can use for the compensation of leasing payments and credits of the acquisition of the new equipment are foreseen by the budget.</seg>
		<seg id="21">5 million will be allocated for the participation in the fairs, 3 million are on the programs of energy saving.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Up to 72 million roubles of resource for the compensation of the ordered one and equipment paid for which is being made for the petrol complex in the south of the Tyumen province come down.</seg>
		<seg id="23">According to Leonid Ostroumov, in perspective this form of support will stop because a compensation of the the loot of the mineral resources tax which the oil companies were paying a budget in the regional one was the motive of her introduction.</seg>
		<seg id="24">At present they are not doing this and the subsidies are becoming the direct expense obligations of the region.</seg>
		<seg id="25">With account this the government of the field thinks priority the direct support of the industrial enterprises, and not the financing through them of the oil branch.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The help of the budget will be connected to the investment projects which will be sold on production.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Many heads of the businesses expressed the concern in connection with the developing situation in relationships with the oil industry workers.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The grant for the equipment bought up by them is the competitive advantage of the industry of the south of Tyumen province, and on her abolition price will match itself against the middle stripe of Russia, where a cheaper workforce is, in a difficult way.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Moreover, a question with the succession of the new owner TNK-VR is unclear - the company &quot;Rosneftj&quot; which has not put its orders in the Tyumen businesses yet.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The agreement on realization of the Uvatskogo project flows out in 2013, and the application to his prolongation was not received.</seg>
		<seg id="31">At present the businesses of the south are fields which are specializing in equipment for petrol sector, can not form the portfolio of the orders for the next year.</seg>
		<seg id="32">A question remains open, taxes will really come to the budget of the region from mineral oil to be extracted in the Uvatskom district or they will be paid on place for the registration of the new owner of the deposits.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Russian brewers have a bad mood.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On their prikidkam, the consumption of beer will remain in the former level in the country next year, and this is in a better case.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although the business persons originally counted on the growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But a present year is developing for them unsuccessfully: the sales fell down of 7 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The chapter told to one of the biggest brewing companies of the country about all this, the chairperson of the Counsel of the Union of the Russian brewers Isaac Weps is in the III annual conference of the Institute of the Adam Smita &quot;Goods of the everyday demand in Russia&quot; which was ended in Moscow just now.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In it they discussed the state control of the market.</seg>
		<seg id="7">From 2008 to 2012 are years the Russian market of beer already decreased of 18 percent, in so far as in the last years in the country the essential intensification of the control of the brewing branch in the part of production and the turnover of beer is observed - drink with small alcohol content, I/you/he informed the listeners Weps.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There is not such a hard restriction of the market of beer in a single country of the peace unpredictable introduction all of the new and new illogical bans which supposedly are being substantiated by the fight against the abuse of alcohol.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The brewer complained, that many legislative bans called upon to reduce the level of the abuse of alcohol do not provide a particular influence, nevertheless the new initiatives constantly appear all.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Boljnee all on the producers of beer struck the ban brought since this year on selling alcoholic beverage in the kiosks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;We lost 35 000 consumers immediately&quot;, said Isaac Weps.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The next year the brewers have two forecasts.</seg>
		<seg id="13">That which Weps talked about is optimistic: the sales of the foam drink will remain at the former level.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Pessimistic one - they will fall down still of 2-3 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In order to keep their profits, the business persons have to escape the types calculated for the mass consumer to a class &quot;premium&quot;: the beers will become smaller, but that will cost more.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile, you can not see the radical consequences from the fall of the sales with the small quantity of alcohol yet.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;On my observations, the level of the diseases of alcoholism is left behind approximately at the same level, announced a doctor-narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Really, the share grew the patients that are using the surrogates of the strong drinks, as well as those who &quot;sat down&quot; on the spirtosoderzhaqie drinks toning up like &quot;Yaguara&quot;, while namely a &quot;beer&quot; alcoholism predominated ten years ago.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Wherefore will a construction bring TPU in Moscow</seg>
		<seg id="1">Within every year metropolitan authorities promise to furnish more and more knots of transports and transfer (TPU).</seg>
		<seg id="2">Until 2020 people are planning on introducing 255 TPU into a system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Our correspondent knew a lot what the project is in practice turning into.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A couple of months ago near the subway &quot;Smolensk&quot; Arbatsko-Pokrovskoij of line arose the building fence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The inscription said that the development of the knot of transport and transfer is going on.</seg>
		<seg id="6">All this was really strange, in so far as next to &quot;Smolensk&quot; no overland transport is stopping and, therefore, it is impossible to sit down on it</seg>
		<seg id="7">In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden ring, it is necessary to overcome about 130 meters, including the overland transition across the Karmanickiij alley.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now near &quot;the one Smolensk&quot; almost everything is finished.</seg>
		<seg id="9">A flower booth disappeared, the stand ground for newspapers is dismantled, and asphalt before the entrance gave way to the plaster.</seg>
		<seg id="10">There is the whole transport knot</seg>
		<seg id="11">They are explaining, the knots of transports and transfer are flat bed and main sometimes, in the news service of the metropolitan department of the transport.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Main TPU have not been here yet.</seg>
		<seg id="13">BUT the ones flat bed suppose construction the parka wok, the conclusion of the trade objects, the passengers that are obstructing movement, the creation of the small designs and improvement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In fact, not the transport workers, but the professional welfare organizers from the department of the complete overhaul of the town of Moscow are even dealing with flat bed TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The transport knot is not not certainly complicated construction, is explaining the director of the Institute of the economy of transport and the transport policy of the College of the economy Michael Blinkin.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Sometimes a roof above the head and indicator boards that notify of the time of the arrival of the transport are enough.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here, for example, near the subway &quot;Yasenevo&quot; they opened the completely full-fledged flat transfer knot recently.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Will let without the awnings but with the intercepting parkings and the indicator boards that explain when the bus will come.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But in the pursuit of the quantity the officials are writing down in all the TPU what not popadya.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The city hall has still in 2011 been planning on building on all about all 151 knots, of them 59 sec main construction.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Now 255 TPU quite appear in some plans until 2020.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Of them полтораста promise to give out already in this year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">There are not designated any qualitative criteria, although there is a program of the development of the TPU in the town: Alexander Morozov, the cochairman of the public organization &quot;Town and transport&quot;, is stating.</seg>
		<seg id="24">They are giving a report on the quantity of the objects, but a quality of change often worsens on each of them.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Criteria, according to the expert two have to be: secondly - comfort first a decrease of the time of change is.</seg>
		<seg id="26">You have to change possibility above all the transport method without going under the rain.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Moscow it after all leaves exactly conversely on the development of the TPU at times.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The bright example of the subway &quot;of the VDNX&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The earlier suburban buses arrived from the Yaroslavl highway into the public garden before the main entrance in VVC.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Now they carried their stops on the opposite side of the Gorge warbler on the Astronauts' street.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Is further from the subway, is considerably further from the monorail, but is closer to the apartment houses.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Although the inhabitants did absolutely not want the bus station under the windows and the possible instances complained into all.</seg>
		<seg id="33">With main TPU in Moscow did not set somehow immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="34">They began to build the first of them near the subway &quot;glider&quot; five years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The project was called upon to become model.</seg>
		<seg id="36">And a model of the that really came out as the transfer knot given to the investors to the farm tenancy, is turning into the banal trade center.</seg>
		<seg id="37">No, there are platforms for the buses, an awning also three floors of the parking lots here in order not to come from the subway in the rain.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Really, №202 and №203 did not give to the ximkinskim trolley buses fundamentally in Moscow TPU of place.</seg>
		<seg id="39">They moved them as the foreigners aside from the subway as far as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But places are more under commerce remained.</seg>
		<seg id="41">One only the clothes 32 shops, but, in general, there is almost everyone - from the Zoya goods to the motor show.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Of course indeed, suddenly which of the passengers of the bus will need to buy the new car on the way?</seg>
		<seg id="43">When they are building main TPU our trade center has for different reasons always turned out.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Recently situation reached its logical completion after they had decided the part of the parking lot it to reek under the market.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Now on the third floor of the TPU &quot;glider&quot; among planned ones to the skirt of the parkovochnyx places a brisk commerce is going.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The vegetables, the spices, are Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and the guards who spitefully look at our photographer.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The transfer knot turned into the market in a final way.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The thing is that earlier the subway &quot;glider&quot; had a market, but they took it down.</seg>
		<seg id="49">And in the prefecture they felt sorry for the merchants and put on the intercepting parking of the transfer knot</seg>
		<seg id="50">Anyway due to high prices it is empty there always.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The one very after all funny, that they took down the market for the sake of in order to build in his place... new flat TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Such a is castling here.</seg>
		<seg id="53">Near the subway &quot;Kaluga&quot; the distance of approach from the vestibule was the subway to the bus 50 meters: Alexander Morozov is saying.</seg>
		<seg id="54">After the construction of the trade center, supposedly TPU, the distance increased up to 170 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="55">In order to sit down into the bus, it is necessary to fit through the whole trade center.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After 22 hours, when it is closed, one has to outstrip it under the open air.</seg>
		<seg id="57">However, the constructions will soon seem like flowerets on &quot;glider&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In the middle of September the city planning land commission of the city hall confirmed the planning decisions for first eight main TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Four of them will be 25 stories, without regard to two to three underground stages.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The main monster will appear near the subway &quot;Tuwino&quot;, there will be 418700 square meters of the area in it</seg>
		<seg id="61">The representatives of the head office of the railway stations of the RZhD responsible for the construction of the TPU near the subway have already told to the journalists: in future mnogoehtazhkax the shops, the hotels and the apartments will be situated.</seg>
		<seg id="62">At the same time the officials swear that the multi-layer parkings of zaij­mut are from third up to half of the area</seg>
		<seg id="63">We will take the &quot;people's&quot; garages for example.</seg>
		<seg id="64">We will say, the garage on 258 car which recently they erected in the International street has the area of 8015 square meters.</seg>
		<seg id="65">This means for parkinga of 2600 automobile near &quot;Petrovsko-Razumovskoij&quot; &quot;about 80 000 squares&quot; will be needed.</seg>
		<seg id="66">This is smaller than the third from that maxiny which there they are preparing to build.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Let one to two floors go to all platforms for the buses.</seg>
		<seg id="68">It remains like the minimum of 150 000 square meters of the commercial real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="69">BUT this, on the minute, almost two GUMa.</seg>
		<seg id="70">If railwaymen are building main TPU at the stations and the stations, the metro employees will settle the remaining grounds.</seg>
		<seg id="71">They also promised that many &quot;objects&quot; of the functional purpose&quot; will be, including the hotels, the offices and even the gyms.</seg>
		<seg id="72">Is by the way, in the department the properties of the town of Moscow told the journalists which they work out the project of the decree according to which the investors will be able to turn for TPU to the officials outright during the receipt of the area recently.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Without all contests.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Therefore, probably, that the transport questions for the town are priority.</seg>
		<seg id="75">Ideal TPU is, for example, these are stations &quot;Garvard&quot; in Boston or &quot;Spadaijna&quot; in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is convinced.</seg>
		<seg id="76">There the trolley buses and the streetcars are going down under the earth on the level of the subway and the distance of the approach from a car of the subway to the streetcar is 50 meters in total without exit to the street.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Around any unnecessary commerce.</seg>
		<seg id="78">But he is deserting the Moscow officials in extreme.</seg>
		<seg id="79">Either we will not form anything or we really otgroxaem 25 floors with the offices and the apartments.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The corporation Bombardier, the Canadian producer of the planes and the trains, announced the reduction of the net profit by 15 percent under the influence of the quantity of orders and deliveries of the planes in the third quarter and problems with the contracts which diminished on Thursday in her railway subdivision.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The company Bombardier put in Montreal did also not publish any data on the flight tests of her newest plane of CSeries and did not provide the new information about whether the ambitious plans being fulfilled according to the introduction of the plane to the commercial use by the next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the first flight of the experimental model of the aircraft, taking place about one and a half months ago, it still flew only three times, which is causing the questions whether stage of the graph tests is going on.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Results did not find excuses for forecasts and led Toronto to the fall of the shares at more than 8 percent in the Stock Market.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Kehmeron Doerksen, analyst National Bank Financial, reduced his evaluation on Thursday from «above of middle market» before «of middle market» due to the conviction that the growth of the actions is limited into the nearest quarter or the nearest two.</seg>
		<seg id="6">«Although the reduction of the quantity of the deliveries of aircraft was predictable as a whole, we, undoubtedly, are disappointed by the indexes of the profit of the transport department», said Doerksen in the review of the fund market.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will receive the new orders in CSeries according to the continuation of the program of the flight tests.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Nevertheless, if he will not be declared about new orders in next months, we suppose that the market will more sceptically relate to a program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The company Bombardier hopes that the family of the planes of CSeries will allow her to conquer the place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus dominate now.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first experimental model of the aircraft was presented in March and the flight in September carried out the delays for the first time after a few months.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Meanwhile however no hard orders for CSeries have been too many to 177 in so far as the potential customers are waiting for the results of the flight tests in order to check the assertions of the company about fuel effectiveness and the potential economy of the new liner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">All now are 403 orders and an agreement with 15 clients and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The executive head director Pierre Boduan was convinced that Bombardier will attain his goal into 300 hard orders at the moment, after the first plane will be started into the commercial use.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday the leaders also assured the analysts and the mass media that the program is progressing in a plan forward.</seg>
		<seg id="15">«The test model of the plane has not been left behind on earth longer, by which she was being «expected», said Boduan after adding that the overland tests and the renewals of the software were planned for the downtime of the plane during the telephone conference.</seg>
		<seg id="16">All the producers are planning the tests differently.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We decided to organize the first flight and to take the break on the renewals, we also so acted.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It will so occur during the whole program of the flight tests.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The flight on next weeks has to make the second of five test models and all remaining ones will follow it soon as the company announced.</seg>
		<seg id="20">And nevertheless the analysts are sceptically relating to a statement about the first client being able to begin the use of the plane of CSeries 12 months after his first flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company Bombardier declared that she is estimating the period of the putting into operation and will provide the new information in a few next months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This slow tempo of the flight tests is at least, in all probability, and it corresponds to the inside graph Bombardier - supports our point of view, that the putting into operation will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015», Doerksen said.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter which ended on 30th September the net profit Bombardier decreased up to $ of 147 million, or 8 cents for action from $ of 172 million, or 9 cents for action last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The corrected profit on action remained former — 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The Valovyij income decreased unimportantly — with $ 4.2 are up to $ 4.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The analysts expected the profit of 10 cents on action and the valovyij income of $ 4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth in the peace according to the size producer of the planes announced that he installed 45 aircraft in a quarter, which is smaller than index in the previous year — 57.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The common number of the orders fell down from 83 to 26 planes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The portfolio of the orders of the aerospace department was $ 32.9 billion in 30th September without having changed since the 31st December.</seg>
		<seg id="30">«In the aerospace field results corresponded to our goals, however the low number of the orders being received and the common market conditions became unpleasant factor», said Boduan.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The Valovyij income from aerospace direction fell down of 13 percent — up to $ 2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the producer of the trains, biggest in the peace announced that the valovyij income appeared in this sector by hardly 11 percent — up to $ 2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The portfolio of the orders was $ 32.6 billion in transport subdivision in 30th September, which has been a little above index from the 31st December.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The problems with the implementation of a few big contracts negatively effected the earnings of the transport subdivision.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The instruction declared that in the fourth quarter the new plan of development will be presented.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The shares of the company Bombardier which also announced that the head financial director of the corporation Google Patrik Pichett will join a board of directors fell down of 8.5 percent — before S$4,83 in the trading in the middle of Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third in the peace according to the size commercial producer of the planes and the nearest competitor Bombardier, announced the decrease of quarterly income of 10 percent on Thursday.</seg>
