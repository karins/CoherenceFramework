		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which would have included the width of the seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class stores, but its main American rival, Boeing says it must solve the airline.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of increasingly large versions of their long-haul planes, and the event 17 - 21 November expected potentially record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The layout of the rear part of the plane - especially the sitting whether 9 or 10 people in a row - occupies a central place in the statements about the economic efficiency of the new &quot;projects &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing argues that its new 777X will be reduced to 406 people, proceeding from the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed by 10 in each row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says that its competing version of the A350 will be transported in the economy class, there 350 people on seats 18 inches wide, located on nine in a row.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Aircraft manufacturing giants often exchanged blows on technical issues with the help of professional advertising in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public before last in Dubai, where the 777X, is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">She recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers slide representing three people in the restaurant, each other, titled &quot;you would agree to this? &quot;</seg>

		<seg id="14">Waist, the average American male of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the U.S. Public Health Service.</seg>

		<seg id="16">Airbus says it ordered a study indicating that extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputed Airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find balance between tariffs and amenities.</seg>
		<seg id="18">According to her, the research shows that usability salon depends not only on the width of the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It really comes down to providing airlines choices and opportunities to do what they think they need to do to succeed, &quot; said Specialist Boeing saloon in Kent.</seg>

		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind this dispute is worth the race for orders for planes, estimated at least $700 billion on prices in the coming decades - enough to change the balance of the American and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As first reported by Reuters agency in July, the location of the seats is what fuels rivalry in the battle between the newest planes.</seg>
		<seg id="25">As the Airbus as well as Boeing claim 20-процентном improving profitability at one place in their latest long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-местным Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>

		<seg id="27">Winning the specific cost declines when compared with 10-местной layout used currently.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;The reason why Boeing is doing is to squeeze in more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared with our development, &quot; said Kevin, head of passenger comfort Airbus in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, analysts say that salons with full 10-местными rows for existing 777-х indicate that many passengers prefer dense, which can go hand in hand with lower fares.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;seat width of 18 inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the proposal Airbus due to the threat from 777-й model, &quot; said Specialist Interior Salon Mary Kirby, founder and editor of girl network.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists shed light on how the tail of a dog tied to her mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier research has shown that happy dog tail in the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while worried dog tail mainly in the left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now, scientists say that other members of the family dog may notice these subtle differences in the tail and react to them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio, from the University, said: &quot;It is well known that people from the left and right side of the brain in different ways to participate in shaping the stimulators, which are positive or negative emotions. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we have tried to look at this and other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that just like humans, dogs have the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs react to various tails of other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the frequency of a heartbeat of animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is likely that very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction and sometimes in another.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The professor said: &quot;We have shown the dogs video with dogs - or naturalistic version or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the motion of the tail and guide the tail more to the left or to the right. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals seen that otherwise nothing expressing the dog had driven the tail right (from the point of view of the tail of a dog), they were totally relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they noticed that the tail was largely left (again, from the point of view of the tail of a dog), their heartbeat and they looked alarmed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The professor said that he did not believe that dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience, about what movements they should worry, and what is not.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He says: &quot;If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their tail in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, while the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of that experience. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Researchers say that these findings may give owners, vet and deeper understanding of the emotions of their animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">An expert in the field of behavior of dogs, John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher in veterinary school, Bristol University, said that it was not the first study to verify that are important for dogs, the left and right side.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn the head to the left, if they look at an aggressive dog and right, if they look at the dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in other scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: &quot;dogs often approached when its tail drawn to the left, not right, rather than become alarmed - the opposite behaviour towards the Italian research. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies are not entirely susceptible animals in films or as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;While in various mammals there is sufficient evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still have to be reconfirmed, and dogs are no exception, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, given the ease with which may be registered by their behavior, it is likely that very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction, and sometimes - in another.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Russia beyond the struggle for urban pollution cars</seg>
		<seg id="1">Attempts to solve transport problems of large cities were observed in most cities around the world since the second half of the 20th century.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As a rule, it was either about their &quot;imaginary &quot; and expanding highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trip, the number of cars and the time of their use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is a well-known example of Singapore where introduced strict quota increase in the number of private vehicles, and the right of their purchase is bought at auctions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Its price is two to three times more than the price of the car.</seg>
		<seg id="5">European cities, including London, have introduced a fee to enter the city center.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called Green Zone, where entry is permitted only with a specific vehicles that use the fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric cars).</seg>
		<seg id="7">Beijing &quot; s Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 &quot;five-year plan for clean air&quot; worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).</seg>
		<seg id="8">As he told Kommersant the director for control of transport pollution of the municipal bureau of environmental protection in Beijing, Lee, the main objective of the plan is the reduction of major air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, an increase in the number of private vehicles to a level not exceeding 6 million (currently 5.2 million), as well as an increase of no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the agency, now motor vehicles in Beijing responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Among the key measures of the program - limiting the use of road transport, as well as the imposition of additional taxes for car owners.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Among other things, the urban &quot;green&quot; measures in the plan include a streamlined compared with the rest of the country transition to fuel standards, the introduction of local systems and labelling of cars and fuel restrictions on entry of cars in the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (besides, creating a financial incentive programs, replacing older cars to hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric vehicle (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-speed).</seg>
		<seg id="12">Among the automotive innovation Beijing also refers to ban all private cars on movement within the fifth transport ring (a total of six) in the capital of them one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the sign of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of registration plates for vehicles based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to the state programme of &quot;environmental protection for the years 2012-2020&quot;, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).</seg>
		<seg id="14">According to the data of the ministry of natural resources and, in 2011, the &quot;mobile sources&quot; had 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars in ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the Russian Federation until just starting to think about the possibilities of restricted regulation of cars on the streets of cities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The director of the Institute of Economics of transport and transport policy HSE Mikhail believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car travel, is a matter of заведомо unpopular, they can be accepted by society only under the condition of their complete versatility.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences, service and personal vehicles, as well as the cars &quot;privileged&quot; users, the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow).</seg>
		<seg id="19">In the last few days from the center in St. Petersburg, prepared the study, which analyzed the balance of urban areas between the residential development of pavement and a number of vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The main findings of researchers: City center accessible by roads in two times less than the required, and the majority of motorists living in the center, do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time on the market, or simply on the streets.</seg>
		<seg id="21">As a result, it is proposed to build not parking and storage of cars, not to expand and reduce road a part (so that the streets were becoming more friendly for pedestrians), as well as limit the use and placing personal transport within the conservation area of historic centre (common ground around 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).</seg>

		<seg id="3">In this country, doctors are not so much - just one in 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges is one of our top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>

		<seg id="7">This man receives $250,000 to continue their outstanding work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges saw his father back to life and again sink into unconsciousness, wandering across hospitals, which were not properly equipped to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At first he had only a broken hand but the contagion spread to the brain and provoked, which reminded about himself to the end of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;In Cameroon had no neurosurgeons&quot;, said Georges.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If we had the money, we would have taken him from Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment that they could get.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not easy&quot;, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">- You can leave the house at 5 a.m. to run back to the hospital to be first, but you are not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Patients very much.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some may die because they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation is not much changed since his father died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon, only one doctor for 5,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">By comparison, the ratio in the United States - one doctor at 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if it could go to the doctor, many of them it would not under budget.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two of the five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health spending in it are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Their only problem is poverty&quot;, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Poverty - and because they cannot enjoy their life. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, became determined to do something with it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Last year, Dr George and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a doctor and works vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He also founded the non-profit organization, which organizes trips into the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have helped almost 32 000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, and he is still up to 30 people in the vans, which chain roofs to medical supplies and travel over rough terrain to visit villages need help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Not always accompanies them luck.</seg>
		<seg id="32">More than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they come, they are met by how true heroes: this holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms, which can only offer the locals.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration, and with his broad smile and boundless energy, more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning the brigade begins accepting hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We have 500 people on each trip, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come from the whole vicinity within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people get treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others may get walkers, donated glasses or free birth certificates - documents necessary for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evenings the brigade performs simple operation under local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Operations tend to take place in a school, community or in the house; after the procedure, patients come and go in the zone, to make room for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Using a generator to provide lighting operating and sanitization equipment, and its volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">This pace, but the determination of the brigade typically help to keep rural musicians.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They all night beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the brigade members sent back to town, tired but proud of his work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">This group, consisting of foreign doctors and medical students, has 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their assistance may be of great value for those whom they help.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One man explained that they obtained free surgery for hernia treatment will allow him to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;This will change the future for me and my family&quot;, the man said.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to these clinical methods at weekends and work in a hospital surgeon also works nights in a private medical clinics around the Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It is this second work, he said, provides 60% of funding his non-profit organization; the remaining funds are covered by private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I don &quot; t even know when he sleeps, &quot; said Kathy O &quot;, a second year medical student at a university in Philadelphia, the volunteer in the group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He has always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization to be able to continue this campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For future doctors and nurses, such as the 'coming from the United States and Europe to join in the realisation of its objectives, it is an opportunity to practice, which they would never have got at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We have got an opportunity on operations, where we helped remove blood stains or keep tools for doctors, &quot; said about '.</seg>
		<seg id="56">While you would never have received such a possibility in America.</seg>
		<seg id="57">They usually pay for their travel in Cameroon, often arriving with pharmaceuticals.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But on arrival in Yaoundé, their meals, transport and training pays.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is a hero, without a doubt, &quot; said about '.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.</seg>

		<seg id="1">This week, the black list &quot;of the Russian mafia in America by new names and four companies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The US Treasury has imposed a &quot;fraternal circle&quot; of three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis.</seg>

		<seg id="6">&quot;The statement of 'sister circle' more like a attempt to unify fragmented criminal groups&quot;, earlier said an expert on organized crime and Professor Mark Galeotti from New York University.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In his opinion, the &quot;fraternal circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of &quot;Russian mafia&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;I haven't found anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would have confirmed the existence of a criminal organization&quot;, said Mr Galeotti American Center for Research on corruption and organized crime.</seg>
		<seg id="9">With Mr. Galeotti agrees and Liz Shelley, a professor at George Mason University.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but no organization&quot;, brings her words of the Center for the Study of corruption and organized crime.</seg>

		<seg id="13">So, activities and Zacharias, the list in 2012, was closely connected to Grandpa Hassan, but another participant list, Temuri Mirzoyev, had his grandfather's nephew.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Nevertheless, Mr Galeotti notes that some personality and have nothing to do.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In his opinion, all of them feature more common financial and criminal interests, such as the delivery of drugs from Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the &quot;fraternal circle&quot; Gregory - beloved singer Russian President Vladimir Putin - has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This is primarily a crisis of arrears on unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in employees.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of this growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Lately, he is entirely driven by consumption, which almost does not ease up turnovers, &quot;said chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens box representing yesterday quarterly report anywhere on the Russian economy.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="6">With inflation at 6 percent, he will be able to meet future consumer demand roughly at the current level, expect at Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, however, it is likely that they will optimize expenses.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are rising by 10 per cent, while GDP is only 2%, &quot;explained Mr box.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Companies faced with declining profitability.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If it does not rise, it can lead to lay-offs and rise in unemployment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Not to raise the salaries of Russian businesses cannot, narrated by the chief economist at Barclays Capital in Russia and the CIS, Vladimir.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In order to attract employees from the side or to retain the current employers to raise wages.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Consumption in Russia ­ and very fast growth.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to Mr. Fields, because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans effect on the economy of the country, this kind of lending is not.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;The benefit to the economy from growth, we have not seen any money, not diverge on the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments&quot;, said economist.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But the problem in another - at Goldman Sachs expect growth of arrears on unsecured credit.</seg>
		<seg id="18">They are mostly not rich who have nothing to offer as collateral.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Interest rates on such loans are high.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, they often do not return, &quot;said Mr. column.</seg>
		<seg id="21">So the second threat to economic growth in Russia - a possible crisis of arrears on unsecured credit.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The director of the HSE Institute banking Vasily already sees signs of a banking crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Small credit organizations without access to cheap resources, which have been forced to attract means from population with high interest.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In response, out on the trail of the war and began to cut lending rates, &quot;continues the economist.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Small credit organizations cannot give loans under the same interest rate, otherwise they will have negative interest margin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If not abandon dumping, Russia threatens a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Depriving the licenses of some banks in recent weeks, the economist believes it to be the harbinger of a mass crash.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;themselves with such a situation fails: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis&quot;, warned the head of the Institute.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But consumption growth will slow and without crisis defaults, believe in the prestigious, &quot;due to the refusal of indexing salaries for civil servants and the military, inherent in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Partially hit consumption will be softened by the tariff freeze natural monopolies (and, as a result, reduced inflation).</seg>
		<seg id="31">But only partly: if investments do not rise (and the prerequisites for this are not yet available - see the certificate), the growth in consumption is still slow, sure in Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Vladimir from Barclays Capital until it sees the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios.</seg>
		<seg id="33">&quot;The main risk is still falling oil prices&quot;, he says.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In his estimation, Russia &quot; s economy begins to shrink with the cost of oil below $90 per barrel.</seg>
		<seg id="35">At Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is unable to cut interest rates in the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has fallen, and banks have been raising rates.</seg>
		<seg id="37">This may mean that they did not believe the central bank, the transition to inflation, &quot;said Clemens box.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The central bank's policy on market rates did not affect, affects only the interbank lending rates.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;For the central bank, it is the collapse of all expectations&quot;, praised Clemens box.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The money obtained at auctions, the central bank, banks are not lending to the economy, and to manage its liquidity</seg>
		<seg id="41">As soon as the reduced rate, just changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the rouble.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;Sooner or later, the central bank will understand that this strategy is not working&quot;, said Mr column and reminded that allow the ruble to &quot;float&quot; the state is planning by the end of 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But will either do it before, or pick up a key central bank rate (5.5%), he says.</seg>
		<seg id="44">In his estimation, the ruble is artificially overvalued by 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Only one road - the ruble weakening, &quot;concludes the expert.</seg>
		<seg id="46">But if the central bank in even the shadow of a doubt that the elimination of exchange rate band is not part of the policy to weaken the currency, it can ruin the ruble is much stronger.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: &quot;air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes (but not call from a mobile phone) &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talking on mobile phones - according to the long-awaited new guidelines, published on Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, &quot;said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">FAA, airlines will have to show how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they update their training manuals for members of the flight crew and the rules for laying devices to conform to the new guidelines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">FAA announced that it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among airlines, which have already submitted plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the condition of the plan we could approve the extension of the use of electronic devices very soon, &quot; said FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and captain will not give &quot;good. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers should turn off their devices again when a plane goes down for planting, and will not include them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;After the new policy will be implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier, in order to achieve this, it will be the win-win option, &quot; said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We frankly are tired of feeling &quot;at school &quot; when it comes to this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Internet connection for surfing, exchange of electronic letters, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at the height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thus, still no &quot;Words With Friends &quot; - intellectual gaming, in which actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was a notable case: the actor was filmed with the airline American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the aircraft was at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But heavier devices, such as laptops, still need to be laid in the office because they can injure someone if they were flying around the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Calls from the mobile phone in flight also will still be banned.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Regulatory powers on telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA may remove a ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month mark from the National Council on transport security, national security expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered at risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Cell phones - it really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we know thanks to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when the plane is in the air, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An advisory committee created by the FAA to study this issue, recommended last month that the government allowed the more widespread use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years, the growing pressure on the FAA with the aim of easing restrictions on their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as Democrats Senator from Missouri Claire, argue that there is no legitimate reason for the prohibitions relating to security.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions also becomes more difficult to provide, as well as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions off its devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">FAA began to restrict passenger use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of for navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began to carry - high-tech gadgets of the time.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they also developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airline offered passengers using Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes already for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Planes, modified for also more resistant to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of aircraft adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today &quot; s electronic devices emit radio signals are usually much lower power than previous generation devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals at pages.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But signals are becoming stronger, when devices upload or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among those who pushed for easing restrictions on the use by passengers of electronic devices was a company</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, company representatives have downloaded a airliner their devices for reading electronic books for Kindle and flew him to check for problems, but never found them.</seg>
		<seg id="40">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices presents no risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers, said she thinks the interference from devices real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages to pilots, confirming that the devices might be creating interference for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Nevertheless, the committee recommended that FAA has allowed pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during landings on basic in limited visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a reasonably intelligent step toward passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection, &quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed a vaccine, which could deprive the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests are needed before the trials on humans, in that it will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are encouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit, all methods available in the market today, but they discovered that nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern means, &quot; said Professor Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus infects liver cells selectively, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing the negative them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker strike.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In tests, mice, which later gave nicotine, continued their normal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But the mice who were given the vaccine, &quot;relax our effort relying solely, &quot; and it is a sign that the nicotine reached out to their brain&quot;, say the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">These experiments described in the journal Science Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections needed to do so often that they were expensive.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it makes liver cells in the factories of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it would give the children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely that she will use smokers to quit.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of this habit, &quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="4">Frontier said it will charge $25, if the fee is payable in advance and $100 if travellers will pay only once at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A spokeswoman for Frontier Kate 'said that the $100 fee should force passengers to take care about payment in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We do not want to charge for it, &quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines began to charge for the first and second bag in your luggage, in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers trying to avoid these fees, as much as they can in hand baggage, in Upper luggage compartments because of what these compartments are not enough places.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Charges - one way to carry fewer passengers on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O said that this new fee is actually not for the sake of making money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The fact is that the most loyal clients frontier say find a place at the top of the luggage compartments becomes increasingly difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy tickets on the site of the airline should not be paid.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier flight might be able to carry a bag for free, while the next customer in the queue may pay $100 for the same bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O said that changes to procedures on the website and in registration counters frontier is meant to ensure that the passengers will know about collecting before they get to the exit of the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">A new frontier for hand baggage fee will not apply until the summer, although the date has not been settled.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often complain of fees for baggage and other fees, but the airline adore them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street believe the addition of baggage fees sign that airlines collect enough money to cover the costs of flights after several years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But most of them are out of hand baggage fees.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. has introduced the first hand baggage fee for three years ago and another discounter air later followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with this collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, a consultant for airlines, said Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the extra fees.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In his assessment of the report from December 2011, the charge for hand baggage brings the spirit of $50 million per year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines senior manager, recently flew on flight spirit, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, where the passengers will face an unusual collection of spirit for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The process of planting was the smooth from those that I have seen in my career in the airlines, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the landing passed rapidly. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also follows the spirit in relation to fees of $2 for coffee, tea or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier said that passengers who receive or juice, can leave a whole jar and that coffee will be provided free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It will still be free to distribute water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways for a while trying to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned that after seven months, after passengers began to complain, and no other major airline not followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The initiative of the frontier to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline, is her latest measure to attract customers to its Web site.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, not to travel.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But all Frontier went further in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, she started to give two times less miles often flying passenger clients who bought tickets through online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday, she cut the number of miles up to 25 percent of the miles of travel.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So, the trip to 1,000 miles from the frontier, bought from online travel agency, would get 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the website of the frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming loss.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Revenue decreased 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results announced on Wednesday the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic tries to improve finances frontier in the sale of the airline.</seg>

		<seg id="3">The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as &quot;uncertain &quot; or&quot; by &quot; in their evidence about the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents that can take quick decisions about surgery for assigned sex of the newborn, and combat discrimination against people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One man, according to the BBC, he said many years later: &quot;I am not a man, not a woman. &quot;</seg>

		<seg id="11">New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Children create an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but the majority of children do not have them, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can assign to the floor without surgery, and then see how personality develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Science about how the child will develop a gender identity, not too accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nobody can answer questions about why this is happening.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is like a puzzle about why people are being homosexual.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The report sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes the people as distinct from transgender or transgender because their condition relates not to, and to their biological structure which does not correspond to solely neither male nor female sex, and typical of both at once or not is not one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual symptoms such as muscle mass, hair distribution cover, chest and physique; primary sexual symptoms, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and.</seg>

		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal has already allow adults to male, female or &quot;third sex &quot; in its official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, a 52-year-old resident of Australia became the first person in the world, &quot;acknowledged &quot; in court, having the right to maintain&quot; undetermined &quot; sexual status for life.</seg>

		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues still arouse controversy, according to a news release on the TV channel France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this a deeply Catholic country, signed a petition to remove the &quot;gender theory &quot; from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice and sexual activity - no, we are still two pillars of civilization. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported website baby zone that she would prefer that children installed a floor at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;It is difficult to raise a child and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child, &quot; she told the Web site for parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born with male and female sex organs, called - named handsome Greek god who had signs of both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And yet just ten years ago the medical community gender as a sheet on which we can all erase and then draw again.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now many are questioning the ethical justification for surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult, but doctors sometimes makes the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to the floor when he grows up.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the middle of the 20th century, it was called&quot; urgent psychiatric case &quot;&quot;, Drescher said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When children are born, you rang no psychiatrist - you rang the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The dominant theory about how to treat children with intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Mani at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender easily amenable to change.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He introduced into circulation term &quot;gender identity &quot; and argued that the signals of the environment, including the social - how parents produce a child - interact with genes and hormones child, determining whether a person is considered to be a male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one case of 1966, known as the &quot;John / Joan&quot;, his theories are in question.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during the suit circumcision fully castrating child, also by removing his testicles, and raise him as a little girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Mani has presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but this was not the case&quot;, said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When he was about 15 years old, he again became the boy and married to a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But in 38 years, he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher said that today, some doctors are still &quot;apply this model. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived the operation for a sex change, declared himself &quot;disgusted &quot; by the result.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such was the case, by Jim Bruce, a writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors could not accurately determine whether he has had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he will never be able to live a &quot;normal life &quot; men.</seg>
		<seg id="47">However shortly after his birth in 1976 external sexual organ and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he grew up as a young girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He began to give female hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I was not a girl, &quot; he said</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But being in the Depression and understanding that something is wrong, he demanded the medical documentation.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he learned was dreadful.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at birth, and nobody ever told me about it.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development, which gave his body does not produce enough testosterone for normal development of genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After learning the truth, he again became the man, taking testosterone injections and removing his chest.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The procedure made him sterile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, he performs in the protection of others in the organization called interface project, trying to bring in the normal perception of people with.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Ann, executive director of California Advocates for legal association is informed choice, is concerned that the German law &quot;encourages to labels and the stigma. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give the child&quot; undefined &quot;floor, &quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that he will promote the intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We believe that it is better to assign male or female gender, then to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we haven't yet seen how this law would behave, so all that we can do is to make suppositions.</seg>
		<seg id="64">She said that her organization supports the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults to make choice in favor of a third floor. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex, &quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="66">German law implies its assignment at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">It is a battle in which young children should not enter at this stage.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions regarding their own bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr Baratz, from Pittsburgh, which has a daughter with violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law &quot;support &quot; as parents as well as children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because its receptors work incorrectly, Katie have developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now, at 29, Katie is married and studies in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Despite the fact that she was able to conceive, she hopes to become a parent via adoption or having gestational surrogate motherhood.</seg>
		<seg id="75">The law gives parents the time to not take any hasty decisions themselves, &quot; Baratz said.</seg>
		<seg id="76">He gives them time to do any analysis or understand the situation, as well as the amount of time before they write &quot;male &quot; and&quot; female. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this case, you are in the order - baby love child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a lovely child, and you feel joy.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We do not need to hastily make an operation that is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;It allows children to participate in solving and eliminates excitement that motivates parents, because they do not feel that doing the right thing, &quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">In the end, the child decides how Paul him or her more comfortable - and that &quot; s fine.</seg>
		<seg id="82">This gives children the opportunity to decide for themselves.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the execution of decisions of the Judge Sheindlin will be suspended pending the results of the appeal lodged with the city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the Constitution in how he carried out a programme of street detention and questioning.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city appealed to her decision and resolutions on corrective measures, including a requirement to appoint the controller to help the Police Department change working practices and connected with her training program.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard oral hearing on the request to suspend the case.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Court of Appeal has said about the need to remove judges because she violated the Code of Conduct for United States judges and not with the need to avoid the demonstrations of bias, in part because of a series of interviews to the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, without referring to black and Hispanic on the program &quot;&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It has appointed an external comptroller to oversee large-scale changes, which include the reforms in the field of policies, training, and monitoring, and also agreed to launch a pilot program for testing on the body cameras in the police stations, where there is a majority of detentions.</seg>

		<seg id="15">Opponents argue that the changes will slash the morale of the police and not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary wastage of money and not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduction of the number of police officers on several thousand over the last decade.</seg>

		<seg id="2">He stated during a conversation with readers of his page on the &quot;Facebook&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">I can definitely say that prices are determined by many factors, among which there, including customs duties.</seg>
		<seg id="4">So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on free trade zone, the level of customs duties on the import of goods from the EU will be reduced significantly.</seg>
		<seg id="5">And it will mean that prices must be declining.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;It is with regard to goods that come from the EU&quot;, Azarov wrote.</seg>
		<seg id="7">As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on the price will not be so direct, it will be indirect.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But, nevertheless, there should not be a rise in prices.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Therefore, the message on which lately enough appeared in our country that association with the EU is rising prices, it is not quite so, or to be more precise to say - is not as &quot;, - summed Azarov.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The federal government insists that the rescue package in the amount of $325 million for Tasmania's weakened health systems will be supplemented with severe conditions which ensure that the state does not spend money wasted.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tania announced that the Commonwealth takes &quot;urgent measures &quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The decision on funding over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie declared.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems facing the state, &quot; Ms. said today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A package of $325 million includes $31 million on the planned operations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and surgery to remove cataracts, will help to overcome a backlog.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There is also money for hospitals that accept patients without reservation, in Hobart, and to improve the quality of care after in-patient, training medical professionals, mental health services and systems implementation of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;This investment will go on advanced doctors expressed their ideas about how best to help Tasmania's health system, &quot; said Ms..</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will operate in the mode of strict reporting and accountability.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive cash of the Commonwealth, and monthly report about where he spends these additional funds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Commission will be created from three people to make sure the state provides services like can be more efficient and more effective.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will solve nothing, &quot;if behind them does not follow a genuine reform which would put the health care system Tasmania on a more sustainable basis. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless, he praised the government for a response to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first turned to the prime minister in early May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I hope that the package of federal aid will greatly facilitate the conclusion of the health care system this state from critical condition, &quot; said Mr Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the state government, these additional selective treatments largely compensate for recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But federal opposition health spokesman Peter believes that today's announcement represents a similar &quot;solution &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason we are here is that the state Labor government had hurled $430 million from the health system&quot;, he told ABC TV broadcasters.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When the government of the state of lifting nearly half a billion dollars, and Commonwealth invests 300 million, you cannot pretend that this is good news.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says Obama has allowed Republicans to reduce not commendable efforts.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Obstructionism cannot serve as justification for the problems with the site of Obama &quot; s health care system, drone attacks</seg>
		<seg id="4">Memoirs of the Obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second course of the medical faculty at Harvard University.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I thought that this book will inspire me in times of gloom on the second year of medical faculty and restore in me a sense of hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;insolence for victory &quot;, and that memoirs about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I finish in the evening to write reports on my patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when the policy had inspired millions of people, and performances could capture the spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The electoral victory was formidable, and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historical moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates crying from joy, and my parents who guarded all newspapers, which only they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The White House had come a young team of strategists, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During the accession of Obama to office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This represents a return to the rude awakening, as from a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">During the years that have passed since I dropped his first ballot, the changes actually occurred.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was that I could not even imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I give Obama credit for its large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on available medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot;, killing Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health and the closure of the base in Guantanamo, among others.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after innumerable number of times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I have ended with the explanation that I can provide.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I have reached the point of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Republican obstructionism could not explain permission for foreign leaders or strikes on innocent children in other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He could not explain collecting data about the private lives of Americans, the National Security Agency or the persecution of the misconduct of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He could not explain the murder of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi without trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that included White House efforts to silence the media, are &quot;the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And lately, he could not justify what cannot develop a simple Web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on available medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I don't know that I would expect.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Whether I was at the age of 18 years to understand that leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede him?</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is obvious that work on an elective office is not a predictable programme of action, because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and random events, such as the carnage in Newtown.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Nevertheless, for all listed me above examples shows that they were largely his own choice of the administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And that is what bothers me the most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney was a strange and gross alternative, it seemed that he is not in a position to make a decision on their own policies or views.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I believed that in his second term Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections meets hope, about which we have heard for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, when this week, Obama &quot; s approval rating fell below 45 per cent return in 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me pine for many promises that.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton was deafening, Obama defeated in the primary election in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At the meeting on the analysis of the reasons of failures, he told his employees that they must go back to normal and remain faithful to its purpose.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want we returned our appeal&quot;, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;We must remember about who we are. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="42">It has been five years, Mr President, and I totally agree with you.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office, but the day of his triumph is unlikely to be the end of a political struggle in Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt &quot; when making oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, having replaced Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He took the oath before 18 judges in black in court on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, &quot; Morsi said during a ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability, &quot; said Morsi, 60th engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, the fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization, the target for tough action which changed each other governments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived with a small shortly after 11 a.m. local time.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential fanfare since Mubarak, the movement was stopped only for a short period of time to miss it on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Although Morsi ridiculed as &quot;spare wheel &quot;&quot; Brothers &quot;, his personal prestige has soared since his victory and a speech Friday, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who want to bring to the end of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak &quot; s authoritarian rule.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state, &quot; Morsi said, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges in the wooden panels hall where he took the oath of office.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to pronounce his speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He was to be provided the official reception with army orchestra, the national anthem during which he stood on the &quot;quiet. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi attended military figure.</seg>
		<seg id="14">His arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot;the army and the people are one hand&quot; who chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s, became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising began, Mubarak &quot; s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, which his office was deprived of the military council that has made the case against the ousted leader.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But by agreeing to take the oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is carrying out the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Morsi &quot; s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatre populist gestures.</seg>

		<seg id="8">Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael said he was &quot;there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence&quot;, insisting that the school final examinations will be &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">Research shows that English schools devote less time mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours per week in the quarter) than in most countries.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For comparison - the Australian schools give an average of 143 hours per year, and in Singapore, pupils are engaged about 138 hours.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Although the formal requirements to spend more time in the schedule of mathematics would not be, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school final examinations in mathematics, in combination with an increased coefficient table ratings, will likely provide an incentive for granting schools additional training on this subject.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the curriculums, more attention will be paid to the tasks of the &quot;real life &quot;, including financial mathematics.</seg>

		<seg id="2">According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the protection of the Constitution, Germany &quot; s domestic intelligence service (), his assignment was to photograph the roof of the building representations of the United States, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">German media say that hoped to discover the intelligence listening devices, and these actions led to the negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James, the director of national intelligence in the United States, in September, again assured that the United States will not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee, had become - began to publish your Treasury US intelligence secrets, European governments and executives no longer sure whether to trust the director on the word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in the cloud services providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of corporations by the observation of the state, to new heights.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The last straw was the news that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel &quot; s auditioned, probably about ten years.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, are potential targets and business leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden made an obvious intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the United States and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I think it is quite likely that this data is used for mutual benefit.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Germany must wake up&quot;, said Oliver Grün, the president of the Association, which represents small and medium-sized IT-company in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="12">German companies believe the US now poses almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July consulting agency.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In all the documents, uncovered by Mr., nevertheless, so far there was no evidence that the United States passed the trade secrets of foreign companies in their own companies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks a certain possibilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that he should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Businessmen are skeptical of this.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Someone in the German Parliament says that we must create a Google.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I can just close your eyes and open them slowly again ...</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;This is not an option, &quot; says the president of the German company's SAP software for business.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry does not have to allow her to die over 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">All except the IT industry.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And yet the scope and the technical development of US espionage agencies, which became famous thanks to the revelations, was a shock for some companies who had previously thought that the greatest risk of exposure is China.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A big shift is happening in cloud technologies, where leaders of European companies better realized that data stored in the United States, are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to the study, carried out by the trade association of Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-American actors have abandoned plans to use the services of a cloud provider based in the United States after revelations of American data mining program for Prism.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Jim, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: &quot;We are seeing that consumers are asking a new question, which has not occurred a year ago, namely: where my data is stored and whether you can ensure that they remain physically in this jurisdiction. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many German leaders argue that the last message - this is just confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and, therefore, such data should be protected at all costs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">What is the economic espionage is not surprising.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He always had a place.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;This has been a subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate, &quot; says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company BASF.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Americans spying for us on the commercial and industrial level, and we are behind them, because it is in our national interests, protect our commercial enterprises.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast of the retaliation they have taken, as it could provide an advantage to the enemy.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In large companies has long been thought that take free USB drive at the exhibition or leave your laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least imprudently.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Ulrich, a member of the board of directors of car company Audi, says that for many years it was standard practice - collect mobile phones before board meetings, so they could not be used as a device.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The Federal Office for the protection of the Constitution, Germany recommends that managers of companies consider using simple pre-paid mobile phones during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Prepaid mobile phones discarded later.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Nevertheless, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to and surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Germany, many of these companies are leaders in the global market in their particular niche.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources in order to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access&quot;, warns the report.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The United States warn their own companies about economic espionage from other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="40">National intelligence summary of the US in February placed France along with Israel and Russia in the second series of offenders, who are responsible for the economic intelligence, after China, says the Washington Post.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when talking about economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst of all. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="42">Bernard, a former head of the French domestic intelligence agency reportedly said in an interview this month: &quot;services know perfectly well that all countries, even when they co-operate in the fight against terrorism, spying on its allies. &quot;</seg>

		<seg id="3">Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was &quot;delighted &quot; by the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The first stage will be to build a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">When the second phase is completed, the line will be built in Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In June, the government has revised estimated the cost of building the high-speed line between London and the North of England with £32.7% to £42.6 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, appointed HS2 Ltd to further improve the capacity of the railway and the reduction in the length of trips to northern England and Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This should include the ability to overcome the path from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our aim for HS2 - to create a truly national network, which will make the UK and its cities closer together. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">We develop HS2 because the benefits that it brings, are enormous.</seg>

		<seg id="14">On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown has called Mr. &quot;unequivocally &quot; support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Brown said: &quot;high speed railway has all chances to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but adds the economic weight of Scotland in the general argument for high-speed railroad across the UK. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">Therefore, we are pleased to work in partnership with the UK government to review options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and the continuation of the railway line of Glasgow - Edinburgh, which are already planning Scottish government.</seg>

		<seg id="4">What is the Rosbalt</seg>
		<seg id="5">JSC &quot;informational agency&quot; was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In subsequent years, the agency has opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since 2001, Rosbalt evolved and functioned as an information federal agency.</seg>
		<seg id="9">By the mid 2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media source in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the same time, Rosbalt has always held a rather specific niche: the nucleus of exclusive agency publications were (and are still) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.</seg>

		<seg id="2">With the IMF negotiations about the loan, but another EU official directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At the same time, in addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can get 610 million euros from the European Union.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Analysts polled by Reuters, doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about the conditions of financing.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Do not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to receive aid, and the international rating agency S &amp; P on Friday, Ukraine &quot; s sovereign rating by one notch, to &quot;B-&quot; from &quot;B&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">However, EU officials say the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In addition to the plan of financial support to the country, the EU has a fallback option for ensuring the supply of gas, the majority of whom now comes from Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Perhaps it will be a gas from the &quot;Nord Stream&quot; or reverse from Slovakia.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The latter, according to officials, is the most feasible and acceptable manner in the case of Russia &quot;isolating Ukraine&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Analysts believe that this way of reverse supplies to Ukraine can only be used within a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a reduction in supply to other regions.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;between EU countries and Ukrainians are held talks about how to create favourable conditions to Ukraine could import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes&quot;, added the source Reuters.</seg>

		<seg id="4">The destruction of the stockpile of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by the middle of 2014.</seg>

		<seg id="6">International inspectors went to Syria after on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August in the chemical attack were killed, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The main task of the inspectors did not lose time - to prevent the Syrian authorities to produce more - and destroy infrastructure for mixing chemicals and munitions depots.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George: the gap with Europe gives choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another about independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, we warn that an independent Scotland should join the European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It's the stories about passport control at the border with barbed wire along the shaft.</seg>
		<seg id="4">True, the newspaper pointed to possible economic benefits from the more liberal movements in the rest of Europe, though - that predictably - it has not appeared in headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nobody does not also pointed out that the EU Member States spend a lot of time to rotate their formal rules as it is convenient.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Because Scotland now is not a member of the Schengen zone, continued non-compliance with the requirements will become cheap concession for Brussels in return for what he really wanted from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So it is not one worthy of attention.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And so old that she has become a descriptive of a hard: I first heard &quot;duck &quot; about what&quot; independence means passport control &quot; at least 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the ancient tales.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why does an independent Scotland should execute orders in Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here is a real European news: the great postwar plan to unite Europe finally stalled.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the project &quot;Europe &quot; is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Across the European Union Party, opposed to the EU, or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency, gaining strength.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, &quot;euro-skeptics party Alternative for Germany &quot; - founded only this year - appeared from nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the September federal election, thus displacing essentially&quot; free Democrats &quot; (the equivalent of our &quot;liberal Democrat &quot;) from the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There was always an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the current economic crisis became a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the common currency have led many people to believe that &quot;Europe &quot; has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The euro crisis is connected with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits - it was true only for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In fact, blocked its members on exchange rates, profitable for German exporters, is that German politicians and want to preserve.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is at a disadvantage in production capacities in comparison with Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only remedy is to cut wages and public spending that are actively supported by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">For the current budget problems and exchange worth the deeper problem of the productive capacities of Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of measures to &quot;green &quot; energy introduced Brussels - cipher, which means subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas than in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This unfavorable price terms, as we have already seen in.</seg>
		<seg id="26">No freezing wages in the world would not stop overwhelming victory of cheap shale gas in the United States over European petrochemical industry.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a level with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy of Europe, leaving the destroyed economy of France in distress.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result - right, acting against the EU party Marine Le Pen of the National Front, has just won the decisive run-off election by discarding the ruling Party of Socialists into third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;The front line &quot; is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour about how we should proceed from the assumption that the rift among the right-wing automatically have an impact in favor of the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen with their newly inherited popularity among French white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If - and this is very likely - opposed to EU parties will receive support in these elections, the bloc will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here is my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe merge together to destroy the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but he again becomes something of a vague &quot;Europe (sovereign) nations, &quot; which like General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and several of her dependent economies can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I assume that Britain distances himself from the project, hoping to get closer to the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless, the growing interest from Washington to the Pacific Ocean indicates the likelihood that Britain will be left without attention in cold Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In what position it leaves Scotland?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to become a region (essentially) of England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send in Berlin and Brussels to hell in a handbasket.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland can succeed in the freer European agreement provided that we will keep its currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other nations will be easier in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is - ironically - the most successful political movement in Europe, and against the austerity measures, which received a majority of votes in 2011 due to objections against spending cuts, proposed and implemented) Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Aleister and subsequently the coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Scotland would be ludicrous now to vote for independence, only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="1">And Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white, research shows.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes do not mean that puberty close</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals to blame</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the launch mechanisms of early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is not so expressed boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Whether the mother whether to be frightened if her daughter begin to form the beginnings of breast and pubic hair grow at 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, a children's doctor, Paul explained that these early physical changes is quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time, calming parents - usually it does not mean rapid onset of the full sexual maturity, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts and pubic hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But it was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first period) over the last four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age of 12.5 years and declined when compared with 12,75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;After chest begins to develop, is at least two to three years before menarche &quot;, - said, is also the author of&quot; early puberty in girls: how to cope with this widespread problem. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate check of how sexual maturation will prosper.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is debate about what constitutes an offensive sexual maturity, but is considered &quot;premature &quot; when breast augmentation has been accompanied by a sharp rise in growth to 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process will slow or be - that is what the pediatrician can monitor carefully.</seg>
		<seg id="17">More rapid progress can serve as the basis for analyses, to prevent serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which ultimately can lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Cautious with drugs, but admits that &quot;the suppression of puberty might mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">Another big problem is clear: parents simply do not want to have their very young daughters were menstruation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or even how they cope with hygiene issues, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock, &quot; recalls one woman, the daughter of a menstrual period started in 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="25">While there were signs, and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She came home from school, fearful and broken because it first among his friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Boys - as well as girls, puberty begins earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Argues that the premise, which has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Globally, on early puberty, apparently affects everything from economic conditions and climate change to genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another mystery: Although boys hair on the face and to appear at younger ages, a trend towards total early sex it is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other physicians participating in the Conference of the AAP, confirmed the complexity of this theme.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The emergence of pimples and pubic hair occurs even in infants and children of nursery age.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty, &quot; said Dr. Laurence Silverman, kids in the hospital in the town of Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;It may mean an earlier than expected, conversation, &quot; he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you keep calm, your child normally reacts well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls who blossom early, we need proof that even when it happens early, this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="0">John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that U.S. spying &quot;gone away &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">John Kerry has demonstrated moderation tactics to protect U.S. tracking programs, making an unprecedented acknowledgment that in some cases, US spying &quot;gone far. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Secretary also admitted that guilty, along with Barack Obama, that has been &quot;on autopilot &quot; during the appearance of the high-profile Edward revelations about the alleged spying activities of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="3">These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Speaking via video link on open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: &quot;There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government actually took some of the things on autopilot, because that possibility already existed - and during the second world war, and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, September 11. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Then he became the first senior member of the government of the United States to recognize that U.S. spying has gone too far, but stressed that ties the rights were not violated.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;In some cases this has come far.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and to communicate to people, and now conducts a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has the feeling of abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I assure you, abuse of innocent people in the process, no. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good intentions and that its tracking operations have saved many lives.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: &quot;We are working in a new world, where people are ready to blow up himself.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the world there is radical extremism, and very determined to kill people, blowing up people and attacking the government.</seg>
		<seg id="12">And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We actually prevent crashing planes, explosions of buildings and killing people because we were able to learn more about these plans in advance. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers in Europe to help resolve issues associated with the alleged U.S. espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism measures with the United States, said the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy said he talked with members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats to suspend participation in the anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with the persecution of the National Security Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;For US national security interests are really important to Europeans remained our supporters in respect of our joint counter-terrorism efforts&quot;, said Democrat Murphy, working in the office of the first term and is the chairman of the international relations of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">- and I go to Europe, to give them to understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">News that the NSA collected millions of records of telephone calls in Europe worsen relations with some allies of the United States, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that collected NATO allies and which they shared with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In other quoted released documents showing that the NSA continued monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phones around 34 other world leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Director of National Intelligence James defended the spy activities in respect of allies as necessary and said that it is commonplace on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Against the backdrop of this hype, Murphy said his office organizes trip members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation will consist of members of both parties and both houses.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The names of the other participating legislators should be voiced in the coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">According to him, the tour program is still under development.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Although Murphy said that the goal of the trip is to improve relations, he said that some degree of hardness &quot;well-meaning &quot; will also is manifested.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He said that European leaders must be honest with his people in what spyware programs they have used for many years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;While we can change our tracking programme, in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who are engaged in intelligence activities, &quot; said Murphy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should head into this weekend in the Middle East and in Poland for solving the problems of hostility against the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as intelligence activity in the United States.</seg>

		<seg id="10">Women no longer need to be from sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, for example, or pizza.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As for the men, I think we will see a lot of thanks to the &quot;zombie &quot;, and I am confident that astronauts in the style of the band Daft Punk will get in our tapes 11 this year.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Google, the costumes, which are most often is zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>

		<seg id="23">This is about 9 billion individual corn.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Although she's earning $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, a monthly family income is not enough, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, the demand in various parts of Southeast Asia - where the debt of households is growing - is that, where she conducts her deal this week became the third registered on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Credit under pledge of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms.), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Usually there are pawnbrokers in Singapore, an effective annual interest rates at 17 percent - slightly above the 15.4% offered in the United Overseas Bank, a local lender, with a branch in the same shopping center.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or evidence of wage and can give loans faster than banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers, because families are feeling the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of robust growth, following the global financial crisis, and cheap credit, loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers to offset a reduction in profits as the slowing growth of their economies.</seg>

		<seg id="12">Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, compared with 60% in 2008.</seg>

		<seg id="19">In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops saw growth in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.</seg>

		<seg id="22">While some lenders have sparked the fire of criticism because of high interest rates, Ms Lombard says that not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase the debt directly.</seg>

		<seg id="1">While the American designers roads trying to find money to repair highways system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, neatly on the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">These devices, tracking every mile and transmit this information to officials, are at the center of the controversial attempts to modernize the antiquated system of financing the highways of America organized routine bodies of Washington state.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Usually boring arena planning highways suddenly has generated intense debate and picturesque alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the government for the rights of small to track the number of miles you and even, perhaps, where you drive them, &quot;and then use this information when drawing up the tax bills.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Tea Party movement shocked.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Although Congress until may agree to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They ponder how over the next decade, you can go to the system, under which drivers pay for each mile road, which they can ride.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists had taken on the testing of these black boxes, some of which have a function of satellite tracking.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is really necessary for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;This is not an issue on which we have may be the right choice, &quot; said Hassan, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which prepares plans to start tracking the state authorities miles every Californian, by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology to do this already exists.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The need for this is aggravated by a lack of funds from the government fund the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay for.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Americans have been buying as much gasoline as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars passing more miles per gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, has not appreciated for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians do not want to raise tax on even one penny with high prices for gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;A tax on gasoline simply impossible to maintain, &quot; said Lee, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In his state was recently installed on the cars 500 tracking devices for testing the system of payment.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;It would be the best option in the long run, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The beggar call this user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Not surprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, because with the help of taxes can be changed the nature of travel for reducing the load of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The authorities in California could be waiting for this system in the development of strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But a Republican member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (Pa), chairman of the transportation committee of the Chamber of Commerce, said that he, too, sees the system as the most viable long-term alternatives.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Proponents of the free market in the fund &quot;reason &quot; is also delighted from what drivers would pay for each mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not just a tax that will go into a black hole, &quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs of reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People directly pay for what they receive.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This movement is also supported by two former transport ministers of the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of the payment.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The US Senate approved last year a pilot project at a cost of 90 million dollars, which would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of fears of rural legislators representing voters whom in everyday life often come many miles to get to work or to the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">A few states and cities, nevertheless, go on this path independently.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The greatest enthusiasm is manifested in Oregon, where to participate in the largest experiment in the country held 5,000 drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon be paying staff for miles driven instead of the gasoline tax.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Nevada, a pilot project has been completed.</seg>
		<seg id="36">He is seen in New York.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois it on a limited basis involving trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes transportation departments 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, and Florida), studying how they can spend these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This concept has not received universal acceptance.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were worried that the government can track their every step.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;concern about&quot; big brother &quot;and similar things represents a big problem, &quot; said Khan, head of the issues of strategy and performance management in the Department of Transport in Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It was not what people wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When the tests were underway, a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: &quot;will be very easy to convert these devices into full-fledged tracking devices. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be extended for the storage of records about everyday movements of individual citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of several states where we are soul searching low-cost technology that would have allowed state authorities to engage in accounting driving miles, but no information about the place and time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you can do it, &quot;said Khan, the society will feel more relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called true.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Initially, the company has been attempting to collect state taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She sought to enter the booming market of automobile insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the device, which it began testing, attract designers roads because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloadable via modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People are more inclined to do it if you do not track their speed and do not track their location, &quot; said Ryan Morrison, executive director of true.</seg>
		<seg id="52">There were several big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There is much less expensive and less recurring ways to do it.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Cardinals are the senior clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they elect popes, so Francis will appoint its first group of people who eventually will participate in the choice of his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Currently there are 201 Cardinal.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, after the Cardinal 80th age he can no longer take part in the election of the Pope - this is a prerogative of the group &quot;120 &quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis has decided to inform us of their decision to convene in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from all over the world&quot;, said Lombardi.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices, &quot; said that by February, the number is likely to fall.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He said that usually the Pope calls cardinals as much as necessary to again bring the number to 120, as well as many Cardinals over the age of 80 years as he chooses.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The next year will be very important because it will be the first since the election of Francis, in March of this year, according to Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.</seg>

		<seg id="12">Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are insignificant number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It will also be the first selected Cardinals since the formation of the Council of Cardinals Francis - the group of eight cardinals from around the world, which is to seek ways of reforming the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past, the Pope all solved independently.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now, Francis chose eight cardinals to help him&quot;, Valero said.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He said that it was &quot;quite possible &quot; that Francis will turn to for advice.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But we have not been in this situation before that - all this for us for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said the pope is usually built in the position of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis &quot;full of surprises - however we do not know whom he named. &quot;</seg>

		<seg id="25">The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first - cutting the time of transplant, secondly - convenience.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Above all, the opportunity to change the type of transport, not going out in the rain.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Moscow the same arrangement of TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A vivid example of the &quot;VDNH&quot; metro station.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Earlier, commuter buses with Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance of the exhibition.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Now their stops were postponed to the opposite side of the street of cosmonauts.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Farther from the subway, much further from, but closer to residential homes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The gift that residents do not want bus under Windows and complained in every possible instance.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Capital TPU in Moscow is somehow not immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The first of them started five years ago at Metro &quot;Planernaya&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The project was designed to be a model.</seg>
		<seg id="36">And it really is a sample of how interchange node, left to investors, turns into a banal shopping mall.</seg>
		<seg id="37">No, there is for buses, Canopy not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.</seg>
		<seg id="38">True, No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU places gave no brand.</seg>
		<seg id="39">As strangers they pushed them away from the Metro.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But space under trade more left.</seg>
		<seg id="41">One of only 32 clothing store, but generally there is almost everything - from pet products to the showroom.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Well, in fact, suddenly from bus passengers who need to buy a new car on the road?</seg>
		<seg id="43">We have when they build overhaul TPU, somehow always turns out shopping mall.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion when part of the car parks decided to give at the market.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Now, on the third floor of the TPU &quot;Planernaya&quot; among the floor parking spaces is trade.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, not Russian speech and guards, glinting on our photographer.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Interchange knot finally turned into a bazaar.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The fact is that before the Metro &quot;Planernaya&quot; market, but it was demolished.</seg>
		<seg id="49">And in the prefecture of traffickers and everything within DUI allowed on parking node.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Anyway, owing to the high prices there is always empty.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The same funny that the market demolished in order to build in its place... new TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="52">This is castling.</seg>
		<seg id="53">The Metro &quot;Kaluga&quot; distance approach from lobby Metro bus was 50 meters, &quot;said Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="54">After the construction of the trade center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="55">To sit in the bus, you need to pass through the shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After 22 hours, when it is closed, must work around him under the open sky.</seg>
		<seg id="57">However, the &quot;design&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot; will soon seem the problem.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In mid-September, the Commission approved the mayor planning solutions for the first eight Capital TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Four of them will 25-этажными, not counting two or three underground floors.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The chief monster will grow from metro station &quot;Tushino District&quot;, there will be 418,7 thousand square metres of space.</seg>
		<seg id="61">Representatives of railway stations Directorate of Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU from Metro, have already told journalists: in future will contain shops, hotels and apartments.</seg>
		<seg id="62">At the same time, officials assure that storied parking Zay ­ Mut from one third to a half of the square.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Take for example the &quot;folk&quot; garages.</seg>
		<seg id="64">For example, the garage for 258, which recently built on the international street, has an area of 8015 square meters.</seg>
		<seg id="65">So for parking in 2.6 thousand cars, &quot;&quot; need about 80 thousand &quot;squares&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="66">This is less than a third of that which they intend to build.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Let one or two go on various floors for buses.</seg>
		<seg id="68">Remains of at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="69">And this, on the minute, almost two of gum.</seg>
		<seg id="70">If capital TPU in stations and build the railroad station, the remaining sites will develop.</seg>
		<seg id="71">They also promised that &quot;there will be a lot of functional purpose&quot;, including hotels, offices and even sports halls.</seg>
		<seg id="72">By the way, in the Moscow department of property recently, told reporters that develop the draft resolution, according to which investors would be able to apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Without any competitions.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Because, they say, that transport issues for the city - a priority.</seg>
		<seg id="75">The ideal TPU is, for example, the &quot;Harvard&quot; in Boston, or &quot;&quot; in Toronto, &quot;says Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="76">There, trolleys and trams descend under the earth on the subway and the distance from the subway car approach before the tram is only 50 metres without entering into the street.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Around no unnecessary trade.</seg>
		<seg id="78">But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.</seg>
		<seg id="79">Either nothing will build, or even 25 storeys with offices and apartments.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Corporation of Bombardier, the Canadian aircraft and train maker, reported on Thursday about the reduction of net profit by 15 per cent under the influence of a number of orders and deliveries aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Located in Montreal, Bombardier also has not published any data for flight testing of its new CSeries aircraft and provided no new information about whether implemented ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation by next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft, held approximately one and a half months ago, he was still only three times, that raises questions about whether testing phase on schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="4">No results were acquitted forecasts and led to the downfall of the shares by more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its estimate of &quot;above &quot; to&quot; restricted &quot; because of the belief that growth stocks in the next quarter or two.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Although the reduction in the number of aircraft deliveries was largely predictable, we are, of course, disappointed by the performance of profit Transport Department &quot;, - said the review of the stock market.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier gets new CSeries orders as the flight test program.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Nevertheless, if not in the coming months will be announced about new orders, we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier CSeries family of aircraft hopes will enable it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first prototype aircraft was introduced in March, and for the first time made flying in September after several months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But firm orders for the CSeries has so far not too many - 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to check the company &quot; s claims about fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Just now there are 403 15 orders and agreements with the customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Chief Executive Officer Pierre was confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders to the moment when the first plane will be launched into commercial operation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and media that the program is progressing according to plan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;A test model of the aircraft had not stayed on the ground longer than expected, &quot; he said during a conference call, adding that the downtime of the airplane were planned ground tests and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">All manufacturers plan to test differently.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We decided to spend the first flight and make a break for updates, so we did.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So will occur during the flight test program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test samples should take flight in the coming weeks, and all the others will soon follow him as the company said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Still, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first client could begin to operate the CSeries aircraft after 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said that it evaluates the commissioning and provide new information in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;The slow pace of flight testing - though, apparently, and corresponds to the domestic schedule Bombardier - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter, September 30, net income Bombardier has declined to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged - 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Gross income fell slightly - from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth largest global aircraft reported that he had put 45 aircraft in the quarter, which is less than in the previous year - 57.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 planes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Order backlog aerospace research division amounted to $32.9 billion at September 30, not re since December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In the aerospace field results were consistent with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become unpleasant factor, &quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Gross Income on direction fell by 13 percent - up to $2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world &quot; s biggest train manufacturer, reported that gross income in this sector has increased by nearly 11 per cent - up to $2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion at September 30, slightly higher than from December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The transport division income negatively impacted problems with execution of several large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Management stated that in the fourth quarter will be presented a new plan for development.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that chief financial officer Patrick Google enters the board of directors, fell 8.5 per cent - up from $4,83 at auction in the middle of Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft maker and its nearest competitor, Bombardier announced on Thursday about reducing the quarterly income by 10 percent.</seg>

		<seg id="1">You can safely argue that New York is a place of birth in America: almost 100 years ago the amateur artist Frank Fay, who served as entertainer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the public in a manner of speaking.</seg>

		<seg id="5">We created this festival as a way to continue to work with them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This year, the event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as stand-up comedy for &quot;Heroes &quot; - an annual charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where there will be among other Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.</seg>

		<seg id="11">And Krall and slate, like other young the comedians with original style (pessimistic Anthony, the crafty, focused on racial themes Mau Bell) - this is the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>

		<seg id="13">Steinberg started as, but then he became a successful director on television and in the movies, as well as unofficial historian of comedy.</seg>

		<seg id="15">The meeting will be held in the town hall in downtown Manhattan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;This city is surely the central element of the whole work, Larry, &quot; Steinberg said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told me that coming here, he sometimes walks on a street between the two houses and thinking: &quot;What if I stay totally without money, perhaps, I will live here. &quot;</seg>
