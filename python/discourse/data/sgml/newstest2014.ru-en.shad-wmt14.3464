		<seg id="1">The survivors and relatives of the 202 died as a result of the bombing in Bali in 2002, angrily reacted to the verdict of the last of the plotters, who appeared in court, and said that Umar Patek should be shot.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in south-east Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for his role in creating explosive devices, used during the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He could be freed within 15 years, if will receive parole.</seg>
		<seg id="4">45-year-old defendant was convicted in the mass killings as a result of the attack on two night club in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including in a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that the man nicknamed &quot;Demoman&quot; for his reputation of the Wizard for making explosives, should be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision deepened the painful memories of the mother of Perth June of Cortina who lost their 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Barely restraining his tears, she said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He must appear before a firing squad, &quot; said Ms. Cortina AAP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer be grandchildren and I don't see my daughters.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="14">After the attack he fell into a coma for a month and &quot;died&quot; three times, being connected to the life-support system.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiah, responsible for the carnage-Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam of Samudra who were executed four years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Get 20 years after killed 202 people and wounded hundreds-it is not so much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the participants of the terrorist attack in Bali, were tried before a court.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He was hiding for nearly 10 years, but in the end was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where American troops killed the former leader of al-Qaida Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the trial an FBI agent showed that data intelligence testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore the link between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;He didn't give up,&quot; said Ms. Cortina.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he has caused to other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The sentence imposed in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;This year there will be a lot of tears,&quot; says Ms. Cortina.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The manufacturers of jet aircraft feud about the width of the seats at stake in large orders</seg>
		<seg id="1">Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft was a bitter dispute about the width of a tourist class seats on long flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Literary dispute around the width of the seats available to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class, whose interests are not always in the spotlight of the airlines, with the amount allocated to them space plays a key role in the claims about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft, Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for the introduction of industry standard that would seat width of no less than 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class, but its main U.S. rival, Boeing says that it must solve the airline.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales all larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21 expected potentially record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The design of the rear of the plane-especially, whether sitting 9 or 10 people in a row-occupies a central place in the statements about economic efficiency of new projects &quot;mini-aircraft.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing argues that its new 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on the seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed 10 in each row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says that its competing version of the A350 will be transported in the economy class, 350 people on the seat width of 18 inches, located on nine in a row.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Giants aircraft often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the show in Dubai, where the 777X, is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">She recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers a slide showing three people in the restaurant, pressed to each other, under the name &quot;would you agree on this?.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John dashing.</seg>
		<seg id="12">With the change of diet people gain weight, but aircraft seats cardinal has not changed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970's, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards of modern travel, and the turn of the century the weight of the average American men between the ages of 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the Department of Health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A waist circumference of middle-American men of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistical data, in the health service.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus says that its competitor to the concept of the seat of the 1950s, when the average waist circumference, recently called &quot;reactive audience,&quot; was already.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus says that ordered the study attesting that extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputed Airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.</seg>
		<seg id="18">According to her, studies show that the convenience of salon depends not only on the width of the seats.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It really boils down to providing airline of choice and the ability to do that in their opinion they should make for success,&quot; said specialist Boeing on the salons Kent Craver.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They don't want us to have decided for them, that will bring them profits.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it increasingly becomes a factor that can affect profits.</seg>
		<seg id="23">This dispute is the race for orders for the planes, estimated at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades-enough to change the relationship between American and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As first reported in July, the Reuters news agency, the location of the seats is what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest jet aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing say about 20-percent increase in profitability at one place in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The characteristics of the Boeing based in part on comparing 10-seat rows 777X with original 9-seater layout rows of constructive solutions 777.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Under looking down upon them by the statue of Samora Machel, president-founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo, to chant slogans about the world on one of the rare here demonstrations.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want the return of the world; we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousse, executive director of the investment.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Fearing for the future of their country, she swapped business attire on a T-shirt decorated with the words &quot;We demand security&quot; in Portuguese, and were joined on Thursday by the crowd on Independence Square.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Within two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and the Renamo is one of the most violent clashes since the conclusion of the truce more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Renamo once was known rebel movement, which was at first by the white government of Rhodesia, and then by the government of South Africa of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the government of an independent country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After the Armistice in 1992 it became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again plunge into full-scale conflict, but recent events made me nervous foreign investors and local residents.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in north-west could raise more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling party's Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and the party of Renamo accuse each other in the tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Party Renamo argues that the government was a ringleader of the latest clashes, attacking its members in the province of copal, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo, on October 17.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The attack on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked base Renamo and attempted to kill the Afonso Dhlakama-the leader of the group, told the newspaper the Financial Times Fernando Masing, Representative Renamo.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government blames the Renamo in triggering clashes, accusing the party on the attack on the soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The President Armando Guebuza has tried to allay fears of instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Gebuza told AFP, the French news agency Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt &quot;a loser,&quot; THEhotel to use &quot;all that is left of his power to try to prove that he can impose the government's own decisions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">As the Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But concerns have grown after reports that the Mazar said about the refusal of Renamo from the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the Financial Times that meant failure of the agreement by the party Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but in all seriousness,&quot; said Mazar.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The previous negotiations between the parties has done little to defuse the crisis, which has a series of clashes this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;This is two influential person (Guebuza and Dhlakama), a freewheeling foreheads, &quot; said Joseph Hanlon, Lecturer of the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to go on the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Party Renamo, which tries to bring about electoral reform, has already said that it will boycott the municipal elections, scheduled for November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators interpreted it as an attempt to pressure weakened the movement to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The share of votes for the Renamo decreases since 1992, while the new party-the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former member of Renamo, is expected to improve their performance on these elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr Mazar says that Mr. Guebuza, who must step down next year, when ends his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he did not want a transparent election, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the presidency,&quot; said Mazar.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear what capability the Renamo, but it has already made rapid and devastating attacks on police stations and cars on a key motorway leading from the north to the south.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the clashes took place in the province of sofa, which is located just a few hundred kilometers to the north of Maputo, but includes the Beira port, which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export the coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio has suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo has threatened an attack on the railroad.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The Matang was evasive when he asked the question, I repeat Li Renamo this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The party Renamo wanted &quot;to warn the international community about what matters in Mozambique does not go very well,&quot; said Mazar.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability has intensified popular discontent with the government, and many people also care about corruption, the slow pace of development and recently increased kidnappings, &quot; says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that the responsibility for the future of the country are the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultan, demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Nobody cares about the Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want the resumption of the world, they want access to the roads,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists shed light on how the tail of dogs are associated with her mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier research has shown that happy dogs by strings in the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while the alarmed dogs Palaguachi tail mainly in the left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other members of the family dog may notice these subtle differences in vilenie tail and respond to them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from Trotsky University, says: &quot;It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain differently are involved in the formation of the stimulators that generate positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we have tried to look at this and other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that, like humans, dogs have the right-hand side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs react to the versatile Povilionis tails of other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the frequency of heartbeat animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes going in one direction and sometimes in another</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have shown the dogs video with dogs-or naturalistic version, or a silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we were able to manipulate the motion of the tail and send the tail more left or right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When they saw that otherwise nothing expresses the dog had driven the tail right (from the point of view of wagging her tale dogs), they remained completely relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they noticed that the tail was left bent mainly (again from the point of view of wagging her tale dogs), their heart rate was more frequent and they looked alarmed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professor Vallortigara said that he doesn't think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from her experience, what movements they should worry, and what is not.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He says: &quot;If several meetings with other dogs and often Melanie their tail in one side is associated with more friendly behavior, while the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on that experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that these results may give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of emotions his animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Expert in the field of behavior of Dogs by John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the veterinary school at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to test whether a value for dogs left and right side.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln have found that dogs turn your head to the left, if you look at an aggressive dog, and right, if you look at happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in other scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot; Dogs often approached the dog-robot when Melanie her tail was left, not right, rather than to become alarmed, &quot; opposite behavior towards Italian study.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceived animals in films or dogs-robots as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Could be useful in the study of how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;While the various mammals there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Whether the elite of Europe to do business with England?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the obligation to bring together representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in the relationship with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">With this purpose we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK business and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a broad slice of the business in the UK, sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found out that the vast majority of companies are now looking for opportunities for exports outside Europe, paying special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are in stagnation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want a government that gave priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reform of EU institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to laws of products, most business leaders believed that control these key spheres of competence should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives argued that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits from being in the trade zone of Europe, agreed with this even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European-minded of all the companies.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The last and most revealing-our poll of business leaders found that a clear majority wants the UK led to a change of the treaty and on relations with the EU, based on trade, not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This result, which was observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on &quot;meaningful change&quot; that will return the powers back to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are high-achieving changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide 16-percent shift in voting to remain in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The prime minister should not be any doubt: This poll shows that the British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain's EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that the business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The best conditions for British business and become more and more necessary as the eurozone is on a path toward closer economic and financial integration.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority should be jobs and growth in the UK, and shows the results of our survey, for business this means and focusing on trade and fundamental changes in regulatory activity of Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="15">In terms of our realities are imposed heavy demands on the food.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In order not to freeze, you need increased calorie.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;If people limit themselves on pet products, respectively, this calorie helps,&quot; says a specialist.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Agree with that doctor-nutritionist Olga OSCE.</seg>
		<seg id="19">She adds that imported fruits and vegetables-not a way.</seg>

		<seg id="43">&quot;The apples are brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and Lesnevich, tasteless tomatoes and neuropathy,&quot; cites examples of the medic, adding that they probably are excessive amounts of fertilizer.</seg>
		<seg id="44">And become the suppliers not vitamins, and fiber.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Don't agree with it, the Siberian Salaberria Physico-Technical Institute of Agrarian Issues, Candidate of Agricultural Sciences faith Petruk.</seg>
		<seg id="46">She says that with the right approach, and observance of all standards and requirements in greenhouses may be growing full of vegetables.</seg>
		<seg id="47">If you try to expel more square meter, then, of course, and water will be more likely to overfeed plants mineral fertilizers.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Attempts to solve transport problems major cities were observed in most cities around the world since the second half of the 20th century.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As a rule, it was either about their rebuilding and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and the time of their use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A widely-known example of Singapore, where imposed strict quotas to increase the number of private cars, and the right of their purchase bought at auction.</seg>
		<seg id="4">His price may be two to three times more than the price of the car itself.</seg>
		<seg id="5">European cities, including London, have introduced fee for entry into the centre of the city.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called Green Zone, where allowed entry only cars with a certain access using the fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric vehicles).</seg>
		<seg id="7">The agency for the protection of the environment of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012, &quot;five-year plan of clean air&quot; worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).</seg>
		<seg id="8">According to Kommersant, director of the Department of Pollution Control transport Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection of Beijing whether Kunsheng, the main aim of the five-year plan-the reduction of air pollutants 20-35% by 2017, the increase of the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (5.2 million), as well as increase no more than 5% of the fuel in one vehicle.</seg>

		<seg id="10">Among the main measures of the program-the restriction of the use of motor transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Among other things, the city's measure of &quot;green five-year plan &quot; include faster compared with the rest of the country in the transition to the euro standards fuel, the introduction of the local system of EastEnders and labelling of cars and fuel, restricting entry of cars in the central part of the city, the ban on the use of outdated vehicles (in addition, creating a financial incentive programs to replace the old cars to hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and official), development of public transport (including high-speed).</seg>

		<seg id="0">The trip on dirt, rivers and jungles to provide free medical aid</seg>
		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In this West African country doctors not so much-just one in 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Cast your vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him or any of the other top 10 Heroes, so he became a CNN Hero of the year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This man will receive $250,000 to continue their outstanding work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father was coming back to life and was again fall into an unconscious state, commuting to hospitals, which were not equipped properly, to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Game Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981, near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At first he had only a broken hand, but the infection has spread to the brain and caused a haematoma that looked like myself for the rest of their lives.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;In Cameroon was not neurosurgeons,&quot; said Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If we had the money, we would have took it from Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead Bwelle years was accompanied by his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment that they could get.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not easy,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;You can walk away from home at 5 a.m., to the hospital to be first, but you are not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Patients very much.</seg>
		<seg id="17">That some may die because they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation is not much has changed since then, Father Bwelle died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor for 5,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">For comparison, the ratio in the United States-one doctor on 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if the Adamaoua could go to the doctor, many of them it would be unaffordable.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the cost of health care in it are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Their only problem is poverty,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And because of the poverty they can't enjoy their life.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his countrymen, Bwelle became determined something to do.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Last year, Dr Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He also founded a non-profit organization ascovime, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday he and another 30 people clod in vans, bind to the roof with medical supplies and travel over rough terrain to visit in need of the village.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Is not always accompanies them luck.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Once, they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they come, they come across as genuine heroes: This is a holiday with songs and dances and best room, which only can suggest local residents.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Free medical care in these villages, this really is a cause for celebration, and Bwelle with his wide smile and boundless energy more than happy to join the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team starts to take hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We have 500 people on each trip,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come from all over the area within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, and diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others may receive the crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates-documents necessary for the school, which many poor families simply can't afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evenings the brigade performs simple operation under a local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operation, as a rule, are held in the building of the school, municipality or in the house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to post, to make room for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitation of processing equipment, Belle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">This unsustainable pace, but the determination of the brigade typically help to keep rural musicians.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They all night beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday members of the brigade sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">This group, consisting of Cameroonian foreign doctors and medical students, has spent 700 free operations last year, and they know that their help could have huge significance for those they help.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One man explained that he received a free operation to cure hernia will allow him to operate again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;This will change the future for me and my family,&quot; said the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to these clinical techniques on weekends and work in a hospital surgeon Bwelle also works nights in a private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">This is the second job, he said, provides 60 per cent of funding for his non-profit organizations; the rest are covered by private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I don't even know when he's asleep,&quot; said Kathy O Melli, medical student, the second year Drexelbrook University in Philadelphia, the volunteer group Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He has always either in hospital, or trying to earn money for the organization so that you can continue this campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For future doctors and nurses, such as O Melli coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle in implementation of its tasks, it is-practice that they never would have received at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We got the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped to remove the stain of blood or keep the tools for doctors bulle,&quot; said Mr. O Melli.</seg>
		<seg id="56">As a student, a sophomore, you would never have got such an opportunity in America.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The volunteers themselves usually pay for their own travel in Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But on arrival in Yaounde their meals, transport and training pays Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is a hero, without a doubt,&quot; said Mr. O Melli.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He gives his life to this organisation, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bwelle almost constant workload work is not a heavy challenge.</seg>
		<seg id="62">To help to live a happy life to others, to do this to his father promise is what brings him great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I'm so happy when you do this job,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot;And I think about my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees that I'm doing.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I do it to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Go to the site ascovime and see what you can help.</seg>

		<seg id="0">For &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in the United States has finally established a new name - &quot;The Circle&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">This week, the black list &quot; of the Russian mafia in America has been updated with new names and four companies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The US Treasury has imposed in &quot;brotherly circle&quot; of three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis.</seg>
		<seg id="3">One of the Russians proved to be a well-known singer Grigory Leps, whom the US suspect in transportation money for members of the group.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In all, the black list of 22 people, implicated in &quot;brotherly circle,&quot; and six affiliated with him.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nevertheless, many experts express doubt that it really exists.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The statement about' The past circle' looks more like an attempt to unite the fragmented criminal groups,&quot; the previously announced an expert on organized crime and professor at New York University Mark Galeotti.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In his opinion, &quot;fraternal circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of &quot;Russian mafia .&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else, who would have confirmed the existence of this criminal organization,&quot; quoted Mr Galeotti American Center for the Study of corruption and organized crime.</seg>
		<seg id="9">With Mr. Galeotti agree and professor at George Mason University Liz Shelley.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but not the organization,&quot; it quoted the words of the Center for the Study of corruption and organized crime.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti suggested that &quot;brotherly circle&quot; unites in increasingly close Russian thieves in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hassan.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The crime boss was killed in January of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="13">So, the activities of the lash Shushanashvili and Zacharias Kalashov replenishment of the list in 2012, was closely connected with his Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, had the dad Hasano nephew.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia-consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and massive cuts in workers.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The last time he entirely due to consumption, which almost does not ease the turnovers, &quot; said chief economist for Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens box, representing yesterday quarterly report of Investbank on the Russian economy.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Now the nominal wage growth in Russia-about 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="6">With inflation at 6 percent, he will be able to provide future consumer demand roughly at the current level, at Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so it is likely that they will optimize staff costs.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: If wages are rising by 10%, GDP is only 2%, &quot; said Mr Field.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The company was faced with reduced profitability.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If it will not grow, it could lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Not to raise the salaries of Russian business can't, &quot; said Barclays Capital chief economist for Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Unemployment is near historic lows, the competition for workers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">To lure employees from the side or to keep current, employers have to raise wages.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Consumption in Russia is supported and very rapid growth of PatrickDelany.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to Mr. Field, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country, this kind of lending is not.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;The benefit to the economy from growth of PatrickDelany we no saw money not diverge on the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments,&quot; said the economist.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But the problem in the other-in Goldman Sachs expect growth of arrears on unsecured loans.</seg>
		<seg id="18">These are mainly poor people who have nothing to offer in.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The interest on such loans high.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, they often do not return, &quot; said Mr Field.</seg>
		<seg id="21">So the second threat to economic growth in Russia-a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The director of banking institute HSE Vasily Solodov already sees signs of a maturing of the banking crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Small credit organizations, do not have access to cheap resources, has some of the state-owned banks, were forced to attract means from population at a high interest rate.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In response, the state-owned banks went on the warpath and began to reduce lending rates, says economist.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Small credit organization can not give loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If the state-owned banks will not abandon of dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solokov.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Deprivation of licenses of some banks in recent weeks, the economist believes the harbinger of mass crash.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;The state-owned banks with such a situation will not cope: The system of deposit insurance originally was not designed for a systemic crisis,&quot; warned the head of the Institute.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But consumption growth will slow and without crisis of non-payments, put in the investment bank, because of the refusal of indexing salaries of civil servants and the military, in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In part, the hit to consumption will be softened by the freeze tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, inflation).</seg>
		<seg id="31">But only partly: If the investments don't grow up (and preconditions to this no-see The Help), consumption growth will slow down, confidence in Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital until sees no preconditions for implementation of pessimistic scenarios.</seg>
		<seg id="33">&quot;The main risk is still the fall in oil prices,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="34">By his estimate, Russia's economy will begin to shrink with the cost of oil below $90 a barrel.</seg>
		<seg id="35">At Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is unable to lower interest rates in the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There has been a paradoxical picture: Inflation has fallen, and banks began to raise rates.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It may mean that they did not believe the central bank, declaring the transition to the targeting inflation, &quot; said Clemens column.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Interest rate policy of the central bank on market rates does not, only affects rates for interbank lending.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;For the central bank is the collapse of all hope,&quot; praised Clemens column.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Money received at auctions, the central bank, banks are not lending to the economy, and to manage their liquidity</seg>
		<seg id="41">As soon as the reduced rate, changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the rouble.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;Sooner or later, the central bank will realize that this strategy is not working,&quot; said Mr Field and reminded that to let the ruble in &quot;free swimming&quot; the state plans by the end of 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But will have to do this before, or to raise the key rate the central bank (5.5%), he says.</seg>
		<seg id="44">By his estimate, the ruble exchange rate now artificially inflated by 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Ruble only one road-to weaken, &quot; concludes the expert.</seg>
		<seg id="46">But if the central bank will Serenety in financiers even the shadow of a doubt that the elimination of currency corridor is not part of the policy by the weakening of the ruble, it can bring down the ruble is much stronger.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: &quot; Air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes (but not to call from your mobile phone)</seg>
		<seg id="1">The passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, to work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines, published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that the changes will happen immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, &quot; said FAA Administrator Michael worth at the press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Airlines will have to show the FAA, as their planes meet new guidelines and that they update their textbook for the members of the flight crew and the rules on the installation of devices to conform to the new guidelines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already unveiled plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the status of the plan we could approve the extension of the use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; said FAU.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the aircraft door closes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain will not welcome.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers must turn off their devices once again when a plane goes down for planting, and to not enable them, as long as the plane is on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes properly protected from electronic interference, can allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, said FAU.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The majority of new aircraft and other planes, modified in such a way that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;After the new policy will be safely implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier, to achieve this, it will be a safe choice, &quot; said Glading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We frankly are tired of feeling &quot;duty at school,&quot; when it comes to this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Internet connection for web browsing, e-mails, text messages or downloading data will still be banned at the height of less than 10,000 feet, according to the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in a mode of the aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thus, there is still no &quot;Words with Friends&quot; - intellectual Internet games, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was the famous incident: The actor was removed from the aircraft the airline American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the plane was at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But heavier devices, such as laptops, still will need to be in the luggage department, because they can someone to injure, if will fly across the room.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Calls from the mobile phone in flight will also still prohibited.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Regulatory authority on telephone calls to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month Mark Rosenker from the National Council on transport security, national security expert for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered at risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Cell phones-it really is a problem, not just because potentially it could create interference to navigational devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they can create interference for cell phone towers when the plane is in the air,&quot; said Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Industry advisory committee created by the FAA to study this issue, recommended last month that the government has allowed a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years, been growing pressure on the FAA with the aim of easing of restrictions on their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics, such as the Democrat senator from Missouri Claire the MacCaskill, argue that bans for no good reason related to security.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The observance of the restrictions also becomes more difficult to provide, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">FAA began to limit use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of fail for navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began to carry the FM-radio-high-tech gadgets at that time.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New airliners are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they also are being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airline to offer passengers using Wi-Fi at cruising altitude already for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The planes, modified for Wi-Fi systems, also more resistant to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, &quot; said Worth.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals a much lower power than the previous generation devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Device for reading electronic books, for example, emit only a minimal signals when switching the pages.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the signals are becoming more powerful when the device download or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among those who sought the easing of restrictions on the use by passengers of electronic devices was the company Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011 the company representatives have downloaded a airliner with their devices for reading e-books on the Kindle and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers, said that he believes interference from devices real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages pilots, confirming that the devices might be creating interference for aviation systems, and most of these messages very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA allowed the pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during the landings on the devices in poor visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them sensible step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed antinational vaccine, which could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests are needed before trials on humans, it will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the early results are encouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We very much hope that such a strategy of using vaccines can finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit, surrogate methods available in the market today, but they discovered that nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern tools,&quot; said Professor Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was designed to carry genetic information for antinational of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Selectively the virus infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Antibodies trail any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker nicotine hit.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In vaccinated mice, which subsequently gave the nicotine, continued their normal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And mice that were not given the vaccine, &quot; relaxed, &quot; and this is an indication that the nicotine to the brain, &quot; say the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">These experiments described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Previous tobacco vaccine failed, because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, the injections had to do so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it makes liver cells in the factories of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it would give the children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They will know if they start smoking again, they will not get that pleasure due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them to get rid of this habit,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that needs additional research.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for what they sneaked hand baggage on board his flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday showed that the passengers will be able to keep the entire bank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A new fee for baggage applies to bags in the overhead baggage compartments, so a small bags, placed under the seat remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said it will charge $25, if the fee is payable in advance, and $100, if travelers will pay only once at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O Melli said that cost $100 to get the passengers to take care of the payment in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We don't want to charge for it,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines have begun to charge for the first and second bag, checked in luggage, in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers trying to avoid these charges, edge so much, how many will be able, in hand baggage in the overhead baggage compartments, resulting in these compartments are not enough.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees-one of the ways to get passengers to carry less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O Melli said that this new collection, in fact, not for the sake of making money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The fact is that the most loyal customers frontier say that to find a place in the overhead baggage compartments becomes increasingly difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, will have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier flight may get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the next in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr. O Melli said that changes to procedures on the Web site and its frontier is meant to ensure that passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">A new frontier for hand baggage will not be charged until the summer, though the date is not yet set.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The passengers often complain about fees for baggage and other fees, but airlines their love.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that the processing of baggage costs money, and the passengers who need this service, need to pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street believe adding a baggage fees a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But most of them are not concerned the fees for carry-on luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. has introduced the first fee for carry-on luggage three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with this collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the additional fees.</seg>
		<seg id="22">By his estimate in the report from December 2011, the fee for carry-on baggage brings spirit $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former senior manager at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Flight spirit, and he was wondering what he will find at the gate, where the passengers will face an unusual gathering spirit for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The process of planting was the smooth of those that I have seen for his career in the airlines,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the landing passed quickly.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also follows the spirit in the $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice, can leave all the bank and that Goliath coffee will be provided free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It will still be free to hand out water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Us Airways short time was trying to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned that after seven months, after the passenger began to complain, and no other major airline not followed its example.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The initiative frontier on charging for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is it the latest measure to attract customers to its Web site.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay online sellers of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It gave to all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, not to turn in on-line travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">All but frontier went further in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, she began to give two times less frequent flyer miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday she cut the bonus number of miles up to 25 percent of the miles of travel.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So, the trip to 1,000 miles from the frontier, were purchased from online travel agencies, would get 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The frontier has a base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but its business is declining and unprofitable.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Revenues decreased by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic is trying to improve finances frontier in the framework of the sale of the airline.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European country that has recognized the third floor of children born with external sex organs intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Newborn will no longer be necessarily attributed to male or female gender.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify gender as uncertain or unknown in their birth certificates.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about the newborn's gender, and to counter discrimination visibly intersex people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One visibly intersex people, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I am not a man and a woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain created by doctors patchwork product with bruises and scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">About one in two thousand children, charities each year is neither a boy nor a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They have the intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological states that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development &quot; - the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, Honda (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed external sex organs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallace Simpson, perhaps, was a intersexual.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the US say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information to assign it than to wait and monitor psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all, it will happen.</seg>
		<seg id="11">New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Visibly intersex children create an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but most children don't have them,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can assign to the floor without surgery and then to see how developed a personality.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science about how the child will develop any gender identity, not too accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one can answer questions about why this is happening.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It's like a mystery about why people are gay.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes visibly intersex people as different from transgender or transgender because the state has less to do with gender, and to their biological structure which is neither exclusively male nor female sex, and typical of both at once or not is for one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives a general idea of the discrimination that confronts visibly intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes of prejudice.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Boys with gender variations now have a special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal has already allowed adults to be male, female or &quot;third gender&quot; in its official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia this year, Welby became the first man in the world, recognized asexual, upheld in court the right to maintain an indefinite sexual status for life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in German passports will be the third rohace in addition to the M and F-X, is visibly intersex.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues are still arouse controversy, according to a news release on the channel France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this strongly Catholic country, signed a petition on the &quot;gender theory&quot; from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">American Web site Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that &quot;in a situation when the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity-no, we Pereverzeva two more pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Web site baby zone that she would have preferred that the children have sex at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Raising a child is difficult and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,&quot; she said the Web site for parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The children need stability and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born with both male and female sex organs, called androgyne-named handsome Greek god who had signs of both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And yet just ten years ago the medical community perceive gender as a leaf on which all you can wipe, and then again to draw.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now many disputed ethical reason for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes makes the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to the floor when they grow up.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the mid-20th century, it was called &quot; urgent psychiatric case, &quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When these children were born, you called Not the psychiatrist-you called the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The dominant theory about how to treat children with genitalia intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Mani from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender easily amenable to change.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He introduced the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that the signals of the environment, including the social-how parents raise a child, interact with genes and hormones child, determining whether a person is considered to be a man or a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one case of 1966, known as the &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theories were called into question.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He told the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during a sloppy circumcision, fully to castrate child, removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Mani has presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but this was not the case,&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15 years old, he was a boy and married to a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But in the 38 years he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The Drescher said that today, some doctors are still &quot;apply this model.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who experienced these operations to change sex, declared himself, &quot;dissatisfied with the result.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such was the case and Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but with the genitals of intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors were unable to pinpoint whether there has been a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he will never be able to live &quot;full life&quot; men.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So soon after his birth in 1976 external sexual organ and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He began to give women hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I'm not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In the 18 years he was appointed the vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But while in depression and understanding that something is wrong, he demanded a medical documentation.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he learned, it was terrible.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development, which didn't give his body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After learning the truth, he again became the man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing their breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The operation made him infertile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today he is in defense of others in the organization called Interface Project, trying to bring in the normal perception of people with intersexuality.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California Association of Legal Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law &quot;encourages to labels and the stigma.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and to give the child &quot; undetermined sex, &quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We believe that it is better to a male or female gender, then to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we have not yet seen, how will this law, so all we can do is build assumptions.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third floor.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexual identity,&quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law implies its assigned at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">It is a battle, in which young children should not enter at this stage.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr son the Baratz, mammolist radiologist from Pittsburgh, which has a daughter with sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law &quot;will support&quot; as parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">The daughter of Baratz, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a disorder of sexual development under the name &quot;syndrome of full P.O. to androgens.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because its androgenic receptors incorrect work, Kathy developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has her vagina, but not of the uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now, at 29, Katie is married and a residency in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Despite the fact that she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent via adoption or gestational surrogacy motherhood.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents the time to not take any hasty decisions themselves,&quot; said Bartz.</seg>
		<seg id="76">He gives them time to do some tests and to understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they would be male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this case you in order-and raise the child, love child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a lovely child, and you feel the joy.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We don't need to quickly do the operation, which is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the emotion, which is driven by parents, because they don't feel that doing the right thing,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">In the end the child will decide how Paul him or her more comfortable, and it is wonderful.</seg>
		<seg id="82">This gives the children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.</seg>

		<seg id="1">But no one was ready for the emergence of three-year-old Fenton of Kirkland.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before it made its first steps, this baby with his pet Shetland ponies trot toffee rushed through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adults rivals far behind.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The inseparable pair-the same growth-has received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Centre for equestrian sport Sunnybank in radar near Cardiff.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Leaving on a general review on the background of men and women in elegant hats-caldrons, he shifted the louder their cap and proudly spent around two years of toffee.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Judges praised the Fenton for his not on the years developed an innate ability of dealing with horses.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The toffee has received the highest score for appearance and character.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Fenton gave toffee on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been involved with Shetland pony every day.</seg>
		<seg id="8">His 30-year-old mother Donna said: &quot;The Fenton and toffee are a beautiful duet.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">They had a lot of rivals, but the two have gone with the Gold Cup and Rosicky.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It was only his second performance with toffee, and we were all delighted when he won.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Totally unknown people on the scene thought him so phenomenal that wanted to be photographed with him.</seg>

		<seg id="14">He fled on the sand along the entire length of the stage and, although looked so tiny, it did its job.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Fenton crazy of animals-he loves horses, tractors and farm, and he has two chickens, about which he cares.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Judging from how he started, soon he will have to take part in &quot; Horse of the year &quot; - and I'm sure he will perform well.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A spokesman for the annual horse fair said: &quot;Fenton only three years, but he knows how to deal with their ponies.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">Together they are a great team.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Judges noted the Fenton and toffee for their appearance and how they have presented themselves on the show-ring.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Court has suspended the execution of decisions on the practice of &quot;stop-and-search &quot; in the New York Police Department</seg>
		<seg id="1">On Thursday the Court of Appeal Federal District has suspended enforcement of a court ruling requiring changes to stop-and-search &quot; of the New York Police Department, and has suspended the judge from the case.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the US said that the execution of decisions judges Shira Sheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution in how he carried out a programme of detention and interrogation.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city has appealed her decision and issued a corrective measures, including an order to appoint the controller to help police station to change practices and related training program.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On Thursday the Court of Appeal heard the debate of the parties on the request to suspend.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The appeals court stated the need to remove judges because she had breached the code of conduct of U.S. judges and 1863 with the need to avoid demonstrations of bias, in part because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing public response to criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people unnecessarily referring to blacks and Latinos under the program &quot;Stop-and-search.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">She was appointed as the external supervisor to oversee large-scale changes that include the reforms in the field of policies, training and monitoring, and decided to run a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in police stations, where most of the arrests.</seg>

		<seg id="10">Debate on the appeal of the city should be held after March 14, 2014.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The tactic of &quot;stop and search &quot; was criticised by many lawyers on civil rights.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;Stop-and-search&quot; practiced for decades, in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased sharply under the administration of an independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching in 2011 of absolute record 684 330 people, most of them blacks and Latinos.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed in court a collective action.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Supporters of the changes in the program &quot;Stop-and-search&quot; in the New York Police Department said that these changes will end the unfair practice, will generate more reliable and efficient police service and could affect how other departments police implement the practice.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Opponents argue that the changes will lower the morale of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police because of the reduction in the number of officers on several thousand over the last decade.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The judge noted that it does not stop the practice of &quot;stop-and-search,&quot; which complies with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stops of people.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The prime minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will be considerably lower after the country will sign an association agreement with the European Union.</seg>
		<seg id="2">He stated this in the course of conversation with readers of their pages on Facebook.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">I can definitely tell you that prices are determined by many factors, including, among others, and customs duties.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Now, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on free trade area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be considerably lower.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The federal government insists that the rescue package of $325 million for weakened health systems Tasmania will be complemented by severe conditions that guarantee that the state government would not spend money wasted.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent measures&quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The decision on funding for four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government has proposed a package of emergency relief measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems, standing in front of the state,&quot; said Ms. Plibersek.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The package of $325 million includes $31 million on a campaign blitz on routine operations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and undergoing surgery to remove cataracts, will help to overcome a backlog.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There is also money for clinics, patients without prior records in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care at the hospital, training medical professionals, mental health services and implementation of systems of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments will be made by leading doctors to implement ideas about how best to help the health system Tasmania,&quot; said Ms. Plibersek.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania, will work in the strict accountability and responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The state will need to maintain the current levels of funding in order to get the money to the Commonwealth, and monthly report about where he spends such additional funds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Will be created a commission of three people to make sure the state provides the services as efficient and effective.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million nothing will decide &quot;if will not follow the real reform that would put the health system Tasmania on a more sustainable basis.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless, he praised the government for a response to its request for urgent aid, with which he first turned to the prime minister in early May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I hope that the package of federal assistance will significantly contribute to the conclusion of the health care system of this state from critical states,&quot; said Mr. Wilke.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for the recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement represents a &quot; solution, similar to face.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason we are here is that the Labour government of the state pulled out $430 million from the health system, &quot; he told the ABC TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When the government lifts the state of almost half a billion dollars, and the commonwealth is investing $300 million, you can't pretend that this is good news.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no one dollar from the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The cry of despair of Obama voter</seg>
		<seg id="1">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says that Obama has allowed the obstructionism of Republicans to nullify laudable efforts.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The obstructionism can't serve as an excuse for problems with the Web site reformulate Obama health systems, Attack of the drones</seg>
		<seg id="4">Memoirs about the Obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at the medical faculty of Harvard University.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I thought that this book will inspire me in a time of gloom on the second course of medical faculty and will revive in me a sense of hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It's called &quot; The Audacity to Win, &quot; and it is a memoir about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I finished the evening to write the reports according to my patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when the policy inspired millions of people, and the performances could capture the spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Victory in the elections was impressive, and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historical moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates wept with joy, and my parents I did all newspapers, which only they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The White House was supposed to come to a young team of strategists, and the nation was ready to change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At the time of Obama into office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The return at present is a rude awakening, as Wudeluene from dreams.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember those days of optimism-they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years that have passed since I cast my first ballot, the changes really happened.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was something that I even could not imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I give Obama credit for its large and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on available medical care until the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell, &quot; killing Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked many attempts to move our country forward: Immigration reform, the choice of a public health care and closing bases in Guantanamo, among others.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after countless number of times, when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I have ended the explanation that I can provide.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I have reached the point of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The obstructionism of the Republicans can't explain permission to wiretap foreign leaders or strikes by drones on innocent children in other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He can't explain the data collection about the private lives of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of whistleblower, revealing improper actions of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He could not explain the killing of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which says that attach the White House efforts to silence the media, are &quot;the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And the last time he can't justify that fails to create a simple Web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on available medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I don't know, if I was to be expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Should I was at the age of 18 years to understand that the leadership may contradict to political campaigns, preconstruction?</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is obvious, that the work on elective office is not predictable programme of action, because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and such random events, like the massacre in Newtown.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Yet all my examples listed above, you can see that they were largely by his own choice of the administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And this is what bothers me the most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm for his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney was a strange and an alternative, it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on their own policies or views.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I thought that in his second term Obama, freed from the constraints of future elections, will justify the hopes, about which we have heard for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, when this week, Obama's approval rating has dipped below 45%, to return to 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me homesick for many promises that was gone.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton has dealt Obama a resounding defeat in a primary election in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At the meeting, according to the analysis of the causes of failure, he told his employees that they should go back to normal and remain true to their purpose.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want to ensure that we back our appeal,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;We have to remember who we are.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="42">Has been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Comments expressed in this opinion belongs exclusively to the Nathaniel to Morris.</seg>

		<seg id="0">In Egypt takes the oath the first freely elected president</seg>
		<seg id="1">Mohammed Morsi takes the oath, but the day of its celebrations is unlikely to Znamenov an end of political struggle in Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt,&quot; when he was sworn in, becoming the first freely elected president, Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes in the court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life-absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization, which served as a target for tough actions of successive governments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers, when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters gathered near the courthouse, to welcome a new president, and, unlike the presidential pumps in the time of Mubarak, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Although Morsi was derided as uncharismatic &quot; spare wheel &quot;brothers,&quot; his personal prestige has surged since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only Islamists, but also to all those who want to end the uprising of 2011 against Mubarak's authoritarian.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; said Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges are encased in the panelled hall, where he has taken the oath of office.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to give his inaugural speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He was given an official reception with military orchestra, who performed the national anthem, during which he stood to attention.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Attended a military figure is Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.</seg>
		<seg id="14">His arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot;the army and the people are one hand,&quot; chanted the hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, a Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising began, completed the authoritarian Mubarak's rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, which his office was deprived the military council who took the case from the deposed leader.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But by agreeing to take the oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Speech Morsi in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

		<seg id="9">Research shows that English schools devote less time mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours per week in the quarter) than in most countries.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For comparison-Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, pupils are engaged about 138 hours.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Although formal demands to spend more time in the schedule mathematics will not be, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics in combination with an increased coefficient table ratings, are likely to serve as an incentive for providing schools with extra training on this subject.</seg>

		<seg id="4">James Clapper, director of national intelligence in the US in September, again assured that the United States does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who resolutely-began to publish its treasure trove of intelligence secrets to the United States, European governments and leaders of companies no longer sure whether to trust the director on the word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports that the National Security Agency in the United States watched the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored, providers of cloud services, including Google and Yahoo, has raised paranoia corporations, caused by the surveillance state, to new heights.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The UK government, which is leading the talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to consider further improve throughput railways and reducing the length of trips to northern England and Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This should include the ability to overcome the path from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London three hours or less.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our aim for HS2 is to create a truly national network, which will make the UK and its cities are closer to each other.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">The agency Rosbalt was stripped of the status of media for abuse</seg>
		<seg id="1">On October 31, the Moscow City Court ruled to annul the license registration agency Rosbalt, &quot;writes&quot; the tape.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The prison agency status of media insisted Roskomnadzor, systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the course of the process was created a nasty precedent: The court decided to close the media, effectively denying the right to nominate counter-arguments.</seg>
		<seg id="4">What is the &quot;Rosbalt&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">CJSC &quot;news agency Rosbalt&quot; was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In subsequent years, the agency has opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Also, the agency operates offices in countries of the former USSR.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since 2001 the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; was developed and operated as a federal information-analytical news agency.</seg>
		<seg id="9">By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="10">While the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; always took very specific niche: The nucleus of exclusive publications of the agency were (and are still) notes with a reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Talk about the proximity of the security forces continued throughout the existence of the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Along with the fact that the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions was saying and what the head of the project was Natalia Chaplin-the wife of Viktor Cherkesov's.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The role of Chaplin in leadership &quot;Rosbalt&quot; up to the end not clear: More often than not it is known as the &quot;head of the project.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">The director general of the agency is Larisa Afonin, editor-in-chief-Nikolay Ulyanov.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The last time the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; did not appear in the ratings federal media-neither the quote, nor the audience.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In October the agency ranked 25th in the rankings of attendance of Russian media on version of clicks.</seg>
		<seg id="17">According to the same clicks, the average daily audience of site Rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views) a month-about three million unique visitors.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Among the most popular materials over the past five months-notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of lead singer of group King and jester,&quot; pogroms in metropolitan Biryulevo.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The conflict &quot;Rosbalt&quot; Roscomnadzor started in July 2013 when entered into force of the amendment to the media law, which banned journalists abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The agency discovered the forbidden vocabulary in two published on the website of the videos (&quot; got from Krasnodar &quot;and&quot; Pussy Riot has desecrated oil rigs &quot;).</seg>
		<seg id="21">Further the parties describe differently.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Roskomnadzor based on found material has accused the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; gross and systematic violation of media law and went to court with a demand to deprive the agency's license.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In &quot;Rosbalt&quot; stated that claims of unlawful: First, the videos were not editorial content, secondly, Materne words in them were masked, and thirdly, immediately after the videos were removed from the site.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The agency appealed against claims of Roscomnadzor in World Court-and when 22 October 2013, the Moscow city court has accepted a lawsuit (Roskomnadzor), the examination of these complaints still continued.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, the magistrate decided not in favor of &quot;Rosbalt &quot;: Editor-in-chief Nicholas Ulyanov was convicted in violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles-10 thousand for each video.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Obviously, it was foreordained and the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court-to abandon the idea that the outcome could be decided even earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="27">On 31 October, the court took the decision to annul a certificate of registration of the &quot;Rosbalt,&quot; effectively depriving the agency of mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="28">That is not to say that the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; during this confrontation remained in solitude.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (the statement in the name of the head of Roscomnadzor Alexander Gerova October 10 signed 26 deputies; the document was filed on the initiative of the CPRF).</seg>
		<seg id="30">Consider closing the magazine claimed the head of the Russian Union of Journalists, Vsevolod Bogdanov, president of the Moscow journalists' union Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential human rights council, Mikhail Fedotov.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roscomnadzor even gave him some guarantee that to withdraw the license deal would not go.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The trial &quot;Rosbalt&quot; showed: Under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a mass of information in Russia today is the big question.</seg>

		<seg id="25">According to Smith, the process of destruction of the infrastructure for the production from 1999 was &quot;particularly difficult&quot; because we had to work in conditions of the continuing conflict.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: Gap with Europe gives Scots the choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another scary story about independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time we warn that an independent Scotland would have to join the European zone of free movement as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Then comes the stories about the passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrionova shaft.</seg>
		<seg id="4">True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits of free movement across the rest of Europe, though-what's predictable-it has not appeared in the headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as it suits them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Because Scotland now is not included in the Schengen area, the continuation of the compliance requirements will become cheap concession of Brussels in return for what he really wanted from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So it's not deserving of attention the story.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And so old that she turned into a fossil: I first heard gossip about what &quot;independence means passport control,&quot; at least 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the retelling of the old fairytale.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why an independent Scotland should fulfill the orders of Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">The real European news: The great post-war plan to unify Europe finally has stalled.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With eurocrisis project &quot;Europe&quot; is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Across the European Union of parties opposed to the EU or the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the party of the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, founded this year alone-appeared out of nowhere and got almost five million votes at the September federal election, thus essentially replacing &quot;the Free Democrats&quot; (the equivalent of our &quot; Liberal Democrats &quot;) from the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There was always the internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the current economic crisis became a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, has led many people to the idea that the project &quot;Europe&quot; has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments work with excessive budget deficits, this was true only for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members on exchange rates, favourable for German exporters, &quot; that German politicians and want to preserve.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency southern Europe is already at a disadvantage in terms of production capacity in comparison with Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only thing saving tool-to cut wages and government spending that actively supported by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">For the current budget problems and currency lies a deeper problem of productive capacity of Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of green energy measures, implemented by Brussels, is a cipher, meaning the subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times more for gas than in the US.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This paralysis adverse price terms, as we have seen in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">No freezing of salaries in the world will not stop an overwhelming victory cheap shale gas from the United States over European petrochemical industry.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result, the brewing revolt, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and to put Paris on one level with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a tool to gain political legitimacy, and have already imposed their own economic policies in Europe, leaving destroyed the French economy in a mess.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result-right, anti-EU party Marine Le Pen of the National Front just won a decisive election, the new yardstick for the ruling Party of Socialists into third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;The Front&quot; is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote-a timely warning to British Labour that cannot proceed from the assumption that the split among the right-wing will automatically impact in favor of the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among French white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the elections to the EU next year, to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If-and it is very likely that anti-EU party will receive support in this election, this block will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here's my opinion: Soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it will once again be something vague &quot; Europe (sovereign) of nations,&quot; which enjoyed General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and a few of her dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I assume that the UK distances himself from the project, hoping to move closer to the US.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific indicates the likelihood that the UK will be left without attention in the cold Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In what position it leaves Scotland?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to become a region (essentially) Little England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can protect their own economic interests, what it means, among other things, to send the Berlin and Brussels to hell in a handbasket.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in the broader European agreements on condition that we will keep its currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other countries-like-minded people will be easier in nonfederal Europe of Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is-ironically-the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity, which received a majority of votes in 2011 due to the objections of spending cuts proposed by (Labour) and implemented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and later by the coalition with the Tories and Liberal Democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Scotland would be ludicrous now to vote for independence, only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="1">African American and Hispanic girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white, research shows.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The physical changes do not mean that puberty close</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that blame hormones or other chemicals</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the mechanisms of early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is not so pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge-a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Whether the mother to be startled if her daughter start to form the beginnings of mammary gland and lobby hair grow at 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the children's endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time, calming parents-usually it doesn't mean a rapid onset of puberty,&quot; said Koplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, lobby arm and underarm hair and the smell of the body, appear before girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But it was only a small shift in age menarche (the first menstruation) over the last four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12,75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;After the chest begins to develop, is at least two to three years before the menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, who is also author of &quot;early puberty in girls: How to cope with this common problem.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test how puberty will deepen.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The debate about what constitutes actual puberty, but is considered premature, and when a breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp rise in growth of up to 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process will slow down or suspended-that's what the pediatrician can monitor carefully.</seg>
		<seg id="17">More rapid progression can serve as the basis for analyses the endocrinologist to prevent serious problems, such as tumors or cyst.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: Premature aging bones, which ultimately could lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy based on the child's age, level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The Kaplowitz cautious with drugs, but admits that &quot;the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">Another big problem is clear: Parents simply don't want them very young daughters were pregnant.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They worry about the risks of pregnancy, or even about how they will cope with the issues of hygiene,&quot; said Koplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman, daughter of menstruation started in 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.</seg>
		<seg id="26">When she came home from school fearful and upset that it first among their friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that blame hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual promises in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Boys-and girls-puberty begins earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The Kaplowitz argues that the premise, which has the largest weight is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, African American and Hispanic girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white age.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations for.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Around the world on early puberty, apparently, affects everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another mystery: Although boys hair on the face and on the pubis appear at younger ages, a trend towards full early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as the girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other physicians participating in the conference AAP, confirmed the complexity of the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of pimples and pubic hair found even in infants and children of nursery age.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We need to be careful about how we define the true puberty, &quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk with your child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;It may mean an earlier than expected, the conversation,&quot; explained the Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you keep calm, your child is, as a rule, will react well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The girls who bloom early, need proof that even when it happens early, this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="1">John Kerry demonstrated easing tactics of protecting the programs tracking us, making an unprecedented acknowledgment that, in some cases, US spying had gone that far.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The secretary also recognized that guilty, along with Barack Obama, that has been &quot;on autopilot&quot; during the appearance of loud revelations by Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities.</seg>
		<seg id="3">These leaks have put the U.S. government in the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Speaking via video on open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: &quot;There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the Government actually took some of the things on autopilot, because such a possibility existed-and during the second world war, and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, September 11.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Then he became the first senior member of the United States government to recognize that the US spying had gone too far, but stressed that tie the rights have not been violated.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot; In some cases it has gone that far.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain to the people, and now conducts a thorough review to ensure that no one was feeling of abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I assure you, the abuse of innocent people in this process.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted out of good intentions and that its operations tracking has saved many lives.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: &quot; We are in a new world, where people are prepared to blow himself up.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the world there is a radical extremism, reckless and determined to kill people, to blow up people and attacking the government.</seg>
		<seg id="12">And if you were in a position to intercept it, to stop it before it happens?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We actually prevented the collapse of planes, the bombings of buildings and killing people, because we were able to find out about these plans in advance.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, American lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US spying abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint anti-terrorism measures with the United States, &quot; said the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The senator from Connecticut's Chris Murphy said that he talked with members of the European Parliament and other officials this week and concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;For US national security interests really important that Europeans remained by our supporters in relation to our joint anti-terrorist efforts,&quot; said Democrat Murphy, working in his first term and is chairman of the international relations of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;And I'm going to Europe, to let them know that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding metadata that collected the NATO allies and which they shared with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In other revelations were made public by the Snowden documents that the NSA was monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as phones approximately 34 other world leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying activities on its allies as necessary and said that it is usual on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Against the backdrop of this hype Murphy said his office organizes the trip to members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Although Murphy has said that the goal of the trip is to improve relations, he said that a certain degree of the rigidity of the best of intentions &quot; will also be shown.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He said that European leaders must be honest with my people in what spy programs they used for many years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;While we can change our programs tracking to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also must agree with the fact that we're not the only one who engaged in intelligence activities,&quot; said Murphy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should be this weekend to the Middle East and in Poland for the solution of problems of hostility towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as intelligence activities of the United States.</seg>

		<seg id="30">Fortunately for us, the fashion on a child in the pumpkin began only in the past year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up, clipping these pumpkin, not sitting in them.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In Lombard in shopping centre Bendemeer in Singapore the Janani Amirthalingam lays the golden bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for school teaching his daughter.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,&quot; said Ms. Amirthalingam.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although she and earn S $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, demand in various parts of south-east Asia-where the amount of indebtedness of households is growing-is such that ValueMax, where she spends her deal, this week became the third Lombard, listed on the stock exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Credit under pledge of jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalingam), but almost as cheaply unsecured bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Usually the pawnshops in Singapore 3.99 effective annual interest rates at 17% - slightly above 15.4% offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require the credit check or evidence of a salary and can lend faster than banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So millions of people across the region are turning to the pawnshops as households feel the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of sustained growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap loans, palpitates loose monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low-and middle-income people in the pawnshops, to compensate for the reduced incomes as the slowing growth of their economies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week, Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, said the increase in family of leverage, primarily due to growth in mortgage lending, as a risk factor for creditworthiness Asian banks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, compared to 60% in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely emerged from technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, data showed the continuing decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The bottom line is that with the rising price of people in the middle and the bottom [of the scale of revenues] will be looking for ways to supplement their income, where only able, &quot; says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, the Malaysian bank.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Record-high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the haste with which people lay all their belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore, about 70% of the things are 200 Lombard points of the city-state, are gold.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People say: &quot;The price of gold looks good, let's Baladyat gold chain grandmothers and get it back in the next month.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnshops EasyMoney saw a rise in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Growth in the Lombard business is such that ValueMax, operator offices in Bandimere and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where he has four of the shop, but also outside of Asia, too, says Yeah Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will finance the expansion, with 60 percent of S $66 million, attracted this week as a result of placement of shares on the stock exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some lenders have caused fire critics because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeoh says that Lombard does not only offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase the debt directly.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Customers lay items that they already own, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households,&quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The monitoringg is gaining wider public recognition as a means to obtain short-term secured funding.</seg>
		<seg id="25">And while the pawnshops are not only those categories of people who are in dire financial straits.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Rich people in Singapore also use branch of ValueMax, laying gold ingots or Rolex watch, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see customers from all walks of life.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short term for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses, which need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,&quot; said Ms. yeah.</seg>

		<seg id="1">About interfax.ru writes, citing an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;After a media report that the amendments to the U.S. Treasury Olatz Arruti the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate' brotherly Circle', we looked at all of the databases, but such groups not found,&quot; said the interlocutor of agency.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In his opinion, the spread of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="4">As I wrote earlier, yesterday, the US Treasury has published on its website a list of alleged members of a criminal gang &quot;fraternal circle.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Among them was named and the Russian singer Grigory Leps.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It appears in the list as &quot; Grisha, posted the day before.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With the popular Russian singer they coincide.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The exact name is Grigory Leselidze, creative name, place and date of birth.</seg>

		<seg id="10">Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former Soviet Union, whose nationality is not specified.</seg>

		<seg id="18">Officially to him personally, there was no notification, even though I don't know whether they are in such cases.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in your car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">While the American designers roads trying to find money to repair crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, neatly prescreened on the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">These devices, tracking a motorist progeny every mile and transmit that information to officials, are at the center of contentious attempt to upgrade the system of financing America's highways, planning authorities in Washington and the state.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Usually boring arena planning highways suddenly has generated intense debate and alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to provide the right use of small boxes to track the number of miles you progeny and even, perhaps, where you go-and then use this information when drawing up tax bills.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Of the Tea Party movement in shock.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Liberties Union also deeply troubled and raises a number of questions about private life.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And although Congress cannot agree, to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They ponder how over the next decade, you can move to a system in which drivers pay for each mile road, which they pass.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists had already taken on testing these black boxes, some of which have a function of satellite tracking.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is really necessary for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;This is not an issue on which we can have the right to choose,&quot; said Hasan Arat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which trains plans to start tracking the state authorities miles, progeny every California motorist, by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology for this already.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The need for this is aggravated by a lack of funds the government fund the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay at the stations.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Americans already do not buy so much gasoline as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The cars drive more miles on one gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax of 18.4 cents a gallon, had not increased for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians don't want to raise the tax by even one penny at high petrol prices.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;A tax on gasoline is simply impossible to maintain,&quot; said Li Minnich, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In his state, was recently installed on the cars 500 tracking devices for testing system family of payment.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;This would be the best alternative in the long term,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The beggar call it family user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Not surprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, as with tax revenue will be able to change the nature of travel for reducing road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The authorities in California are eyeing up this system during the development of strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state for combating global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the transportation committee of the House, said he also sees this system as the most viable long-term alternatives.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Supporters of the free market in Reason Foundation also delighted from what will force drivers to pay for each mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not just a tax, which will go into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of Political Affairs reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The people directly pay for what they get.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This movement also is supported by two former ministers of transport in the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of family of payment.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The US Senate approved last year, a pilot project costing 90 million dollars, which would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However, leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who in everyday life, often many miles to get to work or to the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">A few states and cities, however, are on the way.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The greatest enthusiasm evident in Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country a 5,000 drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon be paying staff for miles run instead of the tax on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Nevada a pilot project has already been completed.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In New York, he is.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois probate it on a limited basis with participation of trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes transportation departments 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studying how they will be able to conduct these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This concept has not received universal recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the government can monitor every move they make.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about the&quot; Big Brother &quot;and similar things is a big problem,&quot; said Allauddin Khan, head of the strategy and performance management in the Department of Transportation of the state of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It was not what I wanted people.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When the tests were underway, a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its Web site: &quot;Very easy to convert these devices into a full-blown tracking devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be extended for the storage of records about day-to-day movements of individual citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of several states where are the difficult search for low-cost technology that would have allowed the state to record progeny car miles, but no information about the place and time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you will be able to do it, &quot; said Khan, the society will feel more relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The search for this technology has led some agencies of the state to a small, young company in California called true mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Initially the company was not engaged in assistance in tax collection.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She sought to enter the booming market type of insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the device that they test, attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically loaded with modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People will be more inclined to do it, if you don't track their speed and do not track their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, executive director of the true mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot programs.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There is much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, the designers are experimenting with giving drivers of different options.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose the device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they can just to abandon devices, opting instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles, passing all the residents of the state.</seg>
		<seg id="57">In other places we hope to sell the idea of the public, forcing the device to do more, not less.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York City transportation officials are seeking to develop Kalgoorlie device, which will also receive a payment over the parking meters, to provide &quot;pay as travel&quot; insurance pool and to collect data about the speeds in real time from other drivers, motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists will be to involve the benefits that they offer,&quot; according to the document urban design.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some designers transport systems, however, think about not whether all talk about family payment just huge distracting factor.</seg>
		<seg id="61">In urban transport commission in the Bay Area of San Francisco officials say that Congress would be very easy to overcome bankruptcy trust fund for the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="62">An additional lump sum or annual tax it would be possible to charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid their fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no need for radical surgery, when all you have to do is to take an aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on legislation and public relations.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will have to worry about his private life and many other things.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The tax for foreign owners of real estate will lead the London bubble bursts</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Treasury has already completed a preliminary evaluation measures to tax on capital gains, but expects a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the Budget 2012 introduced rate of state duty in the amount of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £ 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership, not as individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="2">At the moment, based on residential real estate in parts of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 fiscal year, already exceeds the total amount on Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber combined.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Mr Cook said: &quot;After the state duty for expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against evasion it is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive real estate is undervalued regardless of influence outdated municipal tax system.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;But the move may cause some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its today's owners will not want it to sell,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The cost of first-class real estate-the top 5-10% of the market for housing costs-in the rich south-west London belt, which stretches from reached up to Wimbledon, increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>
		<seg id="6">According to the research company Savills, prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% in annualised terms, but they are overshadowed by actively developing &quot;domestic market&quot; with the surge in prices in the south-west, in the north (7.4%) and East (6.5%) of the city.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Told the commercial director Denis Grubanov, in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner conducted research for the Study of the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of welded pipes in a month.</seg>
		<seg id="4">After that, the decision was made about the changing profile of the factory and installation of the equipment for their production.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Already this year, shipped more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, said on Thursday the international observer group, while fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where, as I believe, are stored toxic substances.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of annihilation, is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The destruction of the equipment means Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.</seg>

		<seg id="3">The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming books and reported on Thursday night that the next president's assistants had conducted &quot; large-scale research in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011, &quot; to assess whether the exclusion of Biden to help raise a hope for Obama's re-election.</seg>

		<seg id="0">What will the construction of the TPU in Moscow</seg>
		<seg id="1">Each year, city authorities promise to develop more transport and transfer nodes (TPU).</seg>
		<seg id="2">Until 2020, it is planned to enter the 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What actually turns the project, understanding our correspondent.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A couple of months ago, the Metro station Arbat Smolensk-Pokrovskaya line came the construction fence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The caption read, that the arrangement's funding.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It was all very strange, because from Smolensk no terrestrial transport does not stop and, therefore, to change for him.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To get to the nearest trolley bus stops on the Garden Ring, we have to overcome about 130 meters, including ground moving through the Carminucci Lane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now the Smolensk almost all over.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Faded flower stall, dismantled a booth for newspapers, and the asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced by paving.</seg>
		<seg id="10">And the whole transport hub.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Transport-transfer sites are planar and capital, &quot; explains in the press service of the Moscow Department of Transport.</seg>
		<seg id="12">No capital TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And planar suggest the construction of car parks, shopping facilities, hindering the movement of passengers, creating small architectural forms and landscaping.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Actually, Planar TPU not even engaged in the transportation, and professional blogostroika from Department of the major overhaul of the city of Moscow.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Transport is not necessarily a complicated design, &quot; explains director of the Institute of Economics and transport policies of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Sometimes enough of the roof over his head and scoreboard ringing time of arrival of transport.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here, for example, the Metro Moscow has recently opened fully fledged planar transfer site.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Even without awnings, but ride car parks and the scoreboard showing when the next bus.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But in pursuit of a number of officials write the whole thing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Back in 2011, the city was planning to build all the 151 node, of whom 59 capital construction.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Now in plans up to 2020 are up to 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Of them 150 promise to pass more this year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Although the town has the program of development of TPU, not any qualitative criteria, &quot; stated Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization &quot; the city and transport.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="24">Report on the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: First-time transplantation, secondly-convenience.</seg>
		<seg id="26">First of all, the ability to change the type of transport, not going out into the rain.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Moscow when the development of TPU sometimes goes the other way around.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Example &quot;VDNH&quot; Metro.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="29">Earlier commuter buses with Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance MMS.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Now they stop suffered on the opposite side of the street Yaroslava astronauts.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Farther from the subway, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential home.</seg>
		<seg id="32">A gift that residents didn't want bus station and complained in every possible instance.</seg>
		<seg id="33">With capital TPU in Moscow is somehow not immediately asked.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The first of them began to build five years ago, the hotel Planernoe.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The project is called was to be a model.</seg>
		<seg id="36">And really it was an example of how the transfer site, given to investors, turns into a banal shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="37">No, here there are the tourists for buses, the Canopy not to come from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking.</seg>
		<seg id="38">True, the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and 203 in the Moscow TPU places have not fundamentally.</seg>
		<seg id="39">As others pushed away from the Metro.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But under the trade more left.</seg>
		<seg id="41">One of only 32 of the clothing store, and generally there are almost everything-from the stone to the dealership.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Well, in fact, suddenly of the bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road?</seg>
		<seg id="43">We have, when build capital TPU, somehow always turns out shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Recently the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot has decided to give to the market.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Now on the third floor of the TPU Planernoe among marked on the floor of parking spaces is brisk trade.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The vegetables, spices, jeans, non-speech and the guards, viciously Palaguachi on our photographer.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Transfer the site finally turned into a bazaar.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The fact is that before the Metro Planernoe. It was the market, but it demolished.</seg>
		<seg id="49">And in the prefecture traders took pity and allowed to intercept parking funding.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Still, because of high prices there are always empty.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The same ridiculous that the market demolished in order to build in its place... a new painting TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="52">This is the castle.</seg>
		<seg id="53">The Metro Kaluga distance approach from the lobby of the Metro bus was 50 meters, &quot; said Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="54">After the construction of a shopping center, ostensibly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="55">To sit in the bus, you need to go through the whole shopping center.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to work around it under the open sky.</seg>
		<seg id="57">However, construction on Planernoe and Kaluga region will soon appear in the neck.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In mid-September, the City Planning Commission and City Council approved planning decisions for the first eight Capital TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground level.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The monster will grow from the underground &quot;Ring,&quot; it will be 418,7 thousand square metres of space.</seg>
		<seg id="61">Representatives of Railway Stations Directorate RZD, responsible for the construction of the TPU from Metro, already told journalists: In future rise will be located shops, hotels and apartments.</seg>
		<seg id="62">While officials say that a lot of parking places will take from one third to one half of the square.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Take for example, the people's garages.</seg>
		<seg id="64">For example, the garage on 258 cars, which has recently built on the international street, is 8015 square meters.</seg>
		<seg id="65">So, for parking 2.6 thousand cars &quot;- Razumovskaya&quot; will need on the order of 80,000 &quot;squares..&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="66">This is less than a third of the machine that there are going to build.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Let one or two floors will go on all the tourists for buses.</seg>
		<seg id="68">Remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="69">This is, wait a minute, almost two of gum.</seg>
		<seg id="70">If capital TPU at stations and railway stations are building the railway, the rest of the field will be able to master the Metropolitanos.</seg>
		<seg id="71">They also promised that there will be a lot of &quot;functional objects,&quot; including hotels, offices and even gyms.</seg>
		<seg id="72">By the way, in the department of property of the city of Moscow recently told reporters that the draft resolution, under which investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Without any competitions.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Because, they say, that the transport issues for the city-a priority.</seg>
		<seg id="75">Ideal TPU is, for example, the &quot;Harvard&quot; in Boston, or &quot;Spadina&quot; in Toronto, &quot; says Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="76">The trolley buses and trams down under the earth on the subway and the distance of the approach from the subway to the tram is only 50 metres without going out on the street.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Around no trade.</seg>
		<seg id="78">But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.</seg>
		<seg id="79">Or nothing we will build, or I'll throat 25 storeys with offices and apartments.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The corporation Bombardier, a Canadian maker of aeroplanes and trains, was announced on Thursday about a reduction in net profit by 15 percent and reduced the number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Located in Montreal company Bombardier also has not published any data for flight testing of its new CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information about whether the ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation to the next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the first flight of prototype aircraft, about one and a half months ago, he was flying only three times, that raises questions about whether stage of tests on schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results had not fallen short of forecasts and led to the shares falling more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron's Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its estimate of &quot;above average &quot; to average because of the belief that the shares of restricted growth in the next quarter or two.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Although the decline in the number of supply aircraft was largely predictable, we, of course, disappointed by the revenue of the transport department,&quot; said Doerksen in stock market review.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders as the continuation of the flight test program.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Nevertheless, if in the coming months will not be announced about new orders, we expect that the market will become more skeptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first prototype aircraft was presented in March and for the first time flown in September after several months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But firm CSeries orders so far, not too much-177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of tests to verify the claims of the company on fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Only now there are 403 of order and agreements with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Chief executive officer, Pierre was confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time when the first plane will be put into commercial operation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and media that the program is progressing according to plan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,&quot; said Boduan during a conference call, adding that the downtime of the aircraft were scheduled ground tests and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">All the manufacturers are planning test in different ways.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We decided to carry out the first flight and to have a break for updates, so we did.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So will occur throughout the flight test program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test samples should make a flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow, as reported by the company.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Still, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first customers will be able to start exploitation of the CSeries aircraft after 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said that it evaluates the term of commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slow pace of flight tests-though, apparently, and consistent with domestic schedule Bombardier-underpins our view that the commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, &quot;.&quot;said Doerksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter, ended September 30, net income Bombardier declined to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Adjusted earnings per share remained the same-9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Gross income decreased slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The world's fourth-largest producer of aircraft reported that he had put 45 aircraft for the quarter, which for the previous year-57.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The portfolio of orders in the aerospace unit was $32.9 billion as of September 30, December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In the aerospace field results were consistent with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become unpleasant factor,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Gross profit at the aerospace division fell 13 per cent to $2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest maker of trains, reported that gross revenue in this sector grew by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, slightly higher rate from December 31.</seg>

		<seg id="1">You can safely argue that New York City is the birthplace of the shooting-comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago pop artist Frank Fay, who was the entertainer in the theater Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Created by Caroline of Hersha, founder of the shooting-club Carolines, the festival celebrates this year its tenth anniversary, counting more than sixty show in small clubs and big theatres.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The majority of these headliners started at Carolines, and then achieved greater success, has reached a level where they are already too famous to perform at the club,&quot; said Hersh.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have created this festival as a way to continue with them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This year's event includes speeches, Vanda Sikes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as &quot; shooting for heroes &quot; - an annual musical-comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where they will appear among others, Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With the extension of the festival has expanded and the world of comedy.</seg>

		<seg id="10">Jenny Slate joined the cast as the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation Area,&quot; though she is best known for a series of viral videos &quot;Marcel-Rabushka in Boots.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">And Diana, and sleet, like other young comedians with distinctive style (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, evil, focused on racial themes the Kamau Bell), is the result of decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One of the most vivid moments of the festival will become an interview David Steinberg with Larry David.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Steinberg started as a shooting-comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in the movies, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="14">From 2005 to 2007 he was leading the show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The meeting will be held in the town hall in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;This city is surely a central element of the whole work, Larry,&quot; said Steinberg.</seg>
