		<seg id="0">The case highlights the NSA total absence of debate on intelligence</seg>
		<seg id="1">How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on one side is offended in public by calling the ambassador of the United States on October 21, and the other overflight prohibited by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence of Edward Snowden board?</seg>
		<seg id="2">In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.</seg>
		<seg id="3">When François Hollande phone or when Barack Obama Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summoned the ambassador of the United States, they react to a real discovery, which is that the magnitude of the American surveillance of all communications France.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and other tracks condemnation of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Is there would be no hypocrisy like a wave of your hand?</seg>
		<seg id="6">The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but research interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When WikiLeaks unveils analysis of American diplomacy, political or other issues in the world, in fact we consider that, in view of American power, this is an important insight.</seg>
		<seg id="8">When we describe the U.S. interception systems against the French diplomacy in the United States is in no way to be outraged by this practice is to describe the world as it is.</seg>
		<seg id="9">France has she received information from the NSA for terrorist operations to our interests?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Can we deprive the U.S. collaboration?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Implementation since wholesale ten years of technological tools powerful interception by the United States, but also France, was officially justified by the fight against terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described both sides as essential.</seg>
		<seg id="13">For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French by the means of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="14">France can be conducted, for example, to transmit entire data blocks on the Sahel region to the U.S., and in return - we have already said quickly - the Americans can provide information on the French of other regions of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="15">So the fundamental question behind this case is not as NSA capacity or the right of countries to develop tools interception, that the issue of the total lack of prior debate, including in parliaments on justification of such systems, the scope must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of violations of civil liberties.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Real risk that the United States? degradation of their image?</seg>
		<seg id="17">However much denounce, I do not see how they can be punished.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The risk to Americans can be double.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The first is when their allies - and that was the case recently - learn their officers, sometimes at the highest peak of their state, were monitored.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries with diplomatic relations with the United States are strained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Another effect may be more economical it: more and more European and South American companies are reluctant, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. providers are subject to U.S. law, and therefore the influence of NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Last element: the vast movement of revelations committed by the world's media, which helps to initiate a debate on monitoring practices of intelligence hitherto non-existent, could push lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the credentials they have given their intelligence services.</seg>

		<seg id="3">964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The UN provides an even higher balance with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This violence is more deadly despite security measures and military operations launched major for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiites.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence raised fears of a new conflagration while neighboring Syria is in the throes of a civil war.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Men are killed in the street or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complained of being marginalized politically and be the target of unjust arrests, favored the outbreak of violence.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the deaths of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), an affiliate of Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists) group, also involved in the civil war in Syria.</seg>

		<seg id="16">Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has numerous meetings with the executive, and members of Congress.</seg>
		<seg id="17">On Thursday, he called for the international community takes a &quot;third world war&quot; against Al Qaeda.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The principle of increased aid to Iraq security is supported by influential senators Republicans and Democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But they have also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by its &quot;sectarian and authoritarian politics.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="20">They also demanded Obama make it clear to Maliki that &quot;the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking</seg>
		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure one takes to smoke a cigarette.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice life of nicotine dependence.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests are needed before starting the tests on humans, but Professor Ronald Crystal at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs were encouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,&quot; said Professor Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains an innocuous virus that was modified to carry the genetic information necessary for designing anti-nicotine antibody.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Antibodies track all nicotine molecules present in the bloodstream and neutralize before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker to have their dose of nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In tests, mice vaccinated who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But the mice who had not been vaccinated were &quot;appeased&quot;, said the researchers, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Previous vaccines against tobacco were ineffective because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Injections should be repeated as frequently as the antibody levels remain high they were too expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, that would prevent nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They know that if they start smoking, they did take no pleasure because of anti-nicotine vaccine, and it will help them lose their bad habit,&quot; he has said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists said the results were interesting but noted that much more research was needed.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not make a call on their mobile phone)</seg>
		<seg id="1">The airline passengers to use their electronic devices from door to door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talking on their cell phone - under the new long-awaited guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect immediate changes.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to another, said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Airlines must prove to the FAA that the planes meet the new guidelines and they have updated training manuals crew and rules concerning the storage devices for compliance.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said it had already received some airlines plans to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted their plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; said the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They are not supposed to turn on before the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain gave the green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices during the descent of the aircraft before landing and do not turn on until the aircraft has landed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the new guidelines, the airlines whose aircraft are adequately shielded from electronic interference may allow passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Once the new policy implemented safely - and we will work closely with carriers for it - it will benefit everyone,&quot; said Glading in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We are frankly tired of feeling as &quot;overseers room&quot; when it comes to this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But it will still be prohibited from connecting to the Internet for surfing, exchange emails, SMS or data download below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers must bring their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble online game playing style that actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled noisily an American Airlines flight after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices like laptops should always be stored because they might hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The regulatory authority for mobile phones belonging to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, Mark Rosenker National Transportation Safety Board, National Transportation Safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered at risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly interfere with navigational instruments, but because we know from the FCC, they could disrupt the antennas of mobile telephony if they are used on board, &quot;said Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., Argue that there is no valid reason for these security restrictions.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Restrictions are also more difficult to apply because the use of devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers forget to turn off their devices, or are deliberately.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA has begun to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation instruments and communication when passengers transported FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New airliners are significantly more electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems had also more resistant to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of airliners should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, said Huerta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Electronic devices today generally emit radio transmissions much lower power than previous generations of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The e-book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Amazon.com is among those pushing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, company officials have charged a commercial airliner of Kindle e-book readers and did fly to see if there were problems, but there were none.</seg>
		<seg id="40">This inspired the members of the Advisory Committee on FAA mixed feelings on the issue of whether the use of devices present a risk or not.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Australian airline passengers will continue to turn their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite the action of the United States to relax the rules on electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers to change their procedures to ensure that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided that they are in &quot;airplane&quot; mode.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Passengers can already do for most of the flight, but many people find it hard not being able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Australian carriers examine the decision requiring U.S. carriers to carry out important work to meet the requirements, but said they did not intend at present to change their procedures.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but noted that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,&quot; she has said.</seg>

		<seg id="11">&quot;Consistent with our current policy, electronic devices can not be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend immediate change that,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The decision of the FAA applies to U.S. airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the decision of the FAA and the reasons thereof.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For U.S. airlines, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Carriers must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing the manuals, training materials, the transportation program of hand luggage and instructions provided to passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;When an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable electronic devices light as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,&quot; said FAA .</seg>

		<seg id="1">When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.</seg>
		<seg id="2">My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed late and disguise ourselves to go in the neighborhood.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Today, I became more stingy.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The last two years, I did not distribute a single sweet and I certainly will not this year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the stats show that I'm the black sheep when talking about Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I look forward to every Halloween party, what are the trends.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Costumes should represent $ 1.2 billion on $ 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This year, inanimate objects sexy rage.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Women no longer need to be sexy professional and they can also be sexy food like pizzas, burgers and carrots.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Regarding men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that spacemen Daft Punk will be among our Instagram photos this year.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I guess there is no harm to remain traditional.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We dressed our dogs last year and to my amazement, they were not alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In fact, Americans will spend $ 330 million on pet costumes this year, according to NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That's a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the case of candy, it does not glandouille.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This is great news for the 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In fact, we buy and we do not tell stories, consuming 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Candy corn is the only thing we do not want to eat, and yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
		<seg id="23">This represents approximately 9 billion grains of corn.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is a mystery that I am not yet come to be elucidated.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nothing is more representative than Halloween haunted houses.</seg>
		<seg id="26">They carry the best names like &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which is actually a real prison), &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $ 500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes these great pictures of you peeing on you that your friends put on Facebook and you can not remove and which type that you like leave a comment of style &quot;pretty face.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">Finally, talking about pumpkins.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Charlie Brown has presented The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carve a pumpkin-shaped lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is something we do since we were little.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fortunately for us, the &quot;trend of baby-pumpkin&quot; began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of these carved pumpkins and we did not have to sit in it.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This year, Americans will spend approximately $ 106 million in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Pumpkins, lanterns slowly wither on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.</seg>
		<seg id="33">If you are looking to get noticed more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to carve their pumpkin 922 kg.</seg>

		<seg id="1">At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Founder President of Mozambique, in the process of toiser, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo peaceful chanting slogans during a rare public demonstration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want peace to return, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, Executive Director of an investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a T-shirt bearing the words &quot;we want security&quot; in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on Independence Square in the capital Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there has been almost daily reports of conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed there over 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by whites then apartheid South Africa as part of government efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts believe that the country should not fall into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stakes are high for the growing economy since the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract $ 50 billion of investment over the next few years from companies as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and the United States Anadarko.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other voltages.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and he launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, October 17.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Assaults on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Dhlakama, leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, spokesman Renamo, according to the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government makes the Renamo responsible for sparking the conflict and accused him of attacking soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza has sought to downplay concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Guebuza said Wednesday AFP, the French news agency that Dhlakama considered himself a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose decisions in government. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Frelimo and Renamo insist they both wish to avoid war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said Renamo abandoned the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the FT he meant that the agreement was not respected by Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,&quot; said Mr. Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that does not stop arguing,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a specialist in Mozambique.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them knows negotiate and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Renamo, which is in favor of electoral reform, had said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt to move a patient to obtain concessions and a war chest of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The share of votes collected by Renamo continues to decline since 1992, and a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo should get a greater number of votes in elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr. Mazanga said Guebuza - who should retire at the end of his second term next year - would destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want fair elections, he does not want peace because he did not want to leave the presidency,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">We do not know exactly what is the capacity of Renamo, but she led flash disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a highway north-south axis major.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira but where is the port where the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal .</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mr. Mazanga was coy when asked if Renamo reiterate that threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; said Mr. Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability has increased frustration aroused by the government, said Fernando Lima, director Mediacoop, an independent media, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that those responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and it is the latter to find solutions to problems,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Nobody cares Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to roads,&quot; he added.</seg>

		<seg id="6">2600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract help catch up.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Funds are also provided for the clinics go to Hobart and Launceston, better patient care, training of medical cadres, dedicated to mental health services and the deployment of electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments correspond to the idea that, according to the front-line clinicians, it is the best way to cure the health system in Tasmania,&quot; said Ms Plibersek.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister said that the Tasmanian Government would face a strict regime of preparing reports and accountability.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The State shall maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A committee composed of three persons will be established to ensure that the state provides services in the most effective and efficient way possible.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr Wilkie said today that $ 325 million does not count for much &quot;unless they are followed by real reform to strengthen the public health system in Tasmania.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">He nevertheless praised the government for responding to the urgent request for help which he presented to the Prime Minister in early May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I hope that the federal bailout will greatly remove the public health system in Tasmania from the blacklist,&quot; said Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the state government, these additional elective procedures largely reverse the recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the spokesman for the opposition health Peter Dutton think today's announcement is a &quot;quick fix.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason we are here is that the Labour government of the State withdrew its $ 430 million health care system,&quot; Has he told ABC TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">You can not have a state government that tears almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth puts $ 300 million, and argue that this is an auspicious day.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr. Dutton visited Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar bailout will be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">He walks in the mud, through the jungle and rivers to provide free medical assistance</seg>
		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Dr Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are not many doctors in this West African country, only 1 to 5,000 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or via your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him, or one of 10 other heroes for the elect &quot;CNN Hero of the Year&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This person will receive $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, George Bwelle watched his sick father alternating periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At first, he only had a broken arm, but he has an infection that has spread to his brain, creating a hematoma which he would be the consequences for the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have taken abroad if we had enough money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Dr. Bwelle has spent years with his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, he gets any treatment he could receive.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not easy,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can leave the house at 5 am, rushing to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">People can die because they wait too long.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation has not changed much since the death of the father of Dr. Bwelle in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay the consultation.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health spending in the country are carried out in the private sector.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; said Dr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And because of poverty, they can not enjoy life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">After seeing his father and all his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 surgeries for free during the last year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Yaounde Central Hospital.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And created a humanitarian association nonprofit, ASCOVIME, who goes to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, with thirty people were crammed in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and through difficult terrain to get to the villages who need the help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Luck does not always follow.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They have repeatedly had to push the vehicle to cross rivers or muddy tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, singing and dancing and offering them the best accommodation available.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle - with his big smile and boundless energy - is more than happy to join in the festivities.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We get 500 people at each visit,&quot; said Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people receiving treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others may receive crutches, collected a pair of glasses or a birth certificate free - documents necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply can not afford to buy it.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening, the team practice simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Operations are typically performed in a school, a town hall or a house, after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to make way for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">With lighting generator, the operating room and sterilization equipment, Dr. Bwelle and volunteers working until the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is a grueling pace, but musicians villages generally help the team stay motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They beat on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work,&quot; said Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the team returned to town, tired but proud of the work she has done.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgeries for free during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference to those they are helping.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man explained that the free operation he underwent to treat a hernia allow it to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;This will change my future and that of my family,&quot; said the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to live this traveling hospital and work as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works the night in private medical practices around Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">This is the second job, he says, which finances 60% association, the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I do not know when he sleeps,&quot; said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with the Dr. Bwelle group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">It is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to conduct these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For medical students and nursing students as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in its mission, it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they don ' not at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We have been involved in operations to help mop up blood or passing instruments to Dr. Bwelle,&quot; said Miss O'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Student volunteers usually pay their trip to Cameroon, and often come with medical supplies collected.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is a hero, there is no doubt,&quot; said Katie O'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not nearly extinguished.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Dr Bwelle, workload relatively constant is not a difficulty.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Help others live happily holding the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I do this work,&quot; said Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I'm doing.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Puzzled scholars have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Professor in lecture halls and classrooms?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Probably, but emphasizing its low for byways, Sciences Po, the Hautes Etudes.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Referee works of others in his office in the rue Gaston Gallimard-?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Indeed, but ignoring the work hidden and underground writing from the publisher.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Heir chair qu'occupa Fontenelle the French Academy?</seg>
		<seg id="7">While again, but knowing that such coronation can not replace real holy oil, the thesis which it happened.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They readily acknowledged him as a great awakener, host and unifying their work, but noting that it was disinclined to produce itself.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In this uncertain picture of the monument &quot;Places of Memory&quot;, to which he attached his name, also contributed.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Evil tongues were able to see a giant flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a sharp glance and weighted scholarship, but hopelessly dilettante.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Both books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that one who passed was not to write a lot and well written.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The book should it justice here permanently.</seg>
		<seg id="13">We find, however, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, jubilation last jump as a joint subject to another foot.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But you soon realize that the disparate objects assembled in this book so beautiful as to bring the dealer a single passion: to discover the constituent node of the French identity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Why the dramatic appeals to national unity?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Identity: it is a time concern.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here are few, we were collectively invited to give a definition.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But the peremptory spirit of our leaders then, the French identity was a timeless essence.</seg>
		<seg id="19">There was deployed in accidents, and the case requires Jacobinism was entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.</seg>
		<seg id="20">One stalking Pierre Nora is quite different.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It does not arise heir of eternal Frenchness, he refuses to define.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Analyst concerned a familiar strangeness, he wanders into a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a shaped object puzzles, tormented irritating questions.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Including this one, which comes from the company itself: why, in a country so permanently installed within its borders, whether formerly solidly built and masonry, we hear these dramatic appeals for unity?</seg>
		<seg id="24">They are so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests that to ward off trouble discord born of French history.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="26">And most iconic is obviously one that splits in two national history.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, the monarchical, the other revolutionary.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The second wanted the death of the first, but could not deny it; rather anxious to find the sacredness and even more eager to unity and indivisibility she beheaded him who was obvious and powerful incarnation.</seg>
		<seg id="29">And from there, a bit invincible nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To feel the uniqueness of the French identity, nothing beats the four not out of the hexagon, so that the American getaway Pierre Nora could be the heart of his book.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Because America and France and the other one makes a revolution, wrote a bill of rights, wanted to start a new company.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But the American cousins ​​only further emphasize what we own.</seg>
		<seg id="33">There, men who had left their old regime in England and no longer had to worry about.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Here, men crowded a native Old Regime, and even more radical.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There a consensus here revolution when she sowed drama and confit.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There founding fathers always honored here and revolutionary ancestors whose only make models, and that the rest are killed each other.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Here institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as to catch as many errors and trials to resume.</seg>
		<seg id="38">La France qui s'en va, la France qui vient</seg>
		<seg id="39">Yet there was a time when the French thought they could mend the torn dress in their history, and overcome the curse of number two.</seg>
		<seg id="40">At the Third Republic, Central and creative moment, Pierre Nora has shown great interest and even tenderness welcoming those who are then used to repair the fracture revolutionary, teaching students everything in the old France preparing obscurely modern France and offering a unified version of their history.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But this peaceful identity had only time.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Here again debate, jostled by the immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of demand-minorities, absorbed in the European space.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The book thus offers both a fascinating portrait of France who goes and circumspect sketch of France comes.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With the added bonus of the portrait of the historian should be some surprises.</seg>
		<seg id="45">We discover that the tramp was a homebody.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The man turned multiple sights, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Prowler margins stood at the center of the center.</seg>
		<seg id="48">And whoever had deposited here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of ​​nation, but was exempted from the initiation of the thesis year, says, cum grano salis, he has finished by doing so.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Though in a less steep shape, more fragmented and more subtle.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But make no mistake, just as binding.</seg>
		<seg id="51">As much as the imposing figure of the university curriculum, this thesis it said inner necessity of life.</seg>

		<seg id="0">How biometrics will invade our lives</seg>
		<seg id="1">No more typing passwords to access their smartphone or pay for purchases?</seg>
		<seg id="2">American researchers, French and Japanese are predicting a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors phones and computers.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Bernard Didier, Deputy CEO of Morpho, even believes that &quot;the century will be biometric.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics, but are worried.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In 2011 alone and in France, the National Commission on Informatics and Liberties authorized 774 fingerprint recognition systems, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in business, government, canteens ...</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Everyone will soon be identified, anywhere and anytime&quot;, is moved Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The reasons for such optimism in some, and pessimism in others?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Biometrics will rely on new techniques that will make new services to citizens and consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Today, in France, the most widely used biometric is fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous system of the palm or fingers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But each technique has its limitations.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;For example, some people who work have concrete fingers badly damaged and their fingerprints are unreadable,&quot; says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field Thales Communications &amp; Security.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And the collection and verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand assume a voluntary gesture and specific people.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is both a safety - can not capture these data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: sometimes the procedure must be repeated and therefore takes time.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Consequently, research is conducted over the past twenty years on other approaches, such as face recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).</seg>
		<seg id="16">With the increase of the accuracy of the sensors and the calculation capacity necessary for the computer data analysis, these techniques become operational.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The accuracy of face recognition has increased tenfold in the past five years, calculated Cyrille Bataller, Director of R &amp; D labs of Accenture in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic crossings using facial recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It is now possible to identify a face or iris movement.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but you need a quiet environment,&quot; said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Unique tamperproof marker DNA also raises hopes and concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,&quot; says Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of education, innovation and foresight to the CNIL.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the analysis of DNA is still very long and costly.</seg>
		<seg id="24">NEC offers the services of a police case costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples from the crime scene and in an hour.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Uses of biometrics can be divided into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who she claims to be).</seg>
		<seg id="26">Identification concerned far the issuance of identity papers: we must confront biometrics (fingerprints, photo, iris) with the information that the state owns all citizens already be on file.</seg>
		<seg id="27">This ensures that a person does not try to impersonate someone else.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This principle can be compared to other applications.</seg>
		<seg id="29">NEC proposes recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or a store.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;We get images of surveillance cameras and compare them to pictures of celebrities circulating freely on the Internet,&quot; says Dany Nassif, loaded, NEC France, business development for biometric identification solutions.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Other use: shoot a chap in the queue in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Authentication initially involved physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens ...) or logical (opening a computer).</seg>
		<seg id="33">There is added, more recently, the presence control.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;A biometric time clock avoids the phenomenon buddy that points to another&quot; justifies Cyrille Bataller, Accenture.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But increasingly, authentication will also involve transactions, especially those made ​​from Internet-connected devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors introducing the card and putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces typing PIN.</seg>
		<seg id="37">A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers in the supermarket: when paying in store with his credit card, the customer does not hit its code but his finger into a reader that scans veins.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The experiment is expected to last six months.</seg>
		<seg id="39">If it is successful, biometric readers could soon arrive in French traders.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Ways to reassure users</seg>
		<seg id="41">There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The first is to explain that it can save time.</seg>
		<seg id="43">&quot;If, through biometrics, a client remains in cash under thirty seconds is significant,&quot; says the director of a large area.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The second is to provide personalized services in a few years, a voice server will recognize your voice and offer custom options.</seg>
		<seg id="45">And finally reassure highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;The fingerprints are stored on a first server, the identities of people in a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing, which crashes if you try to move,&quot; Philippe lists Robin, Thales.</seg>
		<seg id="47">However, without further study, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Specialists protection of privacy, they continue to worry.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;Advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: a generalized surveillance&quot; predicts Andrew Patrick, the Commissioner for the Protection of privacy in Canada.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $ 100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on flights.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for hand luggage and $ 2 for a coffee or a soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take with them the unopened cans to off the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new fees apply to baggage bags stowed in the overhead compartment so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said it would pay $ 25 if the fee was paid in advance and $ 100 if travelers are paid once at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The spokesman for Frontier, Kate O'Malley said that $ 100 was provided to encourage travelers to pay in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We do not want to pay that price,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The airlines have started charging the first and second checked baggage in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as much as they could in hand luggage stowed in overhead bins, and there was often no place in these compartments.</seg>
		<seg id="9">These charges are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'Malley said the new fees are not really used to collect money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This is to explain to customers of Frontier loyal it becomes increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy their tickets on the website of the airline will not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus, a passenger queuing at a gate Frontier could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue may have to pay $ 100 for a similar bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'Malley explained that the site and the recording Frontier procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before reaching the door.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The cost of hand luggage Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often grumble about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They estimate that the cost of baggage handling are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many people on Wall Street consider adding baggage fees as a sign showing that airlines do pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Yet many of them have not touched the baggage fees.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first fresh hand luggage there three years, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said consultant Jay Sorensen airlines, which closely follows the extra fee.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He believed in a December 2011 report, the cost of hand luggage Spirit reported $ 50 million per year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover fresh unusual hand luggage imposed by the company.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;I've never seen a boarding process as smooth in my entire career,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he has added, &quot;passengers boarded at the speed of lightning.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also like Spirit and applies a fee of $ 2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier said that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened cans with them, and those who drink coffee may be leftover free.</seg>
		<seg id="29">She always distribute free water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">U.S. Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Decision Frontier to pay a fee of hand luggage when passengers do not purchase tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its website.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay vendors online travel as Orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the tail of a dog are related to his mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Previous studies have found that happy dogs were moving their tails more to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while the nervous dogs were moving more to the left.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;Everyone knows that, in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse emotions positive or negative. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here, we tried to see what was in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that as humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres play a different role in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs react to the movements of tail disordered other dogs, the researchers tracked the animals watching films where other dogs were.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Surely it will not be long before we understand why their tail will sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara explained: &quot;We presented dogs movies where other dogs were - a naturalistic version of a silhouette is to avoid any confounding - and we could tamper with the movement of the tail and the present as going to the left or right. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals have seen a dog wag his tail expressionless to the right (from the perspective of the dog wagging the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they spotted a tail deviate mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging the tail), heart rate accelerated and they seemed anxious.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, he believes that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He added: &quot;If you repeatedly encounter other dogs and if you notice, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right attitude leads to less friendly, you will react based on this experience. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Researchers say the findings could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Science at Bristol University professor, said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln discovered that the dogs turned their head to the left when they watched an aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, said: &quot;The dogs were more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is in the Italian study. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">He indicated that the differences could be that the dogs who participated in the various studies are not fully considered animals movies or robot dogs like dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he has said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;Although many elements identified in various mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified - and dogs are no exception,&quot; said he said .</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, given the ease with which their behavior can be saved, it will surely not be long before we understand why sometimes move their tail on one side and sometimes on the other.</seg>

		<seg id="2">M23 appears about to be beaten after being chased localities north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which he controlled from the beginning, there was 20 months of the uprising.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;We will continue the M23 and drive him wherever he is hiding because they are criminals,&quot; he told Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for FARDC.</seg>
		<seg id="4">We must not let them rearrange because they torment the Congolese people for too long.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The time has come to bring peace.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Kerry said: &quot;It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have read some things on autopilot because that we had the opportunity, during the Second World war and to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course 11. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">He became the first senior member of the government of the United States to admit that American espionage had gone too far, but insisted that the rights of each were not violated.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;In some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately. &quot;</seg>

		<seg id="11">There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow and attack governments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?</seg>

		<seg id="15">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and he was concerned about the threats that had been made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations in because of the feeling of frustration with the monitoring of the National Security Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism,&quot; said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and President of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the U.S. Senate, in an interview from Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">And I am going to Europe for good to them that we must continue to work together to fight against terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The press reported that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has strained relations with certain allies of the United States, however, the agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Other revelations reported by Snowden documents disclosed by which the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The Director of Intelligence James Clapper, has justified the espionage allies stating that it was necessary and it was a common practice on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said his office organized a trip of Congress, to be held this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The names of other participants legislators should be unveiled in the coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He said that the route remains to be defined.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to help improve relationships, but also to show &quot;tough love.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">He explained that European leaders should be honest with their citizens about the type of spy programs they apply themselves for years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;We can change our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world of spying,&quot; said Murphy.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of productive recovery, already announced, Monday, Oct. 21.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Having renounced the proposed purchase of the plant in January, will return today.</seg>
		<seg id="4">You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, speaking of &quot;so-called workers&quot; who &quot;work three hours&quot; a day, &quot;crazy&quot; unions, to the CGT.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We do not understand this about-face.</seg>

		<seg id="16">What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tires, has good facilities, is well located and has space to expand.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Why Titan as he needs this plant?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Titan does not need to buy the plant.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But with proper and competent workers prices, it's worth a try.</seg>
		<seg id="20">What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?</seg>
		<seg id="21">If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think that 100% of employees would have accepted.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Now imagine that Titan buys Goodyear plant closed.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Therefore, Titan could move machines to Poland or any other country of the European Union still has its own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Now he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Titan agrees to recruit among the approximately 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As Mr. Montebourg he need a commitment of Titan before trying to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Therefore, there will be more people in the factory.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr. Montebourg said that you were willing to guarantee these 333 jobs over four years.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Do you confirm?</seg>
		<seg id="32">The only number I mentioned to the minister, this is 333.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I know he wants a four-year warranty.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But, as I have said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If all employees accept the proposed purchase of the plant starts with zero employee.</seg>
		<seg id="36">How can we provide guarantees of job duration when there is no more employees on the site?</seg>
		<seg id="37">If Mr. Montebourg achieved that the CGT and agree Goodyear and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens North over four years.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A federal appeals court Thursday blocked a judge decision requiring changes in the control program and search the police department in New York and was removed from the case.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Court of Appeal of the United States (second circuit) has indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was stayed pending the outcome of the appeal by the city call.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to monitor and interrogate citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city has appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department to change its policy and training program associated with it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Court of Appeal heard arguments Tuesday on the request for suspension.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Court of Appeal held that the judge should be removed from the case because it has breached the Code of Judicial Conduct compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which it publicly reacted to criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their program of stop and search.</seg>
		<seg id="8">She pointed to an external controller to oversee the changes, including reform policy, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in areas where happening the highest number of controls.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In August, the city of New York has agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are rejected after a police check.</seg>

		<seg id="11">Tactical control and the search was criticized by many civil rights.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This control system and search there for decades in some form, but the number of registered controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest level in 2011 with 684,330 controls which were mainly black and Hispanic men.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Legal action was filed in 2004 by four men, all from minorities and turned into collective action.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On a beautiful day in late August, a helicopter of the German police flew low over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="2">By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the national agency of German intelligence, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">German media explain that BfV hoped identify the presence of listening antennas and the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, insisted again in September on the fact that the United States do not use their capabilities for foreign intelligence &quot;stealing trade secrets from foreign companies on behalf of companies U.S. to increase their international competitiveness and increase their profits. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became informant, began to reveal its inexhaustible wealth of information about the secret surveillance of U.S., European governments and business leaders do not know whether to believe Director word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports, according to which the National Security Agency U.S. spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. service providers of cloud storage, including Google and Yahoo, more than ever sparked paranoia companies in respect of state surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The revelation that the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, perhaps for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel's back.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, while business leaders are surely also potential targets.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden made ​​transparent intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I think it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; says Oliver Grün, President BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.</seg>
		<seg id="12">German companies believe that the United States is as important as China when it comes to industrial and data theft espionage, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY risk.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However all documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, no evidence to date that the United States has sent trade secrets of foreign companies to U.S. companies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Politicians have expressed their concern at the idea that the EU does not have sufficient computer skills and Internet and think it should strive to reduce its dependence vis-à-vis the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Business leaders are skeptical about it.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A member of the German parliament said that we should create a German Google.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;This is not the right way to do,&quot; said Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company enterprise, SAP.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If a strong IT industry in Europe we wanted, then he should not let it die there 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Everything is subsidized in Germany, coal cars, passing by farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Everything but the IT industry.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by the revelations of Snowden was a shock to some companies that previously thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A big change is happening in cloud computing as European leaders have realized that the data stored in the United States are governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-US users have given up their plans to use an American provider of cloud storage after the revelations about the U.S. exploration program Prism data.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: &quot;Our customers now ask us a question they did not ask us there one year: where my data being stored and can you assure me that physically remain in this jurisdiction? &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are a confirmation of what they already knew, that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and such data should therefore be kept at all costs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It is not surprising that economic espionage.</seg>
		<seg id="28">There always has been.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;This is a recurring theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the present discussion,&quot; said Kurt Bock, CEO of the company producing chemicals BASF.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Americans spy on us on the trade and industry as we spy on, as it is in the national interest to protect our businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal preventive measures they have in place in case the advantage would leave an opponent.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Large corporations have long hammer the message that it is unwise to say the least to get a free USB key at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board of Directors automaker Audi says that the collection of cell phones before board meetings, so they can not be used as listening devices remotely, is a common practice for years.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The BfV Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid cell phones when traveling abroad because of the risk to the integrity of smartphones.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Prepaid cell phones are then discarded.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, there is concern that small and medium enterprises are vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;SMEs often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their trade secrets against unauthorized access,&quot; warns the BfV in a report.</seg>
		<seg id="39">U.S. warn their own societies on economic espionage activities conducted by other countries.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Mr Cook said: &quot;Following the increase in stamp duty on properties of high value and the introduction of anti-avoidance legislation in this area, it is very difficult to argue that the high value properties are sub-imposed independently of the effects of the system of obsolete housing tax. &quot;</seg>

		<seg id="2">Transportation Minister Baroness Kramer said the project &quot;would bring the United Kingdom.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was &quot;excited&quot; at the prospect of working with the British government on the project.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In June, the government has revised upwards the estimated cost of construction of the high speed link between London and the north of England, from £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the improvement of rail capacity and improve journey times for the north of England and Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This should include the opportunity to journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh more than three hours.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 provides a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">We push the HS2 project because its advantages are enormous.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Without it, we face a problem of capacity of our rail network.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But it is also to develop connectivity between 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better with HS2.</seg>
		<seg id="13">British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: &quot;Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support &quot;unequivocal&quot; the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an &quot;undetermined&quot; &quot;unspecified&quot; on his birth certificate or sex.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The purpose of the Act was to remove the pressure off the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sex reassignment surgery for their infant, and to fight against discrimination against intersex people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the BBC, an intersexed person would say years later, &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">What I will stay the patchwork created doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is estimated that one in 2,000 babies each year, is neither a boy nor a girl.</seg>

		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson could be intersexed.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the U.S. say that when sex can not be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign, and then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering surgery, if necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist at New York and a specialist in gender identity issues, said that the new German law &quot;seems like a good idea.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people suffer from very serious illnesses that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is possible to make a sex assignment without operation, and how identity develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nobody can answer the question of why this happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It's like the mystery surrounding homosexuals.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the various intersex people as transgender or transsexual people, as their status is not related to sex but their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is usually both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and genitals) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced intersex and transgender people in employment, and the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Boys of non-conforming gender now have camps that are specially designed for them.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; on their official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, an Australian 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as a &quot;neutral&quot; after winning his appeal that allows him to keep an 'unspecified' sex life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">German passports will include a third designation next to M or F - X intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report aired on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of lawmakers this fundamentally Catholic countries have signed a petition that &quot;gender theory&quot; be removed from the textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">U.S. Catholic Online website also opposed to German law, writing that &quot;since the world is dragged into a new kingdom where gender is a choice, but where sexual activity is not one, it reverses two pillars of civilization. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said she would prefer to Baby Zone that sex is attributed to babies at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Being a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your baby,&quot; she said on the website for young parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born without male or female sex organs are called hermaphrodites, named after the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And there is barely a decade, the medical community considers gender as a slate that can be erased and which can redraw.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now there are many who question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors may err, not knowing how a child will feel when his sexual reassignment grow.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When these children were born, we did not call the psychiatrist, we telephoned the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The prevailing theory on how to treat children provided with ambiguous genitalia was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins, who considered that gender is malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He dedicated the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that the social and environmental signals - how parents raise a child - interact with genes and hormones of a child for the shape so that it is identified as male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in a case of 1966, known as the &quot;John / Joan&quot; his theories led to controversy.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised parents to a little boy whose penis had been cut during a botched circumcision do fully castrate him also removing the testicles, and raise him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Money has presented this as a case of successful transition, but this was not the case,&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">At the age of about 15 years, it is again a boy and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But at age 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher said that some doctors &quot;always repeat this model.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived the sex change operations say &quot;[that] they are not satisfied with the result.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36 year old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The doctors could not really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never have a &quot;good life&quot; as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testes and was raised as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He was made to take female hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew I was not a girl&quot; Has he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was not happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked his medical records.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he discovered horrified.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at birth - and nobody had ever told me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a disorder of sex development (DSD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After learning the truth, he is a man again, following treatment with testosterone and has been removed breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Surgery made ​​him sterile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, he advocates for others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to standardize the collection of intersex people.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the nonprofit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law &quot;invites labeling and stigmatization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an&quot; indeterminate &quot;sex,&quot; she has said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We fear it encourages interventions.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think it would be better to assign a male or female, and wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis said his organization supported the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the name third sex.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind,&quot; she added.</seg>
		<seg id="66">German law for the allocation of sex at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group radiologist said that German law &quot;will empower&quot; parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a syndrome called DDS complete androgen insensitivity.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">It has a vagina, but not ovary or uterus.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Today aged 29, Katie is married and internal child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption or surrogacy services.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law leaves room for parents to not have to make hasty decisions,&quot; said Baratz.</seg>
		<seg id="76">This gives them time to do some tests and understand, and a delay before recording &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="77">So far so good - you can raise your child and love.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.</seg>
		<seg id="79">You do not have to rush to surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what it takes,&quot; she has said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Finally, the child decide with which sex he / she feels / most comfortable - and this is something great.</seg>
		<seg id="82">This allows the child to make the decision for himself.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change</seg>
		<seg id="2">He said Obama has made ​​commendable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the Republican Party</seg>
		<seg id="3">The obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties Site Obamacare, or drone attacks</seg>
		<seg id="4">The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I'm reading a frightfully sad these days book.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This is a book that I thought would encourage me in the gloom of the second year of medicine and would restore me hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I finished the medical reports of my patients at night and I go to bed, this book key back to me when policies inspired millions of people and where speeches were breathtaking.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election ended in a landslide victory and presenters newspapers news took time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the papers they found.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionaries advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During the Obama transition before taking office in 2008, he had 82% approval rating.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Return to this is a rude awakening is like waking from a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The change has really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I put the Obama credit great achievements since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) until the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of &quot;neither seen nor known&quot; and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation in the field of immigration reform, the public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after repeatedly defended the Obama administration to face my peers and colleagues, I am unable to provide an explanation.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I'm on the verge of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Republican filibuster can not explain the tapping foreign leaders, nor the aliens attack innocent children by drones.</seg>
		<seg id="24">She can not explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who disclose government wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It can not justify the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen without trial or evasion of public funding and exceeding authorized spending during presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It can not justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce to silence the media are &quot;more aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And, more recently, it can not excuse the failure to design a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act was ratified.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know if this is what I expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable because the political opposition and the events that occur by chance, as the massacre of Newton party influence our public conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However, all the examples I listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">This is what bothers me the most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I have to vote for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney had a confused and poorly refined alternative that does not seem possible to determine its policies or positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I felt Obama was elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, held the promise that we heard about for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Yet, while the index of favorable opinions dipped below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me wish that the many promises are gone.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week, I read part of the book describes how Obama has suffered huge losses to Clinton in Pennsylvania Primary.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At a meeting post-campaign, he told his team that they had to get back on track and stay loyal to their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want us recentrions our talent,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We must remember who we are.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Here we are 5 years later, Mr. Speaker, and I'm not agree with you.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The United States are sometimes went &quot;too far&quot; in espionage, recognized the Secretary of State, John Kerry, in the first admission of Washington in full debate with Europe on the massive collection of data by the Agency national security (NSA).</seg>
		<seg id="2">After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official admits explicitly controversial practices in NSA interception of communications and data Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;In some cases, I admit, as did the President, some of these actions have gone too far and we will ensure that this happens more in the future,&quot; said John Kerry during ' a conference in London in which he participated from Washington Thursday, October 31 via video link.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In his speech broadcast in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and data collection by the need to combat terrorism and prevention against possible attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in Madrid in March 2004, and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had been foiled many planned attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and gathering information.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We have been prevented from falling aircraft, as buildings explode and people are murdered, because we were able to be aware of these upstream projects,&quot; argued the head of the diplomacy U.S..</seg>
		<seg id="7">And John Kerry said at the Europeans, &quot;I assure you that in the process of innocent people were not deceived.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">But we strive to gather information.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;And yes, in some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately&quot; still allowed the Secretary of State, who had already had to comment on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He said Thursday night that President Obama was &quot;committed to try to clarify and he proceeded to review these practices so that no one feels cheated.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The newspaper, citing documents obtained from the ex-NSA consultant Edward Snowden says the baptized &quot;MUSCULAR&quot;, and carried out with the British counterpart of the NSA program, GCHQ allows these two agencies retrieve data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.</seg>
		<seg id="14">To believe one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the single month of January - from metadata on e-mail, text elements or audio or video documents.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These interceptions take place outside the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, have revealed that the NSA had intercepted massive data and communications from allies of the United States and its leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .</seg>
		<seg id="18">Face the wrath of European countries and while leaks in the American press claimed that the U.S. President was not aware of such plays, Barack Obama has refused to speak about it, citing national security.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For cons, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, he denied that his intelligence agency has picked up tens of millions of European citizens communications.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He even returned the ball to European intelligence services that would be seized of these communications, before providing the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This would involve &quot;military operations&quot; in countries where NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this does not would target Europe, the general said Alexander.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And the controversy extended Friday Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network which has also attracted the ire of China.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Studies show that young African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be a trigger of precocious puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and health issues in children.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A mother should she worry if the breasts and pubic hair of her daughter start to grow 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, Soil endocrinologist, said that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards puberty,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious signs of development, such as the budding breasts, the hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odor, appear earlier in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there has been a slight advance of the age of menarche in the past four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, when he was 12 years three quarters in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Once the chest began to grow, it takes at least two or three years before menarche appear,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also the author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This common Problem &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test to find out how you expect puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty but it is considered &quot;early&quot; when breast development is accompanied by a sudden increase before the age of 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, development slows down or stops - this is something that a pediatrician can monitor.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Faster evolution can justify tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems like tumors or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are treatments to delay the onset of menarche and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and short stature in adulthood.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations on drug and hormone therapy are based on age, the rate of development, growth and emotional maturity child.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is careful with medications but recognizes that &quot;the control of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feel for girls to be different from others.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other major problem is understandable: Parents just do not want their young girls have their rules.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although there were signs and we talked about rules, it was not prepared emotionally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She came home from school frightened and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many theories brought to the attention of the public on the causes of precocious puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">However, there is no coherent theory that the hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are responsible.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Boys like girls reach puberty earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz says that the most plausible hypothesis is that the obesity epidemic.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years linking the percentage of fat in the onset of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, the young African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions in climate, through the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another problem: Although boys have facial hair and the younger pubic area, the trend towards a true precocious puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors attending the conference PAA emphasized the complexity of the subject.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among infants and toddlers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We must be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at Children's Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician to know how to talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you remain calm, your child will react well in general.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls with precocious puberty should be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="4">Held for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Marc Feret and Pierre Legrand were released Tuesday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">After medical examinations of the Val-de-Grâce Wednesday afternoon military hospital, they have since reunited with their families.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And try gradually to resume the course of their lives.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association &quot;Hostages of the world.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">On the evening of your release, you were on the set of 20h of &quot;Antenne 2&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">What are your memories of today's release?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Including on-site in Beirut.</seg>
		<seg id="11">When I am free, I found in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He told me &quot;it is released,&quot; but I'm not sure, and tell me that you can still be killed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">We are very excited, but also very tight.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They lay us on the edge of a sidewalk.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There Syrian military.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Then we arrive at the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Lead us to the French embassy of France.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This is the time of the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the media ...</seg>
		<seg id="20">I remember taking a bath for one hour.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And having dinner in t-shirt to the Embassy of France.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marchiani.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate us to the airport of Larnaca in Cyprus.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu Solenzara where Pasqua ships.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How did you arrive on French soil?</seg>

		<seg id="28">It's a bit brutal.</seg>
		<seg id="29">There is an incredible rush.</seg>

		<seg id="31">When I left there were three TV channels.</seg>
		<seg id="32">I come back and there are plenty.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The descent of the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, this is extremely strong emotion.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Between the airport and home, many bikes after our car Roussin conduit.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The bikers pull the floss to take pictures and follow me home where I do a little police to prevent certain to rise.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The media pressure is enormous.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It does not stop, we are well placed to know ...</seg>
		<seg id="38">But the state of emotion and fatigue is that it is difficult to see clearly.</seg>
		<seg id="39">It leaves a hole and we are suddenly in the media spotlight.</seg>
		<seg id="40">It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to manage.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But it was the hardest.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The same evening, I'm 20h, the next day so I'm on TV.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Then begins a kind of readjusting to life very gently for a month or two that are a bit like a vacation.</seg>
		<seg id="44">How were medical examinations and debriefing DGSE?</seg>
		<seg id="45">I got a first medical examination in Corsica.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce the following days my return radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.</seg>
		<seg id="47">This is not a session that does everything but we know we can count on him, remember if necessary, we are not left to ourselves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">It's part of the procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="49">I also met the intelligence services.</seg>
		<seg id="50">They asked me questions about the hostage takers.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It was logical.</seg>
		<seg id="52">It did not bother me.</seg>
		<seg id="53">How do you react today the release of four hostages in Niger?</seg>
		<seg id="54">I listen to what is being said.</seg>
		<seg id="55">The debate on such ransoms.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Some things annoy me, others less so.</seg>
		<seg id="57">I try to distinguish between the things about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the association &quot;Hostages of the world&quot; that allows me to put distance, and seems much more interesting address.</seg>
		<seg id="58">I wonder, for example, the definition of resilience.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Above all, I fight with others, to recognition of the legal status of the hostage.</seg>
		<seg id="60">There is in my opinion a problem of semantics.</seg>
		<seg id="61">Must qualify the hostage of &quot;political&quot; hostages - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to access to justice, to complain and to bring their policy holders hostages before the International Criminal Court.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and looks forward to the release of these hostages.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But who said that the hostages could perhaps have also access to justice?</seg>
		<seg id="64">A court in The Hague is made ​​for this.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Why do not you say to hostage takers &quot;you violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, it will bring you to justice?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="66">It seems to me, however founded, legitimate hit sense.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This message is heard but not listened to, and it offends me.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: Bursting of Europe gives the choice to the Scots</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another disturbing story of independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, it warns us that an independent Scotland would have to join the European area of freedom of movement in order to join the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">And now we hear stories of passport control at Berwick and a border of barbed son along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
		<seg id="4">While the newspaper Strathclyde said the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it does not yet appear in the headlines (and it was expected).</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nor did not say that the EU Member States spend much of their time around their formal rules when it suits them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in exchange for whatever she wants to get the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So this is a story that is not a.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And if it is ancient history now fixed: I heard for the first time the canard that &quot;independence means passport control&quot; there are more than 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">However, we forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of a dusty old tale.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why an independent Scotland should it follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why exchange the yoke of London against that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here is the real news about Europe: the great postwar plan to unify Europe is definitely stalled.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the crisis of the euro, the European Project is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Across Europe, the parties opposed to the EU or who advocate the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic party in Germany, founded only this year and out of nowhere, attracted nearly five million votes in federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) of the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There has always been a national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, the current economic crisis was a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the associated yoke on national economies through membership in the single currency, has led many people to think that the European project has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The euro crisis has not much to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - this was true only for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The European system rather imposes on its members in exchange rates favorable to German exporters - that German politicians want to keep.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are left with a problem of intrinsic productivity vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only recourse is to make deep cuts in wages and public spending - encouraged by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Following the &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - are a reason to subsidize French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more gas as the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It is a crippling disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry to be hit by a U.S. shale gas cheap.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Accordingly, the resistance is growing, particularly in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a means of controlling Germany and Paris put on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin does not need passport to Paris as its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy undermined struggle.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result: the far-right party Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has won a crucial election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - a timely warning to the British Labour Party who reminds him he can not assume that a split on the right automatically favor the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What is Marine Le Pen with his new popularity with the French white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use European elections next year to create a single currency and anti-anti-European in the European Parliament bloc.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the anti-European parties are doing well in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here's what I think: very soon, the anti-European sentiment and anti-single currency in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that is more like a &quot;Europe of Nations (sovereign)&quot; free privileged by General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, France and Southern Europe find their own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that the UK takes its distance from this project, and I hope it will make eyes at the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, the growing interest in Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left out in the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">And Scotland in?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can decide to be a region of Little England (mostly).</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests, including sending walking Berlin and Brussels.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I think Scotland could live a freer Europe Agreement provided that we keep our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a Europe of non-federal Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should emulate Norway and maintain our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP Scottish Government is - and it should be noted - the anti-austerity has been most successful in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on his opposition to the proposed cuts (and made political movement implemented) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Labour Alistair Darling and Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous now Scotland vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in your car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">While planners of the road network of the United States are struggling to find the money to repair the highway infrastructure in disrepair, many people who see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches to the top dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Devices, which record all miles traveled by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices planning to revamp the outdated system of financing major U.S. highways.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The sector generally uninteresting planning pillars suddenly caused a very animated and alliances turbulent debate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby the government to use small boxes to keep track of your miles, and possibly the road you are traveling on, and then use the information to write a tax bill.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Tea Party is appalled.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern regarding the protection of privacy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And while members of Congress fail to agree on whether to continue, many states have not waited.</seg>
		<seg id="8">How they look during the next decade, they will move to a system allowing drivers to pay according to the number of miles traveled.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists have already embarked those black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system for an experimental trip.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This is really essential for our nation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It is not as if we had a choice,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, general manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the State begin recording the miles traveled by each motorist California 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be change in the way we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there to do.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund in the country, financed with taxes that Americans pay at the pump is financially dry.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Americans are not buying as much fuel as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars can go more miles with a gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians are reluctant to raise taxes, even 1 percent, while gas prices are high.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gas tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a specialist in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His state recently installed tracers 500 cars to test a payment system mile.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;This appears to be the most logical long-term alternative,&quot; he has said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Wonks call it a user fee for mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is not surprising that the idea deceive urban liberals, since taxes could be used to modify driving habits in order to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">California planners interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the ambitious goals set out in the laws of the state of global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, said he also considered the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Proponents of free market Reason Foundation also like the idea of charging drivers per mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;It is not simply a tax rushing into a big black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People pay more directly for the benefits that are afforded to them.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Secretaries of Transportation, which in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go in the way of payment mile.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The U.S. Senate approved a pilot project of $ 90 million last year which would have covered about 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the Speaker of the House killed the proposal, addressing the concerns of legislators representing rural voters who must travel many miles every day to get to work or around town.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Nevertheless, several states and cities are making progress on their side.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry the largest country experience.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon pay the State fee mileage instead of gasoline taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The city of New York is considering a.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois tried a test on a limited number of trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) examines how it could implement the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal success.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers motorists have recently equipped the car with a device, drivers were worried that the government can track their every move.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about Big Brother and what kind of things are a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic performance management in the Department of Transportation Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">This is not something that people want.</seg>
		<seg id="43">From the beginning of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to transform these devices tracking devices in their own right. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is not necessary to build one that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of daily comings and goings of people huge and cumbersome technology infrastructure.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of the few states that are now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location nor the hour.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If we can do that, said Khan, citizens will be more comfortable.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up in California called True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Originally, the company does not intend to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She tried to break into the emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers pay based on their mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But devices that test planners liked the main roads because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information downloaded periodically by modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People are more likely to do that if you do not register their speed and do not locate,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Big mistakes were made in the pilot programs in certain states.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are much cheaper ways and less intrusive methods to proceed.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, planners are experimenting by offering different drivers choice.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose a unit with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">They can still choose to have no camera at all, preferring instead to pay based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state plan.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Other states hope to sell the concept to unsuspecting citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In the city of New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a system of taxation that would be also equipped to pay parking fees, provide insurance &quot;payment driving&quot; and create a set of data on the real-time speed from other drivers and motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists are encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,&quot; said a document on urban development.</seg>
		<seg id="60">However, some transportation planners wonder if the whole debate on pay per mile is not just a huge distraction.</seg>
		<seg id="61">At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the Bay Area of San Francisco, officials say that Congress could easily manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="62">A single extra fee or annual may be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so that everyone pays their fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when simply need aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent ice world based jellyfish.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a light snack.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists chemically recreate the brilliant protein.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Ice cream reacts with language by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the more it becomes shiny.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Charlie, the founder of ice &quot;Lick Me I'm Delicious&quot;, said: &quot;This is something unbelievable but we are still at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g this thing cost about £ 200. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The protein we use in ice reacts with language neutral pH.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice begins to shine.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all the Halloween time because it gives a special shine effect.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This is probably the most expensive I have created because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold ice.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Each ball so cost me about £ 140.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But it has pretty good taste!</seg>
		<seg id="13">The company with the experimental approach of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream flavors such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But his next creation will be even more ambitious.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He added: &quot;I would really like to develop an invisible ice. &quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Edward Snowden, the informant of U.S. intelligence, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.</seg>
		<seg id="2">German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele Thursday met Mr. Snowden in Russia, where it enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In a letter that the member has presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: &quot;While the results of my efforts has been any positive evidence, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as an escape and seeks to penalize political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, the truth is not a crime.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he was accused of espionage and theft of government property.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will work to make this possible. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained as a result of complaints that the NSA had wiretapped the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thomas Oppermann, the member who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as &quot;witness without endangering and completely ruin the relationship with the United States &quot;, he had to take.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr. Ströbele, German Green member, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.</seg>
		<seg id="11">During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr. Ströbele said, according to the lawyer of former consultant of the NSA, Mr. Snowden would not return to Russia if he left the country.</seg>
		<seg id="13">If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, it would assure him that he would be &quot;security&quot; there, said the MP.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a campaign of persecution &quot;serious and sustained&quot; that forced him to leave his country.</seg>
		<seg id="15">However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to &quot;my act of political expression.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphins off the northern coast of Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Thibaut Bouveroux responsible for scientific mission to the Centre for the Study and Conservation of Marine Animals and Backgrounds (OCEAMM) returns to The Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin you she surprised?</seg>
		<seg id="3">This is good news, but it does not surprise me particularly.</seg>
		<seg id="4">While in the past, species have been described and identified on morphological basis, anatomical and geographical today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge of science of classifying species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It is also not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology challenge the classification or membership of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of morphological differences between species.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today, some of these rankings are questioned because of advances in genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Similarly, two morphologically very similar species were distinguished by genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is the case of the new species which has just been identified.</seg>
		<seg id="10">There ten years, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this sub-family: Pacific humpback dolphins and humpback whales in the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Recent analyzes have identified four species.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Why is it an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?</seg>
		<seg id="13">From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">If this population was already long known by the researchers, they did not know it was part of a new species, present only at that location.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or catch arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of more widespread species on Earth.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A species is considered threatened or endangered in the number of individuals existing on Earth, that is to say, the stock, and the potential it has to recover from neighboring stocks.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Regarding the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species is discovered after his stock is automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?</seg>
		<seg id="20">Marine mammals are at the top of the food chain.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They live in homogeneous habitats, open, where there is many genetic exchange between populations and individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Conversely, the more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can lead ultimately create new species.</seg>
		<seg id="24">You should know that the marine environment is the least well-known areas.</seg>
		<seg id="25">We prefer to send robots to Mars than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea</seg>
		<seg id="26">More money is spent in the search for life on other planets in marine research and it is high time that changed.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Bombardier Inc., Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday under pressure from a drop in orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual issues in his division Trains .</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bombardier, based in Montreal, did not provide data for test flight for its new CSeries aircraft or any information as to whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule of commercial operation before September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the inaugural flight of the test there about a month and a half flight, it has flown three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track .</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results were not up to the expectations and the share price fell by 8% to the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, Thursday lowered its rating from &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;performance area&quot; due to the low potential upside of the stock market in the next quarter or the next two quarters.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;While the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed with the margin in the Transportation Division,&quot; said Cameron Doerksen in a note to clients.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as and when the flight test program progresses.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, if no new order is announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will catapult into the lower one today dominated by Boeing and Airbus market segment.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test flight was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the number of firm orders for the CSeries aircraft is modest so far up to 177. It seems that potential buyers waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the claims of the company on energy efficiency and the savings potential of the new airliner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial operation of the first plane.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The leaders also assured analysts and media on Thursday indicating that the program progressed according to schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test flight did not stay on the ground longer than expected,&quot; said Mr. Beaudoin during a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were provided during the time stop the aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Each manufacturer plans differently.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We decided to first flight and provide a period of updating, and that is what we did.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That recur throughout the flight program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test aircraft should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, the company said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer to fly a plane CSeries only 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said it was currently evaluating the timing of entry into service and provide new information in the coming months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slow flight tests - although apparently consistent with internal calendar Bombardier - reinforces our view that the entry into service will be delayed until the first quarter of 2015,&quot; said Doerksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter ended September 30, net income Bombardier dropped to $ 147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $ 172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.</seg>

		<seg id="3">There is no recipe for instructions to pass the invisible wall and reunited with his family.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Then signs appeared.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The first time it was very hard felt his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another time, a gentle awakening at night to look at his watch that never left me, lying on the nightstand.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is the image of my smiling that accompanies me in my everyday gestures father.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Our mother passed away after his grueling fight against cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is at least what I thought the day I found her empty body contorted on the hospital bed with rumpled sheets.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Similarly, his funeral was a frosty farewell focused around lean candlelight framing her coffin.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I thought she was gone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Gradually, by small diurnal or nocturnal apparitions, a little shy, a little erased it quickly back into my mind, evolving gradually as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thought which believed in mourning .</seg>
		<seg id="13">And then she showed me while revealing my own aspects that I had not yet seen, hidden by my relationship with her.</seg>
		<seg id="14">So I learned and realized that I had no person lost my mother but simply a woman I did not really know a woman who embodied this person during his stay in life.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Dying, this woman had the perfect life and paid the person I loved, and now I found her, full.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This detour from the path of my life is the most unexpected and most beautiful.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is a privilege to know that people loved never leave us.</seg>
		<seg id="18">I look like my father, &quot;at home and abroad&quot; seems.</seg>

		<seg id="59">Yet it is there, silent presence, it's there and looks at me.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Every morning I see her worried eyes ask me, I see the dark circles that increase her eyes, fine lines around the lips dig cigarettes, forehead creases that mark the days of anxiety.</seg>

		<seg id="62">And every morning, I looked away.</seg>
		<seg id="63">My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at age 43.</seg>
		<seg id="64">One feels permanently protection, nothing serious can happen to us.</seg>
		<seg id="65">It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile and say his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Of course, I speak to him in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she calls in my dreams when morale is somewhat achieved.</seg>
		<seg id="67">We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the passage of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay on the path that we had drawn.</seg>
		<seg id="68">If you liked to be very strong, no you can not tear the heart and memories.</seg>
		<seg id="69">Somehow, the beloved becomes your inner energy.</seg>
		<seg id="70">I lost my father 22 August 2008 as a result of an asbestos cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="71">I was very close to him, I have always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.</seg>
		<seg id="72">I did not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a baby boy.</seg>
		<seg id="73">If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with its vision.</seg>
		<seg id="74">I also had problems in my work for these convictions.</seg>
		<seg id="75">For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I can not sleep and I always wonder what he thinks.</seg>
		<seg id="76">I do not know if I adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him, is it genetic?</seg>
		<seg id="77">In any event, it will always be my reference.</seg>
		<seg id="78">It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to us.</seg>
		<seg id="79">In short, it is there everyday.</seg>
		<seg id="80">I feel his presence and that makes me happy.</seg>
		<seg id="81">That almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.</seg>
		<seg id="82">I was 28 years old and our son 6 years.</seg>
		<seg id="83">The immense pain which then invaded me was attenuated but of course it is always near me.</seg>
		<seg id="84">Very often he &quot;landed&quot; in my dreams so precisely, so alive that I am waking more sad that it was only a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="85">The other night he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he answer me &quot;I go down&quot; but a voice so real that I woke up with a start, anxious and I turned the bedside looking everywhere, convinced that would happen.</seg>
		<seg id="86">I still live in the same house, and often I feel watching me and I turn to see if it is not there, I know it's him and talk to him.</seg>

		<seg id="3">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected president of the Arab Islamic world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy there 60 years.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He was sworn in before the 18 judges in black dress of the Court in which the building located along the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; said President Morsi during the ceremony broadcast live on public television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Mr. Morsi, an engineer of 60 years formed the United States, from Brothers Muslim fundamentalist group in question for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and severely repressed by successive governments.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Aircraft manufacturers are quarreling about the seat width as large orders are involved</seg>
		<seg id="1">The dispute rages between the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats in the economy class on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow which takes place month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute concerns the width of the proposed long-haul passengers in economy class seats - which are not always the most sought by airlines, but that the allocated space is essential to increase efficiencies in the latest devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This week, Airbus has called the aviation industry to develop a standard requiring a seat height of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that it should be the airlines decide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute erupted when the aircraft manufacturers looking to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping to record orders at the event which runs from November 17 to 21.</seg>
		<seg id="5">How seats will be arranged at the rear of the plane - in particular, there he will be 9 or 10 seats front - is essential for the economic performance of the segment &quot;mini-jumbo&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing says that its &quot;777X&quot; refurbished economy class will accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says that the concurrent version of the A350 will carry 350 economy class seats in 18 inches wide configured in rows 9.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The aerospace giants often trade blows on technical issues by advertising in the trade press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Today, Airbus appeal directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X should take precedence over its competitors with over 100 commands.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It has been realized recently that could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the financial presentation of a photo showing three people against each other in the restaurant titled &quot;Do you accept that? &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing offers long-haul flights in closer in regional turboprop aircraft seats,&quot; said John Leahy, Airbus commercial director.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Such as dietary habits change, people grow, but the seats in airplanes have not changed dramatically.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined the modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from U.S. Department of Health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The waistline of the average American twenty-first century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus said that his rival clings to a seat concept which dates from the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly baptized device &quot;jet set&quot; was closer.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus says it has commissioned a study that indicates that extra inch at the seat width improve the sleep quality of 53%.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing Airbus dispute the figures regarding the width of the seats and says it is not manufacturers to decide how airlines trim fares and equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="18">He also said that the study shows that the experience in the cabin not only depends on the width of the seats.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;This is really to provide flexibility for airlines and allow them to do what they feel they should do to carry out their activities,&quot; said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, it is more to have some freedom of movement, but for suppliers is increasingly an issue that could affect results.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the dispute lies a race aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $ 700 billion in market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of U.S. and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Boeing and Airbus both claim a seat performance in their latest models engined long-haul 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER 365 seats.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The performances by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and 777 original model configured in rows of nine.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The gain in terms of unit cost is low compared to the configured with 10 seats per row unit currently in service.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Boeing did this in order to cram more seats and make its reports more competitive aircraft by our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort in the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins are configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a more dense configuration, which can go with the cheapest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 777,&quot; said the expert in cabin interiors Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers including airlines must choose.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The sellers who had traveled the world with them outweigh even a meter to test competing configurations.</seg>
		<seg id="33">While touting offer comfortable units, all manufacturers also offer aircraft configurations with high density to low-cost airlines and regional trips.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus A350 offers configured with 10 seats per row but says he has not sold yet.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater customization booths offering went on some of its aircraft wider seats side.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say it is unlikely that his call for the aviation industry to develop a standard size for the lead seats, but could forget the sell of 777X.</seg>

		<seg id="14">First there was the &quot;musicals&quot; that evolve with the producers ...</seg>

		<seg id="2">But in his opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said he &quot;had never had to deal with a problem of sexual abuse of children within its organization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Chief Phillip Hare was asked about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with offenses relating to child pornography and a physical education instructor YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mr. Hare said Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, he was aware of the first case but he was not aware of the second.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He also admitted that the opening statement was inaccurate YMCA emphasizing &quot;YMCA external controls were performed and indicated that children's safety was a top priority for the organization. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA was informed that he had received the second worst assessments of four institutions in a quality Department of Education and Communities conducted in August this year audit.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21 years, admitted that personnel management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he failed to ensure that employees know they were required to report any violation of the security policy for children.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was sentenced to 6 years minimum jail.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Mr. Hare has rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing employees to report breaches of the Lord to children's safety.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Staff testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, he kept private, made them sit on his lap, told them he loved them and left playing with his mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, which was framed by Lord and had requested training in child protection because it was concerned about his behavior, said it was responsible for the child care YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, which framed Lord &quot;very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Director General said that he rejected the testimony of staff according to which they were reluctant to report such violations to their supervisor.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord blurred their judgment, so they have not reported his actions.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hare said he had expressed his views to the board of the YMCA of New South Wales stating that, for the organization, the lesson of the &quot;incident Jonathan Lord&quot; should not affect &quot;the reporting &quot;by the staff and the board agreed with him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign staff confidentiality agreements, shortly after allegations were raised, was taken by the CEO of the YMCA responsible for childcare, Liam Whitley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said that the decision was intended to avoid contamination of evidence, but it was an &quot;excess of zeal&quot; and had been poorly implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="18">YMCA of New South Wales was not safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert in sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The closest advisors of President Barack Obama envisioned in the greatest secrecy, to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, the New York Times.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This revelation is the most significant event that appears in the highly anticipated book of 2012 campaign Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and told Thursday that close associates of the President had conducted &quot;extensive work in groups and surveys in late 2011&quot; to see if the foreclosure could help Obama Biden for his re-election when his hopes were dwindling.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to the policy Times correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of officials of the campaign and the White House, namely the former general secretary of the White House, Bill Daley, to measure what effect replacement of the vice president by the former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the election.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been closely guarded in the campaign headquarters in Chicago and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only a half-dozen close advisers of the President - including Daley, the former campaign manager Jim Messina Obama and former advisers to the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that change was under consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Double Down&quot; indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal relationship&quot; before finally deciding against change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list &quot;did not improve significantly the chances of success of Obama. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I said that I considered a range of issues, and this was one of them,&quot; said Daley newspaper.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we said, &quot;Lord, what can we do? &quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">While Daley described the review as &quot;concerted&quot; Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that's reelection campaign had invested heavily to find out if the change would be beneficial at the polls.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;The campaigns do not spend a lot of money in surveys and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking action,&quot; said Martin on AC360.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, we do not know if Obama knew that his team examined the replacement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Martin said on CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the potential redesign.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Although Daley has said he did not think that the president &quot;was aware&quot; of any change, the former general secretary admitted it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Martin added, &quot;Double Down&quot; did not answer definitively the question of whether political polls arrived on Obama's desk.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that the eviction Biden presidential list was examined.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Maybe,&quot; replied Martin.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The British musician has not finished surprising this year.</seg>
		<seg id="2">From The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a deluxe reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Four have already emerged on the Web.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The announcement of the release of a new album of David Bowie had left everyone speechless.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The day of his 66th birthday, Jan. 8, 2013, he said that a new album would come out in March.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, dated 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still count on him to make the glitter pop scene.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A feast for fans</seg>
		<seg id="8">Not tired of surprises, David Bowie was more than one trick up his sleeve with The Next Day.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Thin White Duke has plans to reissue this album on 4 November.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For the occasion, he has concocted a real treat for his fans.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be in the form of three discs: the original album, studio sessions and unreleased remixes and a DVD containing the four clips already disclosed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Next Day Extra contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe Edition, unveiled five songs specially for the occasion, as well as two remixes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">David Bowie has also made ​​presentations of this beautiful box in a video.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He introduced both each disk, but also the accessories supplied with: exclusive photos and folders, a notebook to share their own thoughts, a booklet with lyrics ...</seg>
		<seg id="15">And most importantly, it gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars and a very prominent rock expertly controlled power.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Unpublished already listening</seg>
		<seg id="17">Atomica but is not the only way to reveal its charms.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a light ride that slows gradually giving way to a pop ballad.</seg>
		<seg id="20">On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie he wanted to make a small reference to Rocket Man Elton John, and even Gravity?</seg>
		<seg id="21">With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he is no longer grounded.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Space Oddity, next was much more serious.</seg>
		<seg id="23">On Born In A UFO, David Bowie made ​​a new reference both its strangeness: would he from another planet?</seg>
		<seg id="24">The guitar riffs, seductive, make you want to leave the Earth.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Bowie fun anyway to play the chameleon with these titles: turn informant, a man aboard a rocket, martian potential ...</seg>
		<seg id="26">It conceals and reveals both plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, including his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.</seg>
		<seg id="27">No wonder therefore that it is a mask by hand in the photograph of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, the brand Louis Vuitton, which embodies the new face.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately service Netflix video on demand via their TV in a future that does not seem so distant.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Subsidiary Cogeco said Thursday it was conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly as well as more options interfaces,&quot; said President and CEO of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Cogeco Cable follows the lead of its competitors, such as Bell, even if the subsidiary Cogeco does not have a specific date in regards to this new platform.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We must adapt and change or resist change and fail,&quot; said Mr. Audet.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that if Netflix could offer some technical details that were not mentioned, could be resolved.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the United States, the popular video service said to be in talks with some major cable so that its service is available via their platforms.</seg>

		<seg id="10">Ottawa would force providers cable TV and satellite to offer customers the ability to pay for services a la carte.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It's about two and a half years that we say that the idea of ​​forcing consumers to buy large packages of channels, it does not work,&quot; said Mr. Audet.</seg>
		<seg id="12">However, he hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to some interesting recommendations.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;There will emerge from these discussions a kind of new reference framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy in regard to television,&quot; said CEO Cogeco.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The CRTC is conducting public consultations last week and they should continue with the industry next spring.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Side results, Cogeco has reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 cents a share.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This is a decrease compared to net income of 44.9 million, or 83 cents a share, in the same period last year.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The Montreal-based company said the decline in depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Cogeco acquired in 2012 Atlantic Broadband cable company, established in the United States for $ 1.36 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It was the first major acquisition of the company after which failed in Portugal.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Last December, the Montreal-based company has also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based, for the sum of 526 million Internet provider.</seg>
		<seg id="21">As for income Cogeco, they grew 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.</seg>
		<seg id="22">They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Net income of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 cents per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 cents a share, in the same period last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Cogeco Cable's revenues however increased 45% to $ 470.4 million.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="26">However, for the 2013 fiscal year, the number of customers Cogeco Cable is up 5546.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Mr. Audet does not care to see the number of customers fluctuate so.</seg>
		<seg id="28">For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The European elite is ready to do business with Great Britain?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to meet the business and define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To do this, we ordered the widest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders globally represent all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found that the vast majority of companies now seeking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries modernize and grow while EU countries are stagnating.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcana.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When asked their opinion on specific policy issues - ranging from the regulation of monopolies laws on products - the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key competences should return the hands of Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The single market has caused widespread discontent, companies say that the cost of the Brussels I Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits that it has to be part of the European trade area - 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro -European, even agree.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Finally, and what is even more telling, our survey of business leaders found that a significant majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives in favor of a treaty change and developing a relationship with EU based on trade and not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the corporate world insists a &quot;significant change&quot; that gives power to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are high - achieving change the Treaty and represent the best interests of Britain would see a shift of 16% of votes in favor of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: This survey shows that British companies are supporting this plan to renegotiate the terms of the accession of the UK to the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favor of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is possible and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area on the path to closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses it means putting a new emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach to Brussels .</seg>

		<seg id="1">In a pawnbroker shopping center Bendemeer Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga file a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay the tuition of his daughters.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in,&quot; says Amirthalinga.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although she earns $ 3,000 Singapore ($ 2,400) per month as an administrator and that her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she said.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In fact, demand is such in parts of southeast Asia - where household debt increases - that ValueMax, where she completed her transaction, this week became the third company pawn to be introduced the Singapore Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Pawn jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash - $ 1,300 in Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but it's almost as cheap as the unsecured bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In general, pawnbrokers Singapore levy a just effective annual interest rate of 17%, above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local funding with a branch in the same center business.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage not to require credit checks or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Consequently, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers as families feel the pressure of the rising cost of living and the indebtedness of households and consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by lax monetary policy in advanced economies, families in low and middle income are turning to pawnbrokers to fill the gap while their economies are slowing.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week, the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's cited the rising household debt, primarily due to the increase in mortgage loans as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the household debt / highest Asian gross domestic product ratio.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists also fear the high consumer debt levels in Thailand, which was released this week little technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The result is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [of the wage scale] looking to supplement their income as they can,&quot; said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Historically high gold prices over the last two years that people were quick to pawn their belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore, about 70% of the articles pledged in 200 pawn shops of the city-state are gold.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People say, &quot;the price of gold is high, say pledge gold chain grandma and come back to fetch the next month.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops, EasyMoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The increase is such in the pawnbroking industry that ValueMax operator of the store to Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia - where it already has four stores - but also outside of Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, the Executive Director.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will fund using 60% of the $ 66 million it raised in Singapore this week during his introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some lenders have reduced rates faced criticism for exorbitant interest rates they charge, Miss Yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also that it n do not directly increase the debt.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Customers mortgage assets they already have, and the fact monetize their personal property does not increase in household debt,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Pledging is better accepted socially as a means to get a secured short-term financing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">People who go to pawnbrokers are not only those who have financial problems.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The wealthy Singapore also go into pawn shops ValueMax to pledge gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of the cash purchase price.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see clients from all walks of society.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;It can be wealthy people who need to borrow short-term business activities or investments, or small businesses who needs cash through a difficult period,&quot; adds Ms. Yeah.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Sometimes they just need money very quickly.</seg>

		<seg id="21">During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all captured and collected a sample of her hair.</seg>
		<seg id="22">During interrogation, he said he had an office in his home, as well as his workplace and that sometimes customers call home for legal matters.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the court heard testimony that he called the major players in the drug trade, some of which he represented, after key arrests and say what investigators were aware.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Attorney Anne Whyte said: &quot;If anyone should know that it should not violate the law, it is a criminal lawyer. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer lawyer, and having too involved with individual customers.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of these communications will undoubtedly legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.</seg>

		<seg id="31">It is too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and left compromise his independence.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta denied any illegal act and said: &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer, I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done immediately. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after the hearing, the Superintendent Lee Halstead Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr. Ditta's past criminal lawyer in criminal himself when it began to get drugs from organizations criminal. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">His addiction to cocaine has never compromised and made vulnerable to ulterior motives leading members of organized criminal groups who charge to obtain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Lawyers should uphold the highest standards of integrity and build trust with the public.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Mr Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The unit responsible for serious and organized crime in Lancashire led the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, demonstrating its commitment prosecute criminals to justice.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run by being one of the most popular Asian southeast men, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosives used during the attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It could be released after 15 years on parole.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pope Francis appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Cardinals are men of the highest-ranking church in the Catholic Church after the Pope and those who elected him, so François appoint its first group of men who eventually choose his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are currently 201 cardinal.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, when a cardinal reached the age of 80, he can not participate in the election of a pope - it therefore amounts to a group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all existing cardinals held before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The Pope Francis decided to communicate its decision to convene the consistory of February in advance to facilitate planning other meetings requiring the participation of Cardinals different parts of the world,&quot; said Lombardi.</seg>

		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals around the world to restore the balance,&quot; said he added.</seg>
		<seg id="12">40% Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Cardinals will also be the first to be selected since François formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to examine ways to reform the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Previously, the pope decided alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now, François chose these eight cardinals they help,&quot; said Valero.</seg>

		<seg id="17">But we have never experienced such a situation - it is totally new.</seg>
