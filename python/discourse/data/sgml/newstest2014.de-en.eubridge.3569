		<seg id="7">In the course of my employment in these facilities, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government that led me from a moral duty to act.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw I was exposed to a serious and persistent campaign that forced me to leave my family and my home.</seg>

		<seg id="10">I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.</seg>

		<seg id="13">The benefits to society from these findings is becoming clearer; at the same time, the risks visibly reduced.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Although the result of my efforts demonstrably positive, my government treated dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political expression and put on trial.</seg>
		<seg id="15">However, the truth is not a crime.</seg>
		<seg id="16">I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community that prejudicial attitudes.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Traveling through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care</seg>
		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle free medical care in remote villages in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or with your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 &quot;CNN Heroes of 2013.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 in order to elect him to the &quot;CNN Hero of the Year&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The winner receives $250,000 to continue its work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">21 years, Georges Bwelle of his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First, he had a broken arm, but it was an inflammation, which to his brain and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There was no neuro-surgeon in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We have released him from Cameroon, if we had the money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment that they had to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not easy,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can leave the house at five o &quot;clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first one, and it is not first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are very many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Indeed, some people die because they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In contrast, the ratio is in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But even if there was a doctor for them, could not afford most Cameroonians the visit.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">His father, and so many of his countrymen to see suffer ripened in Bwelle decided to do something about it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations last year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He was a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday and up to 30 people in minibuses and continue with the helpless medical equipment on the roof of unbefestigtes terrain in the villages, need help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
		<seg id="32">More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his broad smile and his boundless energy - the joyful celebration.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We treat 500 people per trip,&quot; Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village and on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these weekend clinics offering medical care in a number of areas.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening, the team simple operations with local anaesthetic.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations are normally held in a school, the City Hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patient and go in the recreation area, in order to make room for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is powered by a generator of the group and Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is an arduous work, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They drum all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has carried out last year, 700 free operations and know that it makes an enormous difference to the people with their work, which helps them.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man explained that the free operation of that he had received enabled him to return to work.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;The changes the future of my family,&quot; the man said.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="51">With this second job he finanziere 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I really do not know when he is asleep,&quot; says Katie O &quot;Malley, who for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily participates in Bwelles group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For medical and nursing students such as O &quot;Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never get at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; explains O 'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The students pay for their trip to Cameroon normally themselves and often donated medical equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is undoubtedly a hero,&quot; says O &quot;Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a burden.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Others to give to a happier life, and thus to fulfill a promise he made to his father, he has a great deal of pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I make this work,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I am thinking of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I do it to get people to laugh and to alleviate the pain.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will be for the first time on 22 February appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Cardinals are the most senior cleric in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are also to elect a pope, Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Currently, there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years, no longer take part in the papal election - which is a group of 120 &quot;&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In a statement, in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman said, there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as a consistory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned,&quot; said Lombardi.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the number of voting cardinals will probably be dropped until February.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He explained that a pope usually take so many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of voting cardinals 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he would like.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The consistory next year is so important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Currently, there is some overhang on the part of Europe, and especially in Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world, in order to restore the balance,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find ways to reform the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Francis has selected eight cardinals who will help him,&quot; said Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He explained that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that the Cardinals Francis ask for advice.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But so far we have not been in this situation - that is all very new.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to Cardinals, but Francis was &quot;full of surprises, so we do not know whom he appoints.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">Europe's elite is ready to do business with the United Kingdom?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care for prosperity and work in Britain, want to change our relations with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To this end, we have been the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, the British company sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exports outside Europe and focuses on countries to modernize and grow, while the states in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="6">that the government of new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favoured, rather than with the long and arduous process, the obscure to reform EU institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Asked about their views on specific legal issues, from antitrust law to product legislation - the majority of the business leaders of the opinion that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was a general dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to the company in the cost of the Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the, which are traditionally the most Europhile.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority wants a course in the direction of change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU, which is based on trade, not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This realization that is used in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot;meaningful change,&quot; which brings the tiller back to Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is about much - a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain at 16 percent would lead to a change of view in favor of the EU in a referendum.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK's conditions for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that the companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving in the direction of a closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which means for companies with a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are linked to the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government can not waste the money of the state.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take &quot;immediate measures&quot; to avert a crisis that has been caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The funding for a period of four years, it was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe that the unique challenges faced by the federal government,&quot; Plibersek said today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Further 2600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for grey Star, residues are to be eliminated.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,&quot; said Tanya Plibersek.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A three-member commission will be set up and is designed to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As Wilkie said today, the $325 million dollars of little use if &quot;they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless, he praised the government for the fact that they have responded to his request for urgent aid, which he first expressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the public health system in the state of the list of concerns,&quot; said Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the federal government, the state electoral services are largely offset the recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the health spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a &quot;Band-Aid solution.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;We are in today's situation, because the Labor state government $430 million from the health system,&quot; he said on ABC TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It is not that a state government almost half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million and then pretend that the good news.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The appeal court heard the arguments on Tuesday the suspension.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The report said that the judge had to be released from the case because they have violated the code of conduct for American judge, is determined that a judge is to avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements, in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bombing in Bali, reacted angrily at the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was brought to, as Umar Patek should be shot in their opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who was nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">With punitive suspension, he could be released after 15 years.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A guilty verdict in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if they can apply for the man who, because of its reputation as a wordless bomb maker known as &quot;Demolition Man,&quot; could have requested the death penalty.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his Mitverschwörern almost ten years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Fighting back tears, she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;We should put him in front of a firing squad,&quot; said Corteen to AAP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I have to live with every day that I will get no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Sari Club was razed to the ground, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck that was parked in front of the nightclub.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bombers explode a backpack filled with explosives.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and &quot;died&quot; three times while he was on a life support system.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hughes said Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
		<seg id="18">To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds, is not much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was in court.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He cheated nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces less than four months later, the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killed.</seg>

		<seg id="23">Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much pain he has caused to other people.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15% drop in net profit, after he was caught by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bombardier, based in Montreal, a flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information on whether the plane could go under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the maiden flight test aircraft followed one and a half months, so far, only three more starts, which the question of whether the testing phase is proceeding as planned.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of &quot;outperform&quot; from &quot;sector perform&quot; in view of the fact that the stock in the next one to two quarters of a limited course potential.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Although weaker delivery figures were expected to aircraft, but the margins of development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed,&quot; Doerksen said in a client.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries, if the test program is progressing on the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If, however, no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the aircraft series of CSeries can catapult the company into the market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test plane was presented to the public in March, after months of delays and flew for the first time in September.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But so far are binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers want to wait and see the results of the flight tests whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new commercial jet aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The company said on Thursday with analysts and media in addition, the program is in the schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test aircraft is no longer than expected, on the ground,&quot; said Beaudoin during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft were ground tests and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Each manufacturer is planning.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, what we have done.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This is happening throughout the flight programme.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, analysts remain sceptical as to whether 12 months after the maiden flight of the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft in operation.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said it checked the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and will update this in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015,&quot; Doerksen said.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter with the end on 30 September Bombardiers net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The adjusted earnings per share is unchanged 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Sales slipped slightly, and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Net orders fell from 83 to 26.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September, and was unchanged compared with December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In the field of aerospace, the results were in the framework of our targets, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing,&quot; said Beaudoin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this area has increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The order book in the transport sector, on September 30, $32.6 billion dollars and was slightly increased to 31 December.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The profit margin in the field of transport has been hampered by handling problems in some big contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier shares by 8.5 percent and stood at 4,83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardiers closest rival, reported a 10% drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The air traffic control authority CASA also declared that they will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the of a dog with his mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with the tail stretched more to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to it.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;In humans is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere react differently to stimuli, positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here, we have tried to look at this in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He also noted that in dogs as in humans, the right brain hemisphere for the movement of the left side is responsible and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs on the side of their, the researchers monitored the animals, while saw these films of other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed the behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">We will soon understand why the tail in the first, in the other direction</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate ablenkende other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">If the animals looked like an otherwise ausdrucksloser dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedelnden dog), they remained completely relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But it was the tail to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wag), their increased heart rate and they looked restless.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate with each other through these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience that movements they should worry or not.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He said: &quot;If you have several encounters with other dogs and a swish with the tail in one direction is associated with friendly behavior and the right side, a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of this experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada: &quot;Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog, if his tail wag on the left and the right not to be restless, rather than the other way around, as in the Italian study.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to his testimony, the differences could stir, therefore, that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the movies or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study of how dogs respond to real dogs, could help, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;Although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined, and dogs are no exception,&quot; said Bradshaw.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Since their behavior record, but simply put, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one, sometimes in the opposite direction.</seg>

		<seg id="4">A well-known criminal defense lawyers, warned of a drug baron in front of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Kriminalisten as a &quot;first-class&quot; vaunted lawyer nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011, after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Officials watched as Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire,, while it was the with colleagues during a meal.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The investigations have revealed that regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All four suspects were monitored by the police as part of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They, along with 32 other people were arrested after the police in a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction can be publicised.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today,, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at Liverpool Crown Court after weeks of two counts of obstruction of justice, found guilty and sentenced.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He admitted the cocaine possession in a previous survey.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The lawyer was convicted after the police found in their investigations of Scarborough, that he had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with disappointment.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the dustbin of the lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, called Scarborough regularly with preferring, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer returned home, the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In court, it became known that was a &quot;regular consumer&quot; of cocaine, after tests of class A drugs were discovered in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He was later arrested, but denied to take cocaine and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because this was his client, and claimed that their discussion, &quot;lawyer secret.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and he was taken from a hair sample.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The police interrogation, he admitted, he both under his home address and an office in the workplace and clients would call him at home because of legal issues.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In court, it became known that he is in the drug trade, some of which he had previously called for significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about it.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else, does not break the law.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">He is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer, because he has too much with certain clients.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But that went far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.</seg>
		<seg id="29">He was the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr preferring brought his profession into disrepute.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed that his independence was compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing and claimed: &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait for 15 hours, but do it immediately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after the hearing, said Lee Halstead, superintendent of police in Lancashire: &quot;Mr preferring has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal when he began to buy drugs from organised criminals.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
		<seg id="36">He has betrayed that trust and trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire headed the investigation against, which led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This case should serve as a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and bring you to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Thirty-five people were sentenced to total fines of 153 years for drug offences.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey, the News of the World heard in May 2005 a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his &quot;attractive special adviser&quot; Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The newspaper commissioned the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voice mails, and pursued them, but Coulson called and left messages, such as the court was told.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;According to the public prosecutor's office is Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to catch them red-handed, but one that people are faced with a history to see their reaction,&quot; said Edis.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He said that NotW use three methods to investigate stories citizen investigators: Phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The publisher is personally involved in the third method.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Obviously he knows of the second, the, it cannot be.</seg>
		<seg id="8">What about the first?</seg>
		<seg id="9">He knows about the phone-hacking?</seg>
		<seg id="10">He denies that, but we say: &quot;And whether he knew about it.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">Rumors of an affair Clarke's first feature of the editors of NotW, as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby, said: &quot;Do not waste your time, it is with Charles.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="13">The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective on the Pawlby and her sister were stored as &quot;projects&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">At the time the searches were the grandparents of Pawlby anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby.</seg>
		<seg id="16">On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a voicemail with the following content: &quot;I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, I would like to talk with Charles.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">Edis said Coulsons activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett was due to an affair with a married woman, when he was with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: Grow up faster</seg>
		<seg id="1">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white age, as studies show.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes mean not directly puberty</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A mother should be worried if her daughter grow at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and pubic hair?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - normally, this is not a sign that is now fast puberty,&quot; explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor, with girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstruation) in the last 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;If the development of breasts, it takes at least two to three years to the,&quot; said Kaplowitz, author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: The essential guide to deal with this problem frequently occurring.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test, which is progressing puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is controversial, which is actually the onset of puberty, but it is &quot;precocious,&quot; if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process slowed down or stalled – something that can monitor a pediatrician.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For faster progress could be by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors and cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small stature in adults.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations for a medical or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psycho-social aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: &quot;The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters have the period.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side,&quot; Kaplowitz said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter has received with ten days.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even if there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, they were not prepared emotionally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She was scared and excited by the school home because it was the first in her group of friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Young are similar girls before puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He supported girls on the implementation of a study in 2001 at the age of six to nine years, which establishes a connection between body fat and entering puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be rather than their white age.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are different reasons for this.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions on the climate to the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hairs earlier, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors on the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even babies and young children.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their doctor, how they should talk to their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;This may mean that you have a conversation earlier than expected,&quot; advised Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you stay calm, the child is usually good.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls who early bloom, need the insurance, the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens sooner than expected.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 accusations against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But the opening statement before the Commission had declared the YMCA, &quot;in the organization never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee for offences had been charged with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse of children entrusted to him had been convicted.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission assistierenden lawyer that he had known of the first case, but the second was not known.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He acknowledged that the YMCA opening statement to the Commission was also vague on the assertion that &quot;there was external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he is the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) has received in August of this year.</seg>

		<seg id="9">He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that employees have to report violations in relation to the Lords regarding the safety of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The employees said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she worked as a babysitter, they sit on his lap, said that he had loved it, and children play with his mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord, who had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat, who was at the YMCA Caringbah the supervisors Lords daunting, &quot;and most of the time was very remote.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The CEO said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Instead, he said, have affected their friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organisation from the Jonathan Lord incident &quot;, not&quot; affects reporting &quot;by staff, and the board voted to approve him.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">A new day, a new horror story to independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In fact, it was in the Strathclyde template pointed to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was - as expected - played no role in the headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">No one has also mentioned that the EU member states often bent their strict rules, if it is convenient for them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">That is not really a story.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And one that is already happened in the years that it already looks like a fossil: The, the first time I have heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; duck at least 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is an interesting point in the constant refrain of this ancient history.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that dances to the tune of Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why the London yoke against the trade from Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">These are the real European news: The large, taken after the war plan to the unification of Europe is stalled.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Throughout the EU parties are gaining ground, the EU or the euro as a common currency to throw overboard.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party founded Alternative for Germany - until this year - nearly five million votes in the federal election in September, and distribute effectively, the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The current economic crisis, it is a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in connection with the straitjacket, forced into the national economy by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits - that was the case in Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters - and the German politicians would like to.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency will take place in southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of the imposed by Brussels &quot;green&quot; energy policy - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All the world protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American shale gas.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">However, Berlin, Paris does not need more than a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which the ailing French economy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU anti-National Front has just won a key by-election and the ruling Socialists in three.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen, with their newly gained popularity among the white working-class French?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-EU currency bloc in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and it is very possible for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come to the abolition of the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it is something like the &quot;Europe&quot; (sovereign) nations favored General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and a few of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that Great Britain distanced itself from the project, hoping to curry favour with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Where is Scotland in all this?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can decide to be a region of (ultimately).</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests - including Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland could go in a looser European Grouping quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of the Nations easier.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should consider it emulate Norway and keep our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has 2011 spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and) cuts made by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence, only to be imposed by Berlin and Brussels austerity.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no phone calls)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Passengers can now hear from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading, activities, games, music and use the prestige of films, but not with the mobile phone, according to the new guidelines, which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly they would be implemented, would depend on the respective airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The airlines need to prove that the FAA aircraft to meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the arrangements for the storage of the devices, according to the new rules.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said that she had already received by some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Under these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA announced in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers must switch smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">You may not start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers, and the captain gives the green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the entrance to the, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again, before the plane landed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are secured against electronic malfunctions could allow its passengers to use the devices, landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi in, should meet the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;If the new regulation is implemented, and we are working closely with the airline, both sides will benefit from it,&quot; said Glading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We are to be honest, we feel like watchdogs on this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometers, the agency explained.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers are urged to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So there is still no &quot;words With Friends,&quot; the scrabble classified online game that the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines, because he refused to shut down the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain banned.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The regulatory authority for telephone conversations at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA lifts may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still seen as a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause problems in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that can disrupt the transfer from the air,&quot; said Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An advisory committee of the industry, which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCas kill from Missouri are of the opinion that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In some studies, up to one-third of the passengers, the closure of the device or ignored.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communications equipment of passengers bears FM radios were, the latest technology trend.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices are generally much less radio radiation than previous generations.</seg>
		<seg id="36">E-mail reader, for example, give only minimal radiation, if you umblättert.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But when downloading or sending data transmission values are stronger.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among the supporters of an easing of restrictions on the devices use by passengers is Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, invited an airliner full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but could not.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk in the use of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers Association passenger said he was of the opinion that the disruption of the device is real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots who did speak for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to mandate in instrument landing under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the devices by the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a sensible adjustment for travelers who today would be equipped with technology.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that it is not a pleasant passenger experience is to safety,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Between leading aircraft manufacturers, it is a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute revolves around the seat width, passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the most airlines, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should be decided by.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of its twin-engine long-haul planes, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As the rear part of the aircraft, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results indicated that, which is to deliver the new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; design.</seg>

		<seg id="12">In the light of changed eating habits are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, has the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 percent, the data from the US Health Ministry.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Taillenumfang male average American is in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized &quot;jet Set&quot; was narrow.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It was, as Airbus, that showed that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat, the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputes the figures Airbus to the seat and says it is not to decide at the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The company also explains, according to the experience in the aircraft of more than the seat width.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It is really boils down to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful,&quot; explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">You do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, there is more elbow, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the export performance of the US or Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products,&quot; says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing feature indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Eighteen inches of legroom would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view from the Airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777,&quot; said Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin no direction, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines can choose.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The world-travelling jet sellers even tape measure, the establishment of the competition.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Even if they extol the convenience, but all manufacturers also offer jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers an A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but has not yet been sold, according to its own account.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of greater adaptability of the cabin and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but it could distract from the wave of 777X-sales.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Veganism is the vegetarianism, differs from this, but in a very significant way.</seg>
		<seg id="1">While vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a Veganers.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan from all consumption of animal products, including honey is denied.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What remains, one might wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan food world through a considerable ingenuity.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Sandwich spreads are very popular,&quot; said Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the local reform House, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For 13 years, the native New Zealanders vegan, he finds in (almost) everything he needs to live. &quot;In 1997, I asked my diet and became a vegetarian.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">At the turn of the century, then the next step and I was vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice,&quot; says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He acknowledged that there is no animal products in other everyday concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First and foremost is his vegan ethics.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I do not want to see animals must die for me,&quot; says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, which covers the entire consumer behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Instead of burgers, hinterherzutrauern scrambled eggs or rubber bears, I have discovered a new products, the enthusiasm.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;It is a double bonus,&quot; says Proctor today, &quot;in fact, vegan no surrender, no asceticism, but it is an asset.&quot; The assumption that the man with the selection of dining options, Proctor leads on the power of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And it is precisely these conditions could also fail some well-intentioned attempt.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The addiction is a crucial factor, which leaves many give up quickly, similar to smoking,&quot; Proctor is a comparison.</seg>
		<seg id="16">And: &quot;Certain tastes are not on the animal.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is often the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;But you can also produce the same effect in other ways,&quot; the vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="19">At a barbecue Proctor, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Vegan sausages.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He is supposed to a balanced and varied diet, the taste.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;It should taste, but it is not only to reduce animal food,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that, he had not suffered.</seg>
		<seg id="24">For me, the change has had a positive aspect.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I am no stranger to cholesterol and have a higher vitamin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are high-performance athletes who eat vegan exclusively.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;My blood values are well, I am often check,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus critics.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Because animals are fed with feed, rather than graze on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 share is high,&quot; Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;My B12 values are in order,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Proctor must not go for food procurement.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Everything I need, I find on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="35">And I buy something special.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Many people overlook the fact that it is only the finished products are expensive, but that is the&quot; ordinary &quot;finished products.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="37">In any case, the preparation of our dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;In the home kitchen, there is a lot to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not better results,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also bring his in-laws.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Family firm of the vegan gives a new condiment.</seg>
		<seg id="41">This dynamic, when you cook together, has a new significance.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;The situations that can arise are as diverse as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="43">He was, of course, but also scepticism.</seg>
		<seg id="44">You enjoy my food?</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;I feel bad because I drank milk?&quot; - of this kind must be as vegans with tact.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;I do not reject people, yes, I am part of this society,&quot; Proctor would not enclaves.</seg>
		<seg id="47">And the everyday world seems to be not so vegan as - and not the in everyday life, as is commonly believed.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Even fast food is allowed.</seg>
		<seg id="49">There are everywhere!</seg>
		<seg id="50">&quot;Many Döner offer falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In a pizzeria he differs on pasta dishes, or a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="52">The restaurants are so slow.</seg>
		<seg id="53">&quot;When I started 13 years ago, vegan to feed me, everything was much more difficult,&quot; the New Zealanders can find a development: &quot;You must talk to the people, they.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="54">&quot;If enough, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,&quot; he hopes.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or café bird free.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Proctor has the desire that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Basically, vegan dishes for everyone.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Meat dishes are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they are different from,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way, from the outset,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="61">But the shopping veganer products can be a little difficult at the beginning.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Especially when you learn to understand that the additives in animal peanuts as color donors can leave seems to comply with the ethics with so many hurdles and traps quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: &quot;Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives,&quot; explains the many ingredients, but the food is also.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot;Gradually developed a scanner and knows the signs and logos,&quot; it is sometimes better to do than small steps to stop or to stumble, &quot;says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="65">The vegan, he is an important moral signal, to raise awareness.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Perhaps he can't quite that playing his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime of nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Before tests on humans will be needed before tests, which can take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the first results are good.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried and tried to stop all methods available on the market, but saw that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,&quot; said Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus infected selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies to the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which is a smoker no nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In experiments vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered retained their normal level of activity.</seg>

		<seg id="12">The vaccines had to be given to maintain the Antikörperpegels so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells in antibody factories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As Professor Crystal said, could be a future vaccine for people, if he is sure to be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely that smokers would use him to stop.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They know that if they begin to smoke, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine is no more, and that helps them to give up the habit,&quot; he explained.</seg>

		<seg id="5">&quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said the 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the, and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that since its founding in 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organisation, the government.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 U.S. dollars to demand from passengers on their flight hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though, in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers are likely to keep the whole box.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new fee applies to hand luggage in the overhead baggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said it charged 25 if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid only at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said, the fee of $100 is introducing travelers to move in the payment.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We do not want to charge this amount,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second checked baggage fees.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers who tried to circumvent this, therefore, plugged into the cabin baggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O 'Malley said, the new fee, it is not really trying to make money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly expressed that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier, a bag for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O 'Malley said, the website of Frontier and check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only come into force in the summer, an exact date is not yet.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often grumbled about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines are happy to fall back on.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago, the first charges for hand luggage and later, Allegiant Air, a low-cost carriers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely followed the additional charges.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He estimated in a report in December 2011 that bring the hand baggage fee Spirit $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flown with spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate, when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The boarding process was one of the smoothly I have seen in my career in aviation,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical discussions at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;The plane was full,&quot; he said, &quot;and the boarding as lubricated.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier spirit is also the $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, would keep the whole box and will be free coffee.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Water is still free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In 2008, U.S. Airways had tried to demand for soft drinks, but seven months later, after passengers complained and was opposed to any other big company.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Frontiers step to charge for hand luggage, passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on its own website.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It provides all companies an incentive to get passengers to the direct purchase with them on an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Frontier has gone, however, is the most in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, the company began, when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday the miles have been cut to 25 percent of the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="37">A third-party booked a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers therefore only 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Passengers can also book exclusively to the direct purchase on the website of Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The revenue fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity fell almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report, which was released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.,.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic has tried to get under the sale of the company's finances of Frontier.</seg>

		<seg id="0">John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that the US spying was &quot;inappropriate gone too far.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission softening the defensive attitude of the United States in terms of their surveillance programs, saying that the espionage is inappropriate in certain cases, &quot;gone too far.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The foreign minister also admitted that he bore responsibility for the fact that we have switched on &quot;autopilot&quot; with Barack Obama, when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower, Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The leaked information is the U.S. government in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In a speech transmitted by video link on the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: &quot;there is no question, the President and I and others in the government of some of the things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to 9 / 11.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Then he became the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US spying have crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;In some cases, the inappropriate has gone too far.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The president is determined to create clarity, and therefore a thorough investigation so that no one must have the feeling that abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I can assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and have been saved many lives through its surveillance operations.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: &quot;We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up in the air.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is a radical extremism in the world, which is keen to kill people to blow up in the air and attacking governments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So what if we would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We have actually prevented attacks on buildings, plane crashes and the killing of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe, in order to dispel the doubts about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need for the anti-terror efforts continue to cooperate with the United States, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is concerned about their threats not to participate because of frustration over the surveillance by the National Security Agency to anti-terror organizations.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism remain on board,&quot; said Murphy, who is in the Senate for the first time as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European affairs, and, in an interview in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Moreover, I go to Europe, in order to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Other revelations quoted from documents provided by Snowden further that the NSA had monitored the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state leaders around the world.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that this was customary on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In all the uproar, Murphy said that his agency is preparing the journey of the Congress, which is due to take place this year, and hoped the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The names of the other MPs are to be published in the coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He said that the exact itinerary will be worked out.</seg>
		<seg id="24">While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is to improve the improvement of relations, he also said that there would be some &quot;serious words.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">He said that the European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs that they themselves for years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;We can change our surveillance programs and better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy,&quot; said Murphy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Meanwhile, stands for John Kerry over the weekend, a trip to the Middle East and to Poland, to deal with the resentment over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Distant worlds.</seg>
		<seg id="4">More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have already found.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Whether there is at least some of them, no one knows.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The selection is difficult: One is to look for gravitational waves?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life?</seg>
		<seg id="9">These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For its program &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance the research.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The budget for such missions &quot;l&quot; is about a billion euros.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At the beginning of September, met in Paris, the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">30 ideas were discussed, five of which are now in the final round.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Many bodies examine the proposals, according to the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated &quot;cosmic vision&quot; to find answers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?</seg>
		<seg id="19">The exact processes for the formation of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit stars - they are still in the proverbial dark.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise?</seg>
		<seg id="22">In order to investigate this issue will start in 2017, the space telescope &quot;,&quot; with the 500 already known planetary systems in our neighbourhood.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The possibilities are limited, however, is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With larger instruments astronomers erdähnliche planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: Gases, which are seen as an indicator for biological activity.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How does the solar system?</seg>
		<seg id="26">Ultimately, this question is to say what conditions for the emergence of life.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from the system.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In our solar system, these processes can.</seg>
		<seg id="29">With the &quot;solar Orbiter&quot; Esa already has a mission of the M-class (the budget is around half a billion euros) for this question.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The probe will start in 2017 and observe surface and activity of the sun.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.</seg>
		<seg id="32">You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The Esa sees the first of the three L-missions of the &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; programme.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The probe &quot;juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.</seg>

		<seg id="36">What are the basic physical laws of the universe?</seg>
		<seg id="37">The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the known laws of nature are still valid.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Maybe there are deviations, the physicists could point the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature.</seg>
		<seg id="39">How the universe was created and what is it?</seg>
		<seg id="40">13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In addition to the usual from the stars, planets and life as we are, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, which is the expansion of the.</seg>
		<seg id="42">So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws of physics in the first of the Big Bang 'split second were valid, is dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="43">&quot;Euclid&quot; the Esa has already been approved by a mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, and thus allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Who could make the race</seg>
		<seg id="46">Of the 30 proposals will remain at the end of the selection process only two.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The best chances of approval as a mission, according to many experts &quot;E-Lisa,&quot; a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="49">They were not detected.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Elisa could create the, the scientists hope behind the project.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The mission provides two or three probes existing detector, which is stationed in space.</seg>
		<seg id="52">He could, in contrast to plants on Earth's gravitational waves, which are in the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origins of the cosmos.</seg>
		<seg id="53">Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: A large X-ray telescope called &quot;Athena,&quot; which, among other things, is to explore black holes, &quot;icy planets,&quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism,&quot; a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder&quot; to detect and investigate the erdähnliche planet.</seg>

		<seg id="6">At the drug gangs assured Duffy: &quot;If you continue to build such tunnels and trying to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="2">After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation, Republicans cast the president in the last few days, he had misled the American public.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yesterday, Obama watered down its original promise.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, can keep them,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who have received such messages to look for a new insurance on the open market.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Most citizens could get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than received.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;You get a better offer,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The government called it a little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance would have to look for another tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Parents can choose children &quot;&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Under the new law, parents must be no more sex for such children, but &quot;vague&quot; or &quot;not&quot; on the birth certificate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against the people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A intersexuelle person, according to BBC years later said: &quot;I am neither man nor woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I remain a patchwork quilt, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year, either as a boy or a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They belong to the, a group that fall under the diagnosis &quot;sexual differentiation disorder&quot; (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson was perhaps more.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States, you should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide - if any - for an operation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law &quot;blade for a good cause.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Sexual interaction children represent an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical procedure, but for most children are not,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It could be a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the developing identity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The scientific data about how a child develops at all his gender identity, are not very accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one knows why it happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are transsexual and transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These properties were in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structures and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced intersexuelle and transgender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults on official documents, male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; reported.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) as the world's first &quot;gender-free&quot; person, after a court had granted the maintenance of a &quot;unspecified&quot; gender status.</seg>
		<seg id="24">German identity cards besides M and W, in a third allocation, in addition to the future, X for sexually, the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the &quot;gender theory&quot; should be removed from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The US Catholic Online website has also spoken out against the German law, saying: &quot;If the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">The mother of a newborn from Maryland told baby zone, it would be better if babies will be assigned to a sex at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,&quot; she said of the parents' website.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and security.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children who were born with both male and female parts, called Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god who had both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ten years ago, the medicine regarded sex as something that you can wipe out and then rebuild.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But in the meantime, questioned the ethical foundations of an operation now is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child at the turn of the sex of their allocation.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the middle of the 20th century, we called this a&quot; psychiatric emergency, &quot;said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If such a child was born, then called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized as to whether a person is male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one under the title &quot;John / Joan&quot; case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to neuter the child and to remove his testicles and keep him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but he did not,&quot; says Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">With 38 but he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practice this model.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of this sex operations to the public, who are &quot;not happy with the result.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life &quot;as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So external body and testicles were removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was brought up as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">At the age of 12, he received female hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I am not a girl,&quot; he said on ABCNews.com</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But because he was depressed and knew that something was amiss, he asked for his medical records.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he found was shocking.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilised am birth - and no one has ever told me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a DSD, through his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After he had told the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The operation, he has become infertile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for sexual people are perceived as normal.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;could&quot; encourage stamping and.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to&quot;, &quot;she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We fear that favours intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we still do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because &quot;it allows adult recognition as a third sex.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law is about the allocation at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This is not a fight, which should be small children at this time.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radio login from Pitt, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law &quot;authorize&quot; both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because of the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Today, Katie 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Although she is infertile, but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make hasty decisions,&quot; said Baratz.</seg>
		<seg id="76">It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them more time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this way, everything is in order, the child and loves it.</seg>
		<seg id="78">It was a wonderful baby and enjoys the parental happiness.</seg>
		<seg id="79">And we must not rush to make an operation that will not.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that the parents, because they believe that they would not do the right thing,&quot; she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Ultimately, the child decides on the sex, which is more suited to him - and it is wonderful.</seg>
		<seg id="82">This will be able to make the decision themselves.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in the car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe the solution to be found in a small black box, the space in the dashboard of each car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, which record and report the information to the authorities, the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the federal states to review the outdated system of financing American roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarian have allied themselves with environmental groups and that the government of the small boxes to record mileage - and, possibly, where they were driven and then use the information for the calculation of modest tax.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Tea Party is appalled.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of data protection concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states wait no longer.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are looking at how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, in which drivers pay per mile driven.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of drivers have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS tracking, already tested.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This really is a must for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There is nothing that we will only use may be,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of government, which is planning a record of driven miles in all California motorists in the federal state in 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The way we pay these taxes, will change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump is broke.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But in America is no longer as much fuel as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars use less gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians do not dare to high fuel prices, raising the tax by a penny.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gas tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The federal government has recently 500 cars with black boxes, which are tested a mileage-based payment system.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;This is the most sensible alternative, in the long term,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Bureaucrats call it as a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions to be reduced.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies that the ambitious, statutory objectives of the federal state on climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are taken with the idea to drivers pay zurückgelegter route.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People pay directly for what they get.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had urged in a report to Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of mileage-based billing.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The US Senate last year approved a $90 million expensive pilot project, which includes 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the thrust and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, the people who in everyday life, often many miles on the way to work or in the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several states and cities move on their own in this direction.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most active is Oregon, which is currently enlists 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal government.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="36">New York City also is considering.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois is testing it in a limited way with trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I- 95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently studying how to introduce the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue its every move.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and product management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The people did not want it.</seg>
		<seg id="43">As the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in mature monitoring devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Thus, Khan, the public would be some.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The company is not originally started to help states in the taxation of drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Rather, it was their goal to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers based on the basis of miles.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices are also tested for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which are regularly uploaded via modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes have been made.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with to give drivers a number of choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">You can opt for a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they can choose any device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all the inhabitants of the federal state driven miles.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by the devices with more features than with little.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which is also pay parking fees, insurance must be paid only for driving distances and speed data are collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists would be the added value of the benefits of the system, motivated to participate,&quot; says a planning document of the city.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some traffic planners, however, are wondering whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge distraction.</seg>
		<seg id="61">The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing the fuel tax.</seg>
		<seg id="62">An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, will be imposed, so that they also pay a fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no need for an operation, if an aspirin is enough,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists are concerned about their privacy and many other things.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Thousands of people gathered in the centre Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration of peace.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want peace, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Out of fear for the future of the country, their business attire for a T-shirt with the inscription &quot;We want security&quot; in Portuguese and joined the crowd on the Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement, more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in a bid to destabilize the country's independent government.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts consider it unlikely that zurueckfalle the country back into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could in the next few years investments of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling FRELIMO Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">RENAMO claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes, it could have on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos attacked.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The attacks on the former rebels escalated, when government troops attacked bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government is Renamo the blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He told AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as &quot;losers&quot; who &quot;wants to use all its remaining forces to prove that the government can impose its decisions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Both FRELIMO and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was the 1992 peace agreement in.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the FT, he said that he had meant that FRELIMO no longer respect the agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who heads collide,&quot; says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">RENAMO, which is pressing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the local elections in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement, concessions and financial incentives from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Renamos electoral success since 1992, while a new party, headed by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency,&quot; said.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear what capacity Renamo, but it has made disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south routes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira, but the port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio interrupted a month for the use of the railways, after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability has increased the frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people already worried about the corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave of abduction.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.</seg>

		<seg id="7">In &quot;double Down&quot; is said, Daley had stood at the forefront of efforts to Biden, despite their &quot;close, personal relationship&quot; before eventually decided against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy &quot;would not significantly improve the chances of Obama's.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="9">&quot;I made a whole series of things that you should consider, and that was one of them,&quot; Daley told the magazine.</seg>
		<seg id="10">We must remember that the President had terrible poll numbers, so we thought: &quot;For God's sake, what do we do?&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">Verzweiflungs cry of an Obama voter</seg>
		<seg id="1">I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blocking tactics by Republicans</seg>
		<seg id="3">The blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes</seg>
		<seg id="4">Obama's memoir about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I read a terribly sad book.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a book that I thought it would be sad during the second year medical student cheering up and give me hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;the Audacity to Win&quot; (courage to win) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In the evening, I am finished with my patients transcripts and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election was a landslide victory and the to lead the historical significance of this hour.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers that they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Obama into office in 2008, he had approval voting values of 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if it is from a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years since I made my voice for the first time, something has changed.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But there is simply nothing that I could have imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I also believe that the partisan blockade tactics have too many efforts, with whom our nation should be brought forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after countless times, I have defended the Obama administration to colleagues and friends, I am with my point at the end.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I have reached a point of political desperation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Republican obstructionism cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers should be punished, the government misconduct.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki was an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media are the &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And the most recent cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know if that is what I should have expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If I have to understand that the government could contradict the previous political campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Apparently, the is not a predictable course Abgeordnetenamt, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And that bothers me the most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I was re-elected in 2012, Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not its direction and positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes that we had heard for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But with the drop in approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week to return to 2008 through this book.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me the desire for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama has had a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In a meeting with election officials after the decision, he told his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want us to find our magic,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We need to remember who we are.</seg>
		<seg id="42">There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree with you more.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>
