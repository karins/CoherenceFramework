		<seg id="2">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or with your mobile device from</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 &quot;CNN Heroes of 2013.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to elect him to the &quot;CNN Hero of the Year&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The winner gets $250000 to continue its exceptional work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">21 years saw Georges Bwelle of his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals, which did not have the resources to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">James Bwelle in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First, he had a broken arm, but it was an inflammation, which has broadened his brain, causing a hematomas, that should affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There was no neuro-surgeons in Cameroon,&quot; Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have him released from Cameroon, if we had had the money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not easy,&quot; said Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can run at five o 'clock in the morning to leave the house and the hospital to be the first one, and it is not first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are very many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Indeed, some people die because they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation has changed little since Bwelles father died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In contrast, the ratio is in the United States to a doctor for 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But even if there was a doctor for them, could not afford the most Cameroonians the visit.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">His father, and so many of his country to see people suffer in mature Bwelle decided to do something about it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers carried out last year, 700 free operations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He himself was a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, he squeezed and up to 30 people in minibuses and into medical equipment on the roof on unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Not everything is proceeding smoothly.</seg>
		<seg id="32">More than once they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation has to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle – with its broad smile and his boundless energy – in the joyful celebration.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Each trip we treat 500 people,&quot; Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village – and on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these weekend clinics offering medical care in a number of areas.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates, a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening, the team simple operations with local anaesthetic.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations are usually in a school, the City Hall or an apartment; after the procedure on patients, and in the recreation area in order to make room for the next.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment supplied by the generator of the group and Bwelle and volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is an arduous tasks, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They drum all night, so that we can stay awake and continue our work,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has carried out last year, 700 free operations and knows that it is an enormous difference to the people with their work, which helps them.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man explained that the free operation of strips that he had received enabled him to return to work.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;The changes the future of my family,&quot; the man said.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital works Bwelle night in private clinics in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="51">With this second job pays 60% of his charitable work, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I really do not know when he is asleep,&quot; says Katie O 'Malley, who for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He is always either in hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization, so he can go to these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">Support for medical and nursing students such as O 'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never get at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or instruments for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; explains O 'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The students pay for their trip to Cameroon normally themselves and often donated medical equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is undoubtedly a hero,&quot; says O 'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bwelle is almost no permanent workload.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Others to give to a happier life, and thus to fulfill a promise he made to his father, he has a great deal of pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I am doing this work,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I am thinking of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I do it to make people laugh and to relieve the pain.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will for the first time on 22 February appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Cardinals are the most senior cleric in the Catholic church after the Pope and they can also choose a Pope Francis, so that it will appoint the first group of men who ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Currently, there are 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years, no longer take part in the papal election – which is a group of 120 cardinals eligible &quot;choice&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In a statement, said the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony will be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as a consistory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,&quot; said Lombardi.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, said that the cardinals will probably be dropped until February.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He explained that a pope usually take so many cardinals as necessary so that the Cardinals 1.44 120 again, and so many cardinals over 80, as he likes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The consistory next year is important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Currently, there is some overhang on the part of Europe and, in particular, Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world, in order to restore the balance,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Forty percent of Catholics live in Latin America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Cardinals will also be the first since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have to find ways to reform the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Francis has selected eight cardinals to help him,&quot; said Valero.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He explained that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that the Cardinals Francis ask for advice.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But so far we have not been in this situation, it is all brand new.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said that typically the bishops from great places to cardinals, Francis sponges &quot;full of surprises, so we do not know whom he appoints.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="2">To this end, we have the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders commissioned and asked them what they think of Britain, the economy and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov interviewed more than 1000 forces command from the economy, the British company sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have found that the vast majority of businesses now exports outside Europe and focused on countries stagnate, modernize and grow, while the countries in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want to be favored by the government side, new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than with the long and arduous process of reforming the EU institutions are obscure.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Asked for their opinion on certain regulatory issues, from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of the economic leaders is of the opinion that control over these key skills should be brought back to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was a general dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to the company in the meantime, the cost of the Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits to be part of Europe's trade zone, even 40% of large companies agreed to the traditionally friendly in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of economic leaders that a clear majority wants from Britain a course in the direction of change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU, which is based on trade, not on policy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This realization that is used in companies of all sizes and leading companies, shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot;meaningful change&quot; brings a return to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain at 16 percent, to a change of opinion in favour of the EU in a popular vote.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Prime Minister should have no doubt that this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK's conditions for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that the company from a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A better deal for the British economy is possible and necessary increasingly after the eurozone now toward closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our poll shows, which means for companies with a greater emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.</seg>

		<seg id="16">And it is economical, too: the older lights consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.</seg>
		<seg id="17">There are three light per direction plants.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Arnold said the technology of the new plant: this is equipped with two radar sensors.</seg>

		<seg id="3">According to German media that BAT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, was again in September that the US has no chance of foreign espionage, &quot;the company secrets of foreign companies in order to steal American companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profits.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden, the former employees that the whistle-blower, started with the publication of his cornucopia of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and company bosses no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports that the US National Security Agency has spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and American data cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, the companies have paranoia about government surveillance to a new peak.</seg>

		<seg id="8">If the most powerful person in Europe, then certainly company lines, potential targets.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden has made transparent intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I believe that it is possible that this data will be used for mutual benefit.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; says Oliver Green, president of the BITMi, small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="12">German companies believe that the US is now a risk that is almost as big as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, a survey published in July by the consultancy firm EY.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence that the US has the company secrets of foreign companies to own companies.</seg>

		<seg id="20">Everything in Germany is subsidised by the coal on cars to agriculture.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Everything, except for the IT industry.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nevertheless, reach and technical sophistication of the Snowden revelations uncovered U.S. spy agencies have shocked, the greatest risk of espionage in China.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The cloud computing is a big change, because European business leaders are now more aware of that data stored in the US are subject to the jurisdiction and therefore potentially are at risk.</seg>

		<seg id="26">Many German company manager believes that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">That economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This has always been the case.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;It was for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion,&quot; said Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.</seg>

		<seg id="34">The German command BAT advises to use simple prepaid cell phones when they travel abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The prepaid phones are thrown away.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leader in the niche.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, the staff and financial resources to protect business secrets effectively against unauthorized access,&quot; the BAT warns in a report.</seg>

		<seg id="14">He ran on sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny that he has done a fantastic job.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens, he cares.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As it is, it won't be long until it is on the &quot;horse of the Year&quot; show – and I am sure he will do well.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A spokesman for the annual horse said: &quot;Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take &quot;immediate action&quot; to avert a crisis that was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The funding for a period of four years, it was decided after government consultations with the Tasman independent MPs Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government has an emergency rescue package that we believe that the unique challenges faced by the federal government,&quot; said Plibersek today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The 325-million-dollar package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey Star, residues are to be eliminated.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In addition, there is money for clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, the specialist training services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system of electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Profits at Bombardier to decrease in numbers and supply contracts</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc. reported a 15% drop in net profits on Thursday after he was declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector under pressure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bombardier with headquarters in Montreal published any flight test data for its new aircraft of the CSeries and gave no new information on whether the aircraft under the ambitious timetable next September in commercial use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the Jungfernflug test aircraft followed one and a half months, so far, only three more starts, which begs the question of whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results were back behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent on the stock exchange in Toronto.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating of &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;sector perform&quot; in view of the fact that the shares in the next one to two quarters has a limited course.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Although weaker delivery figures were largely expected to aircraft, but the margins in the development of trans-sports we are clearly disappointed,&quot; said Doerksen in a customer.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that new Bombardier orders for the CSeries, if the test program is proceeding on the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that the market is more skeptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the aircraft series of CSeries can catapult the company into the market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test aircraft was introduced in March, the public and flew for the first time after months of delays in September.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But so far are binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers wait for the results of the test flights and want to see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new Düsenverkehrsflugzeugs is correct.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Board Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The company's management assured on Thursday with analysts and the media, the program is in the schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test is no longer on the ground than we expected,&quot; Beaudoin said during a telephone conference and added that during the lifetime of the aircraft were ground tests and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Each manufacturer is planning differently.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, what we have done.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This is happening throughout the flight programme.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test planes will probably start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was said by company.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, analysts remain sceptical as to whether 12 months after the Jungfernflug the first customer is an aircraft of the CSeries.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said it checked the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and will update this in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;The slow progress of the test flight, even if they are obviously Bombardier internal planning, reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015,&quot; Doerksen said.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter coincided with the end on 30 September, Bombardier net profits to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The adjusted earnings per share unchanged is 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Sales slipped slightly and fell from 4.2% to 4.1 billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenues of 4.56 billion dollars, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturers, he had 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Net orders fell from 83 aircraft on 26.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The contract was the aerospace division was 32.9 billion on September 30 dollars and was unchanged compared to 31 December.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In the field of aerospace, the results were within the framework of our targets, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing,&quot; said Beaudoin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the turnover has increased in this area by nearly 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The contract was in the transport sector on September 30, $32.6 billion and was slightly increased to 31 December.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement of problems with some large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">According to the company's leadership, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier shares at 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Australian airline passengers must continue to tablets and smartphones off on takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax the rules for such devices.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their targets, so that passengers on their devices during critical phases of flight read e-books, videos, or play, if they are in the &quot;flight mode.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">During most of the flight, passengers already allowed, but there are many people angry that they can't read at the launch and landing their e-books.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Australian companies are watching the decision to implement the US airlines oodles of work to do, however, had no immediate plans to change their rules.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The air traffic control authority CASA also declared that they will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;CASA currently has no specific rules on use of electronic devices on the plane,&quot; has been forthcoming on that.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain security at any time and passengers the safety instructions given by the cabin crew must follow.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Virgin has already led to the CASA talks on an extension of use of Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said it was open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.</seg>

		<seg id="11">&quot;Our current guidelines, electronic equipment at the launch and landing, may not be used, and we currently have no plans to change that,&quot; the company said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, we are always interested in developments in rules that benefit passengers, and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The decision on US companies vary depending on the age of the fleet.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and manuals, training materials, hand luggage-change programs and customer training.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers using portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at every level,&quot; the FAA announced.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which leaves the tail of a dog with his mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Previous research had shown that happy dog with a tail wag more to the right (from the perspective of the dog), while it was the left-hand side in nervous dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other dogs can these subtle differences and respond to it.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist in the University of Trento, said: &quot;in humans is well known that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to stimuli, positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here, we have tried to look at this in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right brain hemisphere is responsible for the movement of the left side, and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs on the lateral tail leaves react to their fellows, the researchers monitored the animals, while other dogs, these films.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed the behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">We will probably soon understand why the tail in two moves in the opposite direction</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;we have shown the dogs films with dogs, either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distract other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail, more to the left or right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">If the animals looked like a dog's tail otherwise free expression, moved to the right (has) seen from the perspective of their dog, they remained completely relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But it was the tail slope to the left (again, from the perspective of dog wag), their increased heart rate and they saw restless.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Professor Vallortigara communicate the dogs not deliberately by these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Rather, he is convinced that the dog had learned from experience that movements they should worry or not.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He said: &quot;if you have several encounters with other dogs and a swish with the tail in one direction is linked with friendly behaviour and the right side, rather a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of this experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could lead to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and visiting fellow at the Faculty of animal medicine at the University of Bristol said that this was not the first study looked at both left and right is important for dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln that dogs turn the head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada: &quot;dogs tend to go to a robot dog, if his ' tail wag ' on the left and the right not to be restless – just the opposite, as in the Italian study.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to his testimony, the differences may stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies, the animals in the movies or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;Although there is considerable evidence of many different types of mammals that both halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details are still to be determined, and dogs are no exception,&quot; says Bradshaw.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Since her behaviour but simply put, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail, sometimes in one, sometimes moves in the opposite direction.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Actually, Waltraud Ries lives.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart, with a lot of green, an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the city, there are only a few minutes by public transport.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;I hope they are not afraid of spiders?&quot; Asks Waltraud Ries, pointing at the door of a big spider.</seg>
		<seg id="5">I am looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many steps to the house and no longer in the apartment, she explains.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Moreover, since a meniscus tears operation, the Mittfünfzigerin experienced what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Recently published a book of her on ' Lucky live in old age - Which living form is the best for me? '.</seg>
		<seg id="10">' Our apartment is the best example of what is not in old age, ' she says.</seg>
		<seg id="11">When she moved more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Now in his mid-fifties Waltraud Ries feel that way.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the issue of ' living in old age.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Most of it, as long as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They are old, the other ', says chuckle.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Only if the suffering is great pressure, you are thinking.</seg>
		<seg id="17">' Then it may be too late, &quot; Ries.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In her book, the interior designer 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.</seg>
		<seg id="19">' What living form but one chooses, is an individual decision, &quot; she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The leading solution, it is not for the ages.</seg>

		<seg id="22">And: ' Without lonely good knowledge of the country's language in the Dolce Vita ' specialist book author to consider relocation.</seg>

		<seg id="25">&quot; For me it would be a residential community, but nothing, ' she says with a wink.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Certainly not as a student WG with a shared bathroom and kitchen.</seg>
		<seg id="27">' In the age you just need his withdrawal rooms ' Ries.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A senior living community can still work, the author does not want to exclude.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It must then work differently than in the classical student WG.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And sometimes you want to simply his rest, she believes.</seg>
		<seg id="31">With this view, it is not, at least in the capital alone.</seg>
		<seg id="32">' The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it is in their own home, is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the country's capital.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The department advises people around ' ageing '.</seg>
		<seg id="34">That is why older people would often just inconvenience and restrictions, only to be able to remain in that environment, that is the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There are many ways to make the house or apartment, barrier-free.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Ries recommends all dealing with the age just remodeling their house or apartment, once thoroughly, and not just the best craftsmen.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Today, there is also the age just reconstruction specialists.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Even in the apartment for rent is one or the other, and if it is only the Toilettensitzerhöhung, clarifies the interior designer.</seg>
		<seg id="39">But it is not always the existing apartment age and thus accessible, even if it is so beautiful.</seg>
		<seg id="40">This experience has had to make Waltraud Ries.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Although we could install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the road paved with stairs to the street would be a far greater obstacle.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It will continue until it has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Before the move dread it more than before the spider on her front door.</seg>

		<seg id="3">He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
		<seg id="4">A well-known criminal defense lawyers, a drug baron warned of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Basha Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The lawyer of Kriminalisten as &quot;first class&quot; lauded, nicknamed &quot;bash&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011, after the police had been monitoring Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Officials watched as Scarborough (32), three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, miners, while the lawyer chamber with colleagues during a meal.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All four suspects were monitored by the police as part of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West York.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They, together with 32 other people were arrested after the police in a series of raids of heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200000 in cash ensured.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction can be known.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today, Ditta, who works for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at Liverpool Crown Court after three weeks of two counts of obstruction of justice, found guilty and sentenced.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He admitted the cocaine possession in a previous survey.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The lawyer was convicted after the police in their investigations of Scarborough found that this was in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two officials of the investigation followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas house and drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove in the dustbin of the lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, called Scarborough regularly Ditta, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer returned home, the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In court, it became known that Ditta was a &quot;regular&quot; consumers of cocaine, after tests of class A drugs were discovered in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta was later arrested, but denied that cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because this was his client, and claimed that their discussion 'ed &quot;lawyer secret.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and he was taken from a hair sample.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The police interrogation, he admitted, he both under his home address and an office space and clients would call home because of legal issues.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In court, it became known that he has important players in the drug trade, some of whom he previously had called for significant arrests and had informed about what the investigators knew about it.</seg>
		<seg id="24">State lawyer Anne Whyte said: &quot;a criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else, not breaking the law.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as defence lawyers, because he has too much with certain clients.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relationship is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But that went far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.</seg>
		<seg id="29">He was the police investigation as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr Ditta brought to his profession in disrepute.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He was certain clients, in particular, Scarborough, and he allowed his independence has been compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing and claimed: &quot;if I were a corrupt lawyer, what am I, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait for 15 hours, but do it immediately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after the hearing, said superintendent Lee Halstead by police in Lancashire: &quot;Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender a criminal when he began to buy drugs from organised criminals.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">His cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and trust and confidence in the public eye.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Ditta has betrayed that trust and trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring the criminals to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This case should serve as a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and bring you to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison, after the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade was found guilty.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Thirty-five more involved in the drugs ' people were sentenced to total fines of 153 years for drug offences.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On his website published Ditta an area with questions and answers, in which he, his dream job, as a lawyer to represent clients in the cell death in America, his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Schiltach must take 220000 euros.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Deutsche Bahn wants to improve in the coming year, the Kinzigtal-rail route.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Especially to enhance safety at level crossings are regularly - it is far to collisions of trains with other vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The communities into, they need to be involved with one third of the cost, the rest are divided and Federal.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Schiltach city architect Roland Grießhaber explained the specifics of Bahübergangs &quot;Hirschen.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">The city plans to build the railway tracks a bulge in the tunnel mouth west.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There could also carry bigger cars, for example, the logs, with oncoming traffic, without blocking the tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Grießhaber proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall so that the city could expand the subsequent street in due time, in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This has been controversial in the council, as some councils, the need for roads spread in doubt: Thomas tilt, saying the mood of the critics: &quot;we have to because so few vehicles so much money?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mayor Thomas Haas said: the railroad crossing Hirschen will regularly for Langholztransporte.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Even wood from the Kuhbach &quot; partly transported via this route, because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route to the Häberlesbrücke there, because they could not turn on the main street.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In addition, the route serves as Umleitungfür those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main street is locked, Haas argued.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Since it was that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel and should be rehabilitated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing &quot; Hirschen for a longer period of time an important traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The councils agreed to investigate the cost to the idea of broadening the street.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Regardless of the reorganization was approved by a majority of the railway crossing, with the proviso that the necessary retaining wall will be built so that the city of the subsequent direction &quot;Bahnhofstraße&quot; if necessary, for encounters traffic increase to around 5.5 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The reconstruction of the railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the &quot;Geroltzhäuser path to increase substantially.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">The administration had Breinlinger examine the reconstruction plans of the railway from the engineering firm, because they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser route was still possible.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The investigation concluded that the inclination of the road conditions that could lead to longer picked vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Responsibility for this, in turn, the city as a Straßenbaulastträgerin.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The renovation could therefore liability disputes.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Since both the wood collection and were left in the current state of development, we should not support the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a good view of the transition of the vehicle is significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because right in the mid-point, to which a connection.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even trains from the main railway station should be slowed down at this point that no threatening collision.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The majority of the reconstruction of this railway crossing refused to consent, as the city Schiltach suffer should the problem with bulky vehicles &quot;,&quot; the councils, as the train to the retreat from the responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As the panel considers the modifications to the level crossings &quot;Heubach&quot; and &quot;Kuhbach&quot;, which has already been crossing agreements have been reached by train.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of the destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable, which is aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can produce more new chemical weapons.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Damascus, however, has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.</seg>
		<seg id="8">According to estimates there are about 1000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.</seg>

		<seg id="18">The monitoring office said that there was on Thursday losses on both sides, but gave no details.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: grow up faster</seg>
		<seg id="1">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty as their white age, as studies show.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes mean not directly puberty</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A mother should be worried if her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics paediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, said of the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new standard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents – normally, this is not a sign that now quickly puberty,&quot; explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and Achselhaare and body odor, with girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age at 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;If the development of breasts, it will still take at least two to three years to Menarche&quot; said Kaplowitz, author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: the essential guide to deal with this problem frequently occurring.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test, which is progressing puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is controversial, as indeed is the beginning of puberty, but it is &quot;precocious&quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process is slowed down or stalled – something that can monitor a pediatrician.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Tests by a Endikronologen displayed so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded for faster progress.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are methods of treatment to delay an early menstruation and another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and small body grew in adults.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy at the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psycho-social aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: &quot;the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavior problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age mates.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their young daughters of the period.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter with her ten days.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even if there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She was scared and excited by the school's home because it was the first in her circle of friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or the cause of sexual messages in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Young are similar to girls in puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He supported the implementation of a study on girls in 2001 at the age of six to nine years, a link between body fat and entering puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other studies support that conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country tend to be African-American and Hispanic girls puberty rather than their white age.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are different reasons for this.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, economic conditions on the climate to the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another mystery: although the boys face and Schambehaarung earlier is growing, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors on the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is even in babies and young children.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to take advice from their doctor, how they should talk to their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;This may mean that it must be sooner than expected,&quot; advised Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If we remain quiet, the child responded well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls, early bloom, need the insurance, the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens sooner than expected.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 accusations against child carers Jonathan Lord of Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But the opening statement before the Commission had declared the YMCA, you had to do with never an incident of child sexual abuse &quot;in the organization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Business leader Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA employee was charged with offences of child pornography, and another in which a PE teachers of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was in 1991 because of the abuse he follow children.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer, nowadays the Commission that he had known of the first case, the second was not known.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He acknowledged that the YMCA opening statement to the Commission was also vague on the assertion that &quot;there was external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Evidence before the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he has received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Educational Department) in August of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the line &quot;I failed to down&quot; in the recruitment of Lord and not ensured that staff had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Lord had been convicted of sexual offences in twelve boys during his two years of working for the YMCA at the beginning of the year.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Hare but denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that employees have prevented Lords to report violations in relation to the safety of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The employees said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she worked as a babysitter, they sit on his lap, said that he liked it, and children playing with his mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord and had asked for a training on child protection, because it was concerned about his behavior, said that the Kinderdienstleiterin Jacqui Barnat, the Lords in the YMCA Caringbah the chief was very intimidating, &quot;and most of the time was very remote.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The business leader said that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to their superiors.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Instead, he said, but their friendship with Lord their judgment impaired assets, which is why they have not reported it.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hare said that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organisation from the Jonathan Lord incident &quot;, not &quot; affects reporting &quot; by staff, and the board voted for him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Hare said the decision to push the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations, was the director of children's services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said that the contamination of the evidence should be prevented, but it was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The YMCA NSW was busy at the time, as Jonathan Lord between 2009 and 2011, there was no safe for children, said Professor Stephen Small Bone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, of the Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He explained that it had &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, review, training, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The hearing was postponed until 20 December.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots the choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">A new day, a new horror story to independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary in order to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a secure border with barbed wire along the Hadrianswalls.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In fact, in the Strathclyde template to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was – according to expectations, no role in the headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">No one has mentioned that the EU member states often bent strict rules when it is convenient for them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As Scotland currently does not belong to the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels, only a small concession in exchange for what we really want the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So not really a story.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And one that is already happened in the years that it already looks like a fossil, the first time I have heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; duck at least 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is a interes interesting lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that dances to the tune of Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why the yoke of London against the trade from Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, adopted after the war is faltering.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Throughout the EU parties are gaining ground, the EU or the euro as a common currency to throw overboard.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany, founded this year – nearly five million votes in the general election in September to acquire and distribute effectively the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The current economic crisis is a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the straitjacket, forced into the national economy by adhering to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments create excessive budget deficits – that was the case in Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Instead, the Eurosystem has its members be pinned down on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters, and the German politicians would like.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency is southern Europe with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of the imposed by Brussels ' green ' energy policies – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays – the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grange mouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All Lohnfestschreibungen the world protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American shale gas.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result of a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader for the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that Germany could be contained and Paris on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">However, Berlin, Paris does not need more than a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, the ailing French economy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU anti-National Front has just won a key by-election and the ruling Socialists in third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right wing would automatically mean benefits for the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen, with their newly gained popularity among the white French working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She would like to use the European elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-EU currency bloc in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and it is very possible – could dominate for the first time such a block of the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come together to the abolition of the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it is something like the &quot;Europe&quot; (sovereign) nations favored General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and a few of its satellite economies, perhaps, to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that Great Britain distanced himself from the project, hoping to curry favour with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="39">But Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Where is Scotland in all this?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can decide to be a region (ultimately) small-England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels to say what they can hinstecken where.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland could very well in a looser Europe, if we keep our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The cooperation with other countries, similar thinking is not a federal Europe of the Nations easier.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should keep Norway and our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP government in Scotland – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and won) made cuts to the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide in favour of independence, only to be imposed from Berlin and Brussels austerity.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no phone calls)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Passengers can now hear from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading, games, music and use the prestige of films, but not with the mobile phone, the new guidelines, which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly they would be implemented, would depend on the airline, said FAA employees Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The airlines, the FAA must prove that aircraft comply with the new guidelines, and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the arrangements for the storage of the devices, according to the new rules.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said that she had already received some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA announced in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers must switch smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They should start again when the plane reached an altitude of three kilometers, and the captain gives the green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the entrance to the landing, the passengers must switch them back and they must not start again, before the plane landed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disruptions could allow passengers to use the devices at launch, landing on the tarmac, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most of the new transport aircraft and other pilots with the use of Wi-Fi in altitudes, should meet the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;If the new system is implemented, and we are working closely with the airline, both sides will benefit from it,&quot; said Glading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We are tired to be honest, we feel like watchdogs on this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nevertheless, continued banned Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres, the agency explained.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers are urged to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So there is still no &quot;words With Friends,&quot; the scrabble like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave public an American Airlines jet because he refused to shut down the device, while the plane was parked on the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed away, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain banned.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The regulatory authority for telephone conversations at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA lifts may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the traffic safety agency National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert for national traffic issues at CBS News, mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air disrupt transmission towers,&quot; said Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An advisory committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this matter, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA to relax restrictions on the use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCain kill from Missouri are of the opinion that there is no valid security reasons for the ban.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In some studies, up to one-third of the passengers, the closure of the device or ignored.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA began in 1966, restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of malfunctions of navigation and communications equipment were of passengers bears FM radios, the latest technology trend.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they have no electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines offer passengers for several years, Wi-Fi, if the altitude is reached.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less susceptible to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be eligible for the increased use of electronic devices, according to the new directives, Huerta said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices, in general, much less radio radiation than previous generations.</seg>
		<seg id="36">E-reader example, only minimal radiation, if you enjoy.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But when downloading or sending data, the transmission of values.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The advocates of an easing of restrictions on the devices use by passengers is Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, an employee of passenger aircraft Kindle e-reader and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but could not.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of the use of equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers Association passenger said he was of the opinion that the disruption by the device is real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other committee members said that there are only scattered reports of pilots who spoke to aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The committee recommended that the FAA to allow pilots in landing instruments under poor visibility conditions of the closure of the equipment by the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a sensible adjustment for travelers today would be extensively with technology.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that it is not a pleasant passenger experience is contrary to safety,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders</seg>
		<seg id="1">Between leading aircraft manufacturers, it is a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute revolves around the seat width, passengers on long flights in economy class is not always the most airlines, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the US archrival Boeing says that this should be decided by the airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft are competing to sell even more versions of its twin-engine long-range aircraft, and at the event from 17 to 21 November expect record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As the rear of the aircraft, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats, is crucial to the specified economic results, which is to deliver the new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; design.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing claims its modernized &quot;777X&quot; take 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and ten per line.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 carrying 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, there are nine per line.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Share aircraft giants often blows over technical details through advertisements in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now Airbus appealed before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Recently, the company has an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and donors showed a picture, in which three people squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: &quot;would you accept that?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing long-haul flights in seats that are more than regional turbo-prop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In light of changed eating habits are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, has increased the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years by 10%, the data from the US Department of Health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Taillenumfang male average American is in the 21 century, according to US health statistics 100.8 cm.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus says that his rival is a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly christened &quot;jet Set&quot; was narrow.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It was, Airbus, conducted research that showed that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat raises the sleep quality by 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing has disputed the figures from Airbus to the seat and says it is not to decide at the discretion of the manufacturer, as airlines make the balance between air fares and furnishings.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The company also said, according to research the experience in the aircraft from more than the seat width.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It really boils down to give airlines flexibility, so that they can do what they think they need to be successful,&quot; explains the Flugkabinenexperte Kent Craven of Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want us to dictate to them, which makes them profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, there is more freedom of elbows, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a substantial impact on the export performance of the US or Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficient per seat than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Boeing's statements on the results partly depend on the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared with the original design of the nine seats in the 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on his plane to make it more competitive for our products,&quot; says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777 indicated that many passengers opted for closer alignment, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Eighteen inches wide seat would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from an economic face from the Airbus is controlled by the threat of the 777,&quot; says Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin furnishing, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The world travelers jet sellers even tape measure, the establishment of gherkins in the competition.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Even if they offer comfort to all manufacturers also jets with highly condensed form for low-cost airlines and regional flights.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers a A350 with zehnsitzigen ranks, but has not yet been sold, according to its own statement.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more customization of the cabin and offered for some jets wide seats in the corridors.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but it could distract from the wave of 777X-sales.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Veganism is the vegetarianism encyclopedias, differs from this, but in a very significant way.</seg>
		<seg id="1">While vegetarians are eating cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, they provide are not on the menu of a vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan from all the consumption of animal products, including honey is denied.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What remains, one might wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan diet world through a remarkable provokers of wealth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Only are very popular,&quot; said Ute Henkel Mann, the owner of the house of reform, which has a large number of special products for vegans.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Reuben Proctor also visited the store in the Domgasse.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For 13 years, the native New Zealanders vegan, he finds in Lampertheim (almost) everything that he needs to live. &quot;In 1997, I asked my diet and became a vegetarian.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">At the turn of the century was the next step and I became a vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;But the conviction was not only because of the diet, but because of the footwear of choice,&quot; says Proctor, art leather prefers plain leather.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He realized that there is no animal products in other everyday concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is primarily a vegan ethics.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I do not want to see animals must die for me,&quot; Proctor, the maxim of vegan, which covers the entire consumer behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Instead of burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears hinterherzutrauern, vegans have quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;It is a double bonus,&quot; says Proctor today, &quot;in fact, vegan waiver, no asceticism, but it is an asset.&quot; The assumption that the nutritional change the selection of dining options, Proctor leads on the power of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And it is exactly these conditions could also have some well-intentioned attempt to fail.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The addictive is a crucial factor, which leaves many fast, as with smoking,&quot; Proctor is a comparison.</seg>
		<seg id="16">And: &quot;certain tastes are not identify animal.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">Often it is the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;But you can also create the same effect in other ways,&quot; the vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Bring to a barbecue Proctor example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Vegan sausages.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He pays attention to a balanced, the colourful intake, once rich taste.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, it is legitimate.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;It will taste, but it is not only to reduce animal food,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Damage to health, to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that he had not suffered.</seg>
		<seg id="24">For me, the change has had a positive aspect.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I am no stranger to cholesterol and increased vitamin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are high-performance athletes who are exclusively vegan diet.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;My blood values are, I am often check,&quot; Mr. Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In particular the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus-critics warn.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Because animals are fed with feed, rather than to graze on the pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the cool quiet of vitamin B12 share is high,&quot; Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;My B12 values are in order,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Distances should not Proctor for food fund raising.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Basic food resources are there, and every supermarket has soy milk and other products.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Everything I need, I find on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="35">And I buy something special.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that is what is known in the&quot; ordinary &quot;finished products.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="37">Anyway, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than is commonly believed.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;In the kitchen, there is much to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not partially achieve better results,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could bring his in-laws.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Families of the vegan gives a new condiment.</seg>
		<seg id="41">This dynamic, when you cook, has a new significance.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;The situations that can arise as diverse as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="43">He was, of course, but also scepticism.</seg>
		<seg id="44">You enjoy my food?</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;I feel bad because I drink milk?&quot; - with questions of this kind should be acting as vegans with tact.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;I do not reject people, yes, I am part of this society,&quot; Proctor would not enclaves.</seg>
		<seg id="47">And a closer look at the everyday world seems to be not so vegan as suspected - and not the vegan so limited in everyday life, as is commonly supposed.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Even fast food is allowed.</seg>
		<seg id="49">French fries are everywhere!</seg>
		<seg id="50">&quot;Many Dönerläden offer falafel or a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In a pizzeria is ordered to pasta dishes, or a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="52">The restaurants are so slow it.</seg>
		<seg id="53">&quot; When I started 13 years ago, vegan diet, everything was much more difficult, &quot; the New Zealanders can locate a development: &quot; you must talk to the people, they warn.</seg>
		<seg id="54">&quot;If enough, they might be inclined to supplement the menu,&quot; he hopes.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Vegan restaurants, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café bird.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Proctor is the wish that other restaurants have at least a vegan dish on the menu.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusively.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Meat dishes are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they are different from,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way, mostly from the outset,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="61">But the shopping vegan products can be rather difficult at the beginning.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Especially if you can learn to understand the additives in animal peanuts as color donors can leave seems to comply with the ethics with so many obstacles and traps quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: &quot;Veganissimo - personal content and their alternatives,&quot; explains the many content substances, the food but also cleaning are buried.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot; Gradually, it developed a scanner and knows it has to pay attention to the signs and logos, &quot; sometimes it is better to take small steps as or to stumble, &quot; Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="65">The vegan, it is an important moral enough to raise awareness.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Perhaps he is not quite that his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to take a critical look at his habits.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a lifetime of nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In tests on humans will be needed more tests, which can take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the first results are good.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We are very message that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all the methods on the market, but that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,&quot; says Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information for the manufacture of nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus infected selectively liver cells, which produce a constant stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies to the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, creating a no-nicotine-High.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohamed Morsi, the presidential oath, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; as he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country, and thus the succession of Hosni Mubarak, the 16 months earlier had been driven out of office.</seg>
		<seg id="3">With his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He put the oath in front of the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile and is based on an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said the 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the US, and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that since its founding in 84 years, mostly as a banned organisation, the government targeted.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11.00 p.m. local time in a small car convoy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidential pomp Mubarak-era was only briefly stopped traffic, so that the car convoy could cross the usually bustling street that connects the city centre, with the southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">As an uncharismatic &quot;Ersatzrad&quot; the Brotherhood has mocked his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted the aspirations of the uprising in 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak to your destination.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Egypt today is a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; said dressed in a blue suit with a red tie Morsi judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he craftsman sworn in.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his maiden speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He was officially welcomed by an army band played the national anthem, he was listening to Habachtstellung.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of those present in the largest audience of the university with chanting &quot;the army and the people are one hand&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education University of Cairo has developed into a stronghold of Islamist groups of students in the 1970s.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi, on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birth place of the uprising last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers, the SCAF assumed by the turn of the office of head of state.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But with the divestment of the official oath before the court and not in front of the Parliament, as usual, he is pandering to the will of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 U.S. dollars from passengers on their flight hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though, in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers are likely to keep the whole box.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new fee applies to hand luggage in the baggage compartment of the seat, small bags under the seat remain free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said it charged $25, when the fee will be paid in advance and $100 for travelers who paid only on the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said, the fee of $100 is introducing travelers to move in advance of the payment.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We do not want to charge this amount,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second to checked baggage fees.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers who tried to circumvent this, therefore, as much as possible, plugged in your hand luggage, which means that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded on the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O 'Malley said, the new fee, it is not really about money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to find space in the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that a passenger on the flight of Frontier may charge a baggage may have to pay for the next person but $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O 'Malley said, the website of Frontier and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed about the fee before they come to the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The new hand baggage fee of Frontier is only in the summer, we do not yet have an exact date.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often grumble at baggage charges and other fees, airlines like to fall back on.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street, the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel, after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Most so far, however, the fingers of charges for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago, the first to charge for hand luggage, and later, Allegiant Air, a low-cost carriers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such a fee is closely followed the Hungarian Wizz Air, the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, the additional charges.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit $50 million a year equals.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position in Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious what would happen to him on the flight, when passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The boarding process was one of the smoothly I have experienced in my career in aviation,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see gnashing and palpable discussions on the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;The plane was full,&quot; he said, &quot;and the boarding as lubricated.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier spirit is also $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, are likely to keep the whole box and free coffee will be added.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Water is still free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways had briefly tried in 2008 to demand for soft drinks money, but that was seven months later, after passengers complained and had no other large company adjusted.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Frontiers step to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to customers on its own website.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It provides all companies an incentive to get passengers to the direct purchase with them via an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Frontier, however, is the most in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, the company started, when booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday the miles were again cut to 25 percent of the flight.</seg>
		<seg id="37">A flight booked with a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles customers therefore only 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Passengers can also book exclusively to the direct purchase on the website of Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The revenue fell by 9 percent and passenger capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report, which was published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.,.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic has tried to get under the sale of the company's finances of Frontier.</seg>

		<seg id="0">John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that US spying was &quot;inappropriate gone too far&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission softening the defensive attitude of the US in terms of its surveillance programs, he said that the espionage was &quot;inappropriate gone too far in some cases.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The foreign minister also admitted that he bore responsibility for the fact that we have on &quot;autopilot&quot; with Barack Obama, as the explosive revelations of the whistleblower, but Edward Snowden about the NSA spying activities were publicly.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The leaked information is the U.S. government from its allies in a diplomatic uproar.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In a speech transmitted by video link on the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: &quot;there is no question, the President and I and others in the government of some of the things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to 9/11.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Then he confessed to the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US spying have crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;in some cases, it is unreasonable to have gone too far.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The President is determined to create clarity and, therefore, a thorough investigation so that no one should feel that the abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I can assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and saved many lives through its surveillance operations.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: &quot;we are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow up.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is a radical extremism in the world, the intent is to kill people to attack to blow up and governments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So what if they would be able to intercept and stop it before it happens?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We have actually plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, US lawmakers to travel to Europe, in order to dispel the doubts about the alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need for the anti-terror efforts continue to cooperate with the US, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said that he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and be concerned about their threats to participate because of frustration with the monitoring by the National Security Agency to anti-terrorist organisations.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism remain on board,&quot; said Murphy, who is the first time in the Senate, as a democrat and as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for external relations and European affairs, in an interview in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Moreover, I am going to Europe, in order to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the secret service announced this week that the reports were untrue and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Other revelations from cited passed on documents from Snowden that the NSA monitored phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other state leaders around the world.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and said that this was normal on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In all the tumult, said Murphy, his authority is preparing a tour of the Congress, which is due to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The names of the other Members are to be published in the coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He said the exact itinerary will be worked out.</seg>
		<seg id="24">While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip is the improvement of relations, he also said that there would be some &quot;serious words.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">He said that the European governments should their people to be honest about the type of spying programs that they themselves for years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;We can change our surveillance programmes and better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy,&quot; says Murphy.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">30 were proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Distant worlds.</seg>
		<seg id="4">More than 1000 planets in other stars, astronomers have already found.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Whether or not there is at least some of them life, nobody knows.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The selection is difficult: you should look for gravitational waves?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Or explore the origin of the cosmos?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life?</seg>
		<seg id="9">These questions are just the leaders of the European Space Agency (Esa.</seg>
		<seg id="10">They are looking for ideas for its program &quot;cosmic vision&quot; for two major space projects that will contribute enormously to the research.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The budget for such &quot;l missions&quot; each is approximately EUR 1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The start will be expected to 2028 and 2034.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At the beginning of September, in Paris, the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">30 were ideas for debate, five of them have now been shortlisted.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Many bodies evaluate the proposals, push the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A total of four major issues has chosen the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated &quot;cosmic vision&quot; to find answers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?</seg>
		<seg id="19">The exact processes for the development of stars from large clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit stars - they are still in the dark.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can arise?</seg>
		<seg id="22">In order to analyse this issue will start in 2017, the space telescope &quot;Cheops,&quot; with the 500 already known planetary systems in our neighbourhood.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission, with a budget of EUR 150 million.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With larger instruments could analyze the astronomers erdähnliche planets, and even the composition of their atmospheres and search for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: gases, which are regarded as an indicator for biological activity.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How does the solar system?</seg>
		<seg id="26">Ultimately, this question is to say what the conditions for the emergence of life.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particles of radiation emanating from the solar system.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In our solar system, these processes can examine.</seg>
		<seg id="29">With the &quot;solar Orbiter&quot; Esa already has a mission of the M-class (the budget is around half a billion euros) for this question.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The probe will start in 2017 and closely monitor the sun's surface and activity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They want to find out what the role of the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The Esa is the first of the three L-missions of the &quot;cosmic Vision&quot; program.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The probe &quot;juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey expected to 2022.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Eight years later, they explore Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europe Kallisto and Ganymede.</seg>
		<seg id="36">What are the basic physical laws of the universe?</seg>
		<seg id="37">The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the known laws of nature are still valid.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Maybe there are deviations, the physicists could point the way to a new theory that all known laws of nature.</seg>
		<seg id="39">How the universe is and what is it?</seg>
		<seg id="40">13.7 billion years ago the universe was created by the Big Bang.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In addition to the usual matter of stars, planets and creatures like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, which is accelerating the expansion of the universe.</seg>
		<seg id="42">So far, the researchers do not know what the laws of physics in the first of the ' Big Bang ' split second were valid, nor what is dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="43">&quot;Euclid,&quot; the Esa has already granted a mission, whose launch is planned for 2020.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe, for the first time in the whole sky and thus allow conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Who could make the race</seg>
		<seg id="46">Of the 30 proposals are only two left at the end of the selection process.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The best chances of approval as L-mission, according to many experts &quot;e-Lisa&quot;, a claim concept for the detection of gravitational waves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="49">They have been found to date.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Elisa could create the hope, the scientists behind the project.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The mission provides an existing for two or three probes detector, which is stationed in space.</seg>
		<seg id="52">He could, in contrast to plants on Earth gravitational waves, which are in the Big Bang, and provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.</seg>
		<seg id="53">Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope named &quot;Athena&quot;, which will explore, among other things, black holes, &quot;icy planets,&quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism,&quot; a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder&quot; to detect and investigate the erdähnliche planet.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After intense criticism of President Obama yesterday backed down on his oft-repeated, clear promise: &quot;if you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation, Republicans cast the president in the last few days, he had misled the American public.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yesterday, Obama watered down its original promise.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance, they can,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called for those Americans who have received such messages, to look on the free market for a new insurance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Most citizens could get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or lower than predicted.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;They come up with a better offer,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The government called it a little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance would have to look for another tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Parents of inter-sex children can choose &quot;sex&quot; undetermined</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany is the first European nation, in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Newborn will no longer rigidly assigned male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Under the new law, parents do not have more sex for such children, but can &quot;undecided&quot; or &quot;not&quot; on the birth certificate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The law aims to take the pressure from parents, so they have to make any hasty decisions regarding operations for a gender-assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against inter-sexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A sexual person said, according to BBC years later: &quot;I am neither man nor woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I remain a patchwork quilt, which was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Estimated is one of 2000 children each year, either as a boy or a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They belong to the sexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis &quot;Sexualdifferenzierungsstörung&quot; (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson was perhaps more sexually.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Understanding the gender identification is still not very well, but most experts in the U.S., you should use the best available information on the gender assignment, if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child, before you decide, if any, for an operation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law &quot;sound&quot; for a good cause.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Sexual interaction children an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but that does not apply to most children,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It could be a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the developing identity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity, are not very accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one knows why it happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are defined by Trans sexual or trans-gender people, because their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, neither exclusively male or female, it is typically both at the same time, or not clear as one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics were bailed in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals or chromosome structure and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that inter-sexual and trans-gender people in professional life and about the extent of harassment, violence and crime prejudice.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Not consistent with the image of gender boys now have a special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults, male or female &quot;third sex on official documents.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, Australians Norris May-Welby (52) as the world's first &quot;sex&quot; person, after a court had granted the life-long maintenance of a &quot;not&quot; gender status.</seg>
		<seg id="24">German identity cards, in addition to M and W, in future, a third allocation, X for sexually, the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighbouring France gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, signed dozens of French members of the country's strict Catholic a petition that the ' gender ' theory should be removed from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The US website Catholic Online has also spoke out against the German law on the grounds that &quot;if the world is being dragged into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist another two pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">The mother of a newborn in Maryland told baby zone, it would be better if babies at birth is assigned a gender.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;The parents ' existence is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child,&quot; she said of the parents ' website.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and security.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, were children who were born with both male and female parts, called a hermaphrodite after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ten years ago, the medicine regarded sex as something that can be erased and then rebuild.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But in the meantime, questioned the ethical foundations of an operation now know how complex is the gender identity, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child at the turn of the sex of their allocation.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot; The middle of the 20th century, we called this a &quot; psychiatric emergency ', &quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If such a child was born, then called the psychiatrist, but the surgeons.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that sex is malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives, such as the parents of a child-rearing – beings interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and coined as to whether a person is a male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in a known under the title &quot;John/Joan&quot; case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, castrated the child and to remove his testicles and then bring up as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but he did not,&quot; says Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married to a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">With 38 but he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practice this model.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of this sex operations to the public, who are not happy with the result. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life &quot; as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So external body and testicles shortly after birth were surgically removed in 1976, and he was brought up as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He received female hormones at the age of 12.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I am not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At the age of 18, he should Vaginalplastik.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But, because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he found was shocking.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was at my birth – and no one has ever said.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a DSD, the body does not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After he had learned the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had to remove his breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The operation has become infertile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today he is fighting for others in an organisation called Interface Project for more sexual people are perceived as normal.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, leader of the law in California-based group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law could encourage &quot;for stamping and stigma.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to give the child a ' not ',&quot; she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that favours intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think it would be better to wait for the male or female sex and then.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we still do not know how the law will have an impact, so we can only speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults recognition as a third sex.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law is about the allocation of childbirth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This is not a fight, which should be small children at this time.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, they can decide on their bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologin from Pitts Burg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law &quot;authorize&quot; both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because of the Rezeptordefektes target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but not a uterus and no ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Today, Katie 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a co-worker in the child psychiatry.</seg>
		<seg id="74">She is infertile, but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents room, so they do not have to make decisions in haste,&quot; said Baratz.</seg>
		<seg id="76">It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this way, everything is in order, the child is large and loves it.</seg>
		<seg id="78">It has a wonderful baby and the parents of happiness.</seg>
		<seg id="79">And we should not rush to make an operation that will not undo.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that reconciles the parents, because they believe that they would not do the right thing,&quot; she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Ultimately, the child decides on the sex, which is more suited to him – and it is wonderful.</seg>
		<seg id="82">Children will be able to make the decision.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in the car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe the solution to be found in a small black box, the space in the dashboard of each car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, which are all mileage and the information to the authorities, heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and planning offices of the federal states to review the outdated system of financing American roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The normally rather boring road planning suddenly has sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarian have allied with environmental groups and that the government of the small boxes to record mileage – and, possibly, where they were – and then use the information for the calculation of modest tax.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Tea Party is appalled.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American civil rights association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and a series of data protection concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But while the Congress cannot agree on an approach, several federal states wait no longer.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are currently looking at how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, in which drivers pay per mile driven.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of drivers have the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS tracking, already tested.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This really is a must for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There is nothing that we only use may be,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, business leaders of the Southern California Assn. of government, which is planning a record of miles in all California motorists in the federal state in 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The way we pay these taxes will change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump is broke.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But in America will no longer be filled as much as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars use less fuel.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not increased in 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians cars with high fuel prices, not to raise the tax by a penny.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gas tax is simply not capable of the future,&quot; says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His federal government recently 500 cars equipped with black boxes with a mileage-based payment system will be tested.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;The long term, is the most sensible alternative,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Bureaucrats call it miles-based user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Not surprisingly, the idea of urban liberals, because the tax could be example of ways to influence the behaviour that congestion and climate-damaging emissions to be reduced.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Californian planners rely on the system in formulating policies with which the ambitious objectives of the federal state, enshrined in law on climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he is the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are taken with the idea to pay drivers to set back.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president for directives in Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The people directly pay for what they get.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers had asked the Congress in a report in 2011 to move in the direction of miles-based billing.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The US Senate last year approved an expensive $90 million pilot project, which includes 10000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the thrust and responding to the concerns of Members from rural areas, the people who must often many miles on the way to work or in the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several federal states and cities nichtsdestotrotz move on their own in this direction.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most active is Oregon, which is currently being recruited 5000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon pay the fees miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal government.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="36">New York City also is considering.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois is testing it in limited with trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 federal states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently studying how to introduce the amendment.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue its every move.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and management at the transport ministry of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It did not.</seg>
		<seg id="43">As the trial started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;it would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph in adult surveillance devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of a number of federal states look now that affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
		<seg id="46">So, Khan, the public would be comfortable.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The company is not originally set out to help federal states in the taxation of drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Rather, it was her goal in an emerging market for car insurance to gain a foothold in which drivers on the basis of miles.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices tested are interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only limited information, which are regularly uploaded via modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People are more willing to participate if their speed and sites are not recorded,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, business manager of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">In some of these public pilot programs have been big mistake.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">Experiment in Oregon planners to give drivers a range of options to choose from.</seg>
		<seg id="55">You can opt for a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they choose a device and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the federal state.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with a smaller number who.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which is also to pay parking fees, insurance must be paid for driving distances and speed data in real time by other vehicles, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists would be motivated by the added value of the benefits of the system, to take part,&quot; says a planning document of the city.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some traffic planners, however, are wondering whether all this talk about paying per mile is not only a huge distraction.</seg>
		<seg id="61">The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the area of the San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by simply increasing the fuel tax.</seg>
		<seg id="62">An additional one-off fee or an annual levy motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline will be imposed, so that they pay a fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no need for an operation, albeit an aspirin is sufficient,&quot; explains Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists about their privacy and many other things.</seg>

		<seg id="4">To tell the truth, however, is not a crime.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Security concerns grow in Mozambique in the face of clashes between influential personalities</seg>
		<seg id="1">Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo, under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration of peace.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want peace, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, leader of an investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">They fear for the future of the country has exchanged their clothing business against a T-shirt with the inscription &quot;we call for security&quot; in Portuguese, and on Thursday joined the crowd on the independence square of the capital.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement, more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in a bid to destabilise the independent government of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It has become an opposition party after the peace treaty in 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts consider it unlikely that the country back into a full-scale conflict trap, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For the fast-growing economy is a lot at stake, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring into the country in the next few years, investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies like Rio Tinto and Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are blaming each other for the tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes, it could have on October 17, its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos attacked.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The escalated attacks on the former rebels, government troops Renamo-bases attacked and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government is Renamo blamed for the clashes and the organisation accused of attacking soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He told AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama himself as a &quot;loser&quot;, the &quot;all its remaining forces wants to prove that the government can impose its decisions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo the peace agreement in 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the FT that he had meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;Here we have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who heads collide,&quot; says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique-expert.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them is good in the negotiations and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Renamo, which has pushed for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted as an attempt to ailing movement, the use of force to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Renamos electoral success shrink since 1992, while a new party, which was founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mazanga claimed that Guebuza, whose resignation, when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency,&quot; Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear what capacity Renamo, but it has been disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south routes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but Beira port, mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio announced a month for the use of the railways, after Renamo an attack on the track.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability have increased the frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media coop, an independent media company, because many people already were concerned about the corruption, the slow progress in the development and a recent kidnapping wave.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one finds solutions to the problems,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar sultans, a demonstrator, said, people simply wanted stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Not interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="13">Then in 2008, Obama moved into office, he had approval voting values of 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if from a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember these optimistic times, they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years since I have for the first time, really has changed.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But there is nothing that I imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I also believe that the political party blocking tactics have too many efforts, with whom our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after I have defended countless times, the Obama administration to colleagues and friends, I am trying to enlighten.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I have reached a point of political desperation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Republican obstructionism cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers should be punished, the wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki was an American state, was murdered without trial, which is why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It does not justify the findings of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to restrain the media are the &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And the most recent cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know if that is what I expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If I could understand that the government could contradict the previous political campaigns with 18.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Apparently, the Abgeordnetenamt no predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And that bothers me the most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I was re-elected in 2012, Obama, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed not his direction and positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes we had for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But with the drop in approval voting values for Obama to 45% this week to return to 2008 is even tougher in this book.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama has had a severe loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In a meeting with the election officials after the decision, he told his staff, they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want us to find our magic,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We need to remember who we are.</seg>
		<seg id="42">There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more.</seg>
