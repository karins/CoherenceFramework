		<seg id="0">Business NSA underlines the complete lack of debate on the information</seg>
		<seg id="1">How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which of with dimensions offends itself as a public by convening the ambassador of the United States on October 21st, and does other prohibit the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of rumour of the presence on its board Edward Snowden?</seg>
		<seg id="2">In my opinion, there are two levels of answer on behalf of the French government.</seg>
		<seg id="3">When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama or when the Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius convenes the ambassador of the United States, they react to a true discovery, which is that of the extent of the American monitoring on the whole of the communications in France.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Isn't it surprising lira in the columns of the World at a few weeks of interval on the one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a judgment of listenings of the French Foreign Office by the NSA?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Wouldn't there be like a vague hypocrisy of your share?</seg>
		<seg id="6">The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the research of the interest and relevance of information which makes it possible to each citizen to forge an opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by the American diplomacy of policy issues or others in the whole world, we consider indeed that, in comparison with the American power, that constitutes an important lighting.</seg>
		<seg id="8">When we describe the American systems of interception against the French diplomacy in the United States, it is not to in no case to make indignant us at this practice, it is to describe the world such as it is.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Did France profit from furnished information by the NSA concerning of the terrorist operations aiming our interests?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Can one deprive himself of American collaboration?</seg>
		<seg id="11">The installation for approximately ten years of technological tools for interception very powerful by the United States, but also by France, has officially been justified by the fight against terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moreover, in this field, France and the United States in particular set up quasi daily cooperation procedures and information exchanges and which are described on both sides like essential.</seg>
		<seg id="13">By way of an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal zones with Miranshah was announced to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="14">France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the area of the Sahel to the American services, and, on the other hand - it was already quickly said -, the Americans can give information to the French about other areas of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Thus the basic problem behind this business NSA is not so much the capacity or the right of the countries to obtain tools with interception, only the question of the preliminary complete lack of debate, in particular within the Parliaments, about the justification of such systems, the perimeter which must be theirs, and, in the final analysis, the question of the attacks to freedoms.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What risks really the United States? a degradation of their image?</seg>
		<seg id="17">One denounces them in vain, I do not see how they could be punished.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The risk run by the Americans can be double.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The first, it is when their allies - and that was the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes in the more high summit of their State, were supervised.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where the diplomatic relations with the United States were tightened.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Another effect can be him more economic: more and more of European companies or South American balk, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American people receiving benefits subjected to the American laws, and thus to the influence of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Last element: the vast movement of revelations engaged by media of the whole world, which contributes to hitherto engage a debate on the practices of monitoring of the intelligence services almost non-existent, could push the legislators, including American, to reconsider the powers which they gave at their intelligence services.</seg>

		<seg id="17">Thursday, he pled so that the international community carries out a “third world war” against Al-Qaida.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The principle of a help increased in Iraq as regards security is supported by influential Republican senators and democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, allotting the responsibility to him partial of the resumption for violences by its “sectarian and authoritative policy”.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They as required of Barack Obama as it make understand in Nouri Al Maliki that “the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government constitutes a serious problem in our bilateral relation”.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists developed a vaccine anti-nicotine which could remove the pleasure that one takes to smoke a cigarette.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Only one proportions vaccine could protect with life from the mice from the dependence to nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Other tests are necessary before beginning the tests on the human being, but the Professeur Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College of New York declared that the first signs were encouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="4">“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will be able to help of the million smokers who tried to stop, exhausting all the methods now available on the market, but discover that their addiction is sufficiently strong to overcome these various approaches”, Professeur Cornell declared.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus which was modified to transport genetic information necessary to design antibodies anti-nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus repugnant in a selective way cells of the liver, which then starts to produce a regular flow of antibody.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies track all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevented the smoker from having his nicotine amount.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the time as of tests, the vaccinated mice to which one gave then nicotine continued their activity normally.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But the mice which had not been vaccinated “were alleviated”, the researchers declared, signs that nicotine had reached their brain.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The experiments are described in the review Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The previous vaccines against the tobacco proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The injections were to be repeated so frequently so that the levels of antibody remain high that they were too expensive and not very practical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine should be quite lower because it transforms the cells of the liver into antibody factories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professeur Crystal declared that if the future vaccine of human use were completely sure, one could manage it with the children before they are tempted to test a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction with nicotine.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more probable than it is used by the smokers who want to stop smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">“They will know that if they start again to smoke, they will take there no pleasure because of the vaccine anti-nicotine, and that will be able to help them to lose their bad habits”, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists declared that the results were interesting but announced that research much thorough was necessary.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Friday, Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) widened its investigation to know if Mr. Obeid had put pressure on several Ministers for the State to renew his beams in Circular Quay, where Obeid have two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without there being invitation to tender.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: The air passengers can from now on use gadgets on board planes (but not to pass a call with their mobile phone)</seg>
		<seg id="1">The passengers of the airline companies will be able to use their electronic devices of door with door for reading, working, to play games, to look at films and to listen to music – but not to speak on their mobile phone – under the terms of the new very expected directives published Thursday by Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But the passengers should not expect immediate changes.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The speed with which the change will be set up will vary from one airline company to another, declared the administrator of the FAA Michael Huerta at the time of a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The airline companies will have to prove with the FAA that theirs planes respect the new directives and that they updated the training manuals of the team members and the rules concerning the storage of the devices to be in conformity.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA declared that it had already received plans of certain airline companies aiming at widening the use of the electronic devices on theirs planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue are part of the companies which already subjected plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">“According to the plan, we could approve a widened use of the electronic devices very soon”, the FAA in a declaration indicated.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, the passengers must extinguish their smartphones, shelves and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They are not supposed to relight them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10 000 feet and that the commander gives his green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The passengers are supposed to extinguish their devices at the time of the descent of the plane before the landing and not to relight them until the plane landed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the terms of the new directives, the airline companies whose planes are correctly protected from the electronic interferences will be able to authorize the passengers to use their devices during takeoffs, the landings and the bearing on the ground, declared the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most new airliners and other planes which were modified so that the passengers can use Wi-Fi at more raised altitudes, should satisfy the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of Association of Professional Flight Waiting, is known as happy of these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">“Once the new policy put in work in full safety – and we will work in close collaboration with the carriers for that – it will be advantageous with everyone”, explained Glading in a declaration.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We are frankly tired to feel us as “head nurses” when it is about this question.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But it will be always interdict to connect itself to Internet for surfing, to exchange e-mails and of SMS or to download data below 10 000 feet, declared the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The passengers will have to put their smartphones, shelves and other devices in plane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thus still not of Words With Friends, the online game style Scrabble which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when it was expelled with great noise of a plane of American Airlines after having refused to extinguish his device whereas the device was parked with the door.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And the devices heavier as the laptops will have to always be arranged because they could wound somebody if they flew through the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The lawful power concerning the mobile phones belongs to Federal the Communications Commission and not to the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The FAA can raise prohibition on certain electronic devices during takeoff and the landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national expert in transport safety on CBS News, declared that the mobile phones were always regarded as presenting a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">“The mobile phones are truly a problem, not only because they could possibly create interferences with the instruments of navigation, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disturb the antenna-relays of mobile telephony if they are used on board”, Rosenker declared.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authorizes a broader use of the personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The pressure weighing on the FAA was reinforced during last years to soften the restrictions relating to their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Detractors such as the sénatrice Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., support that there does not exist any safety reason valid for these prohibitions.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of the devices became omnipresent.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Certain studies indicate that at least a third of the passengers forgets to extinguish their devices, or do it deliberately.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA started to limit the use of the electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interferences with the instruments of navigation and communication when the passengers transported FM radios, the gadget high-tech of then.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The new airliners depend much more of the electric systems that former generations of planes, but they are also conceived to resist the electronic interferences and are approved by the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airline companies have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi with altitudes of cruising for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The planes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems resist the interferences also better.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of the airliners should allow a broader use of the electronic devices under the terms of the new directives, declared Huerta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The electronic devices of today in general emit radio transmissions of power much lower than the former generations of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The readers of e-books, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when a page is turned.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Amazon.com is part of those which put pressure for an easing of the restrictions concerning the use of the electronic devices by the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, the officers of the company charged an airliner with readers of e-books Kindle and made it fly to see whether there were problems, but there was none of it.</seg>
		<seg id="40">That inspired to the members of the advisory committee of the FAA of the mixed feelings as for the question of knowing if the use of the devices presents or not a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers declared that he thought that the interferences coming from the devices were real, even if the risk were tiny.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other members of the committee declared that there exist only anecdotic reports emanating from pilots who indicate that the devices can interfere with the systems of a plane, and that most between them are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorizes the pilots to be requested from the passengers to extinguish their devices during the instrument landings under conditions of low visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group of the industry of the travel was pleased with the changes, calling them of arrangements full with good sense for travellers equipped with technologies.</seg>
		<seg id="45">“We are happy that the FAA recognizes that an experiment pleasant passenger is not incompatible with the security”, Roger Dow, President and director of the U.S. Travel Association declared.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Australian air passengers will have to continue to extinguish their shelves and their smartphones during takeoff and the landing in spite of the gesture of the United States aiming at softening the regulation relating to the electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Aviation American Administration left the open door to the American carriers for a change of their procedures so that the passengers can read e-books, look at videos or play games on their devices during the critical phases of flight provided that they are in mode “plane”.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The passengers can already do it during most of the flight, but of many people find painful not to be able to reach their e-books during takeoff and the landing.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Australian carriers examine the decision which obliges the American carriers to carry out an important work in order to respect the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend in the immediate future to change their procedures.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Civilian Aviation Safety Authority also declared that it examined the announcement but stressed that the restrictions relating to the use of the electronic devices during the critical phases of flight were always in force in Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="6">“the CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of the electronic devices in the plane”, she declared.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The question is the object of a regulation which obliges the owners of aircraft to guarantee the maintenance of the security permanently and the passengers to respect the security instructions given by the team members.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Virgin, who already spoke in the CASA about his intention to extend the use of his system of entertainment on board using Wi-Fi technology, was opened with a change, but declared that it would follow the regulator.</seg>
		<seg id="9">“We would favorably accommodate a revision of the CASA which would allow the use of the electronic devices because we really think that would improve the experiment customer now that we lay out (of the system of entertainment on board using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes”, indicated a spokesperson.</seg>

		<seg id="11">“In accordance with our current policy, the electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and the landing, and we do not intend in the immediate future to change that”, she declared.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The decision of the FAA applies to the American airline companies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, we are always interested by the lawful evolutions which could profit with the passengers, and we will examine closely the decision of the FAA and the reasons of this one.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For the American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline company to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The carriers will have to show that theirs planes can tolerate radio operator interferences coming from electronic devices, just as to re-examine the handbooks, the equipment of formation, the programme of transport of hand luggage and the instructions provided to the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">“As soon as an airline company checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can authorize the passengers to use light portable electronic devices, like shelves, readers of e-books and smartphones at all the altitudes”, the FAA declared.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask the passengers to extinguish their aircraft during the landing.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The group also recommended that the heavier devices are arranged in full safety under the seats or in the top chambers during takeoff and the landing.</seg>

		<seg id="3">If all the patients had access to effective care to alleviate their sufferings, besides being able to stay at home, very little of them would like to put an end to their days, according to a spokesperson of the Canadian Association of the palliative care, Maryse Bouvette.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Halloween 2013: In figures</seg>
		<seg id="1">When I was small, Halloween was magic.</seg>
		<seg id="2">My sister and me were authorized to eat candies, with going to lay down us late and disguising us to go in the vicinity.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Today, I became more skinflint.</seg>
		<seg id="4">These two last years, I did not distribute only one candy and I will certainly not do it more this year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the statistics show that I am the black sheep when one speaks about Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The majority of the Americans – 158 million of them makes some – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of 6.9 candy Md$, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Until I impatiently wait each festival of Halloween, they are the trends.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The disguises should account for 1.2 Md$ out of the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This year, the inanimate sexy objects make fury.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The women do not need more to be the professional sexy ones; they can also be sexy food like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As regards the men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the televised series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of the space of Daft Punk will appear among our Instagram photographs this year.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Google, the most required disguises are the zombies, Batman, the pirates and the witches.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I suppose that there is no evil to remain traditional.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We disguised our dogs last year and, with my great astonishment, they were not only.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In fact, the Americans will spend 330 M$ in disguises for animals this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That done many curious dogs disguised in hotdogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">When they are candies, one glandouille not.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Americans will spend 1.9 candy Md$ this year, according to the cabinet Nielsen.</seg>
		<seg id="19">That represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and bars Clark.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is a super news for the 41 million children who go to hunting to candies in their vicinity, according to the American department of the Trade.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In fact, we will buy and, we do not tell tall tales, will consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The candies corn are the only thing which one does not want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kg is sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
		<seg id="23">That represents approximately 9 billion corn grains.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is a mystery which I did not manage yet to elucidate.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the haunted houses.</seg>
		<seg id="26">They bear the best names, as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which is in fact a true prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In fact, there exists 1 200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generates approximately 500 M$ of receipts, according to America Haunts, and that includes these formidable photographs of you pissing you above that your friends put on Facebook and that you cannot remove and on whom a type which you like leaves a comment of the style “pretty head”.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Lastly, let us speak about pumpkins.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Charlie Brown introduced La Grosse Citrouille to us when one was kids, and to carve a pumpkin in the shape of lantern, it is as to decorate a Christmas tree – it is something which one does since one is very small.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fortunately for us, the “trend of baby-pumpkin” began only last year thanks to Pinterest, therefore most between us carved these pumpkins and did not have to sit down inside.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This year, the Americans will spend approximately 106 pumpkin M$, according to the U.S. Census Office.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The pumpkin-lanterns which fade gently on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins was cultivated this year.</seg>
		<seg id="33">If you seek to point out to you more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon with Napa, in California, and try to carve their pumpkin of 922 kg.</seg>

		<seg id="2">“That has not ceased for this morning, the engagements continue in spite of the night”, to AFP an inhabitant of Jomba indicated, linked by telephone around 12:30, and according to which a young girl was wounded by bullets in the morning.</seg>
		<seg id="3">“The intensity of the confrontations decreased a little”, he added, “it seems that the FARDC Armed forces of the DRC pushed back the rebels a little”.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers “had spent the night” to Jomba before going up to the face for a “search operation”.</seg>

		<seg id="13">On the spot, the political leaders of M23 hope to manage an agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">“We finished the talks, it does not remain more that with the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature”, Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the delegation of M23 affirmed, without this information being able to be confirmed immediately governmental side.</seg>
		<seg id="15">M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, former rebels, primarily tutsi, integrated in the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.</seg>

		<seg id="1">With the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, founder president of Mozambique, measuring them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to stress peaceful slogans at the time of a rare public demonstration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">“We want that peace returns; we want stability”, declared Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive officer of an investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Worry for the future of its country, it exchanged its working clotheses against a t-shirt being marked “we want the Portuguese security” before joining the crowd piled up on the place of the Independence of the capital Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">During two weeks, practically the every day ago of the reports mentioning conflicts between the governmental forces and Renamo, the worst fixings since the peace agreement which was signed there is more than 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was formerly a famous rebel movement, constant at the beginning by Rhodesia controlled by white then the government of apartheid of South Africa within the framework as of efforts to destabilize the government independent of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The analysts think that the country should not fall down in an opened conflict, but the recent events shook the foreign investors and the local population.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The challenge is considerable for the economy in full growth since the discovery of enormous gas reserves offshore oil rig and coal layers in the North-West could attract more than 50 Md$ of investments during next years coming from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni d'Italie and Anadarko of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Frelimo, the party in power and the political main force since 1975, and Renamo are rejected the responsibility for the tensions mutually.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo declares that the government is at the origin of the recent confrontations and that he launched an attack against his members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of Renamo, on October 17th.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when the governmental forces tackled the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson of Renamo, according to Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government makes Renamo responsible to have started the conflicts, and shows it to attack soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns concerning instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr. Guebuza declared Wednesday in AFP, the French news agency, that Mr. Dhlakama regarded himself as a “loser” who wanted to use “all the forces that it remained to him to try to prove that it could impose his decisions on the government”.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Frelimo and Renamo insist to say that they wish both to avoid the war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that Renamo gave up the peace agreement of 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He declared with the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was not respected any more by Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">“We want to resume negotiations, but with largest serious”, Mr. Mazanga indicated.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The previous discussions between the parts did not succeed in alleviating the tensions supplied with a series of conflicts this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">“They are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop disputing”, explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer of the open university and specialist in Mozambique.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None them can negotiate well and none them is ready to make the concessions necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections in November having to take place.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The presidential and legislative elections are envisaged the next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Certain commentators have interpreter his use of the force like the attempt at a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure on behalf of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The share of the votes collected by Renamo does not cease dropping since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was created by a former member of Renamo, should obtain one plus a large number of votes with the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw himself at the end of its second mandate the next year – wanted to destroy the democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">“He does not want a democracy multi-party, he does not want elections transparent, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency”, Mr. Mazanga declared.</seg>
		<seg id="28">One does not know exactly which is the capacity of Renamo, but she conducted disturbing attacks flash on the police stations and the vehicles on a major North-South motorway axis.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most fixings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located at several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is, the port from where mining companies, in particular Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio could not any more use the railroad during approximately a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mr. Mazanga was wrongfully timid when it was asked to him whether Renamo would reiterate this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo wanted “to inform the international community that the things do not go well to Mozambique”, Mr. Mazanga indicated.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Instability reinforced frustrations which the government causes, declares Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent company of media, many people being also worried by corruption, the slowness of the development and the recent wave of removals.</seg>
		<seg id="34">“People think that the persons in charge of the future of the country are the government and the president, and that is with the latter to find solutions with the problems”, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said that people wanted only stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">“Nobody worries about Renamo nor of Frelimo, they want just to find peace, they want to have a free access with the roads”, he added.</seg>

		<seg id="4">“The charge suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is from now on the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to remain in front of the house of people while hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to like to present the history to people to see what they say”, Mr. Edis declared.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He declared that NotW used three means to inquire into the subjects: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The editor-in-chief is personally implied in the third.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is obvious that it is with the current of the second, the monitoring, it cannot be about it differently.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But what of it is it first?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Is he aware of the telephone hacking?</seg>
		<seg id="10">He affirms the opposite, but we say “Of course that if”.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The rumours on a connection implying Clarke were taken again in first by the office of the drafting of NotW when a source, testing a sexual attraction towards Miss Pawlby, declared that one had told him: “Do not waste your time with it, it is with Charles.”</seg>
		<seg id="12">A band, on which text messages pirated on its telephone with at least three recoveries were recorded, was seized in the residence of Mulcaire in August 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The investigators also found seizures on the computer of the private detective which concerned Miss Pawlby and his sister arranged in a file “Projects”.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For the period when the detective inquired into it, the grandparents of Miss Pawlby received anonymous calls where one asked them for information on it, Mr. Edis added.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Meanwhile, the old one to defer in chief Neville Thurlbeck and the old one to defer James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of least action of Miss Pawlby.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In a text message that it left him on June 18th 2005, Coulson said: “I have a history which we envisage to publish tomorrow about which I would really like to speak to Charles.”</seg>
		<seg id="17">Mr. Edis explained that the implication of Coulson in the history followed the same diagram as with other important men, such as the former minister for the Interior David Blunkett.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a connection with a married woman whereas itself attended the Co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Coulson and Brooks deny to have conspired with others to pirate telephones between on October 3rd 2000 and on August 9th 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to have carried out telephone hacking.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The federal government maintains that the rescue plan of 325 M$ intended for the wavering health care system is matched strict conditions aiming at guaranteeing that the government of the State will not waste the funds.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Minister federal for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth currently takes “urgent measures” to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The financing, envisaged over 4 years, was decided afterwards of the consultations of the government with the deputy independent of Tasmanie, Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">“The government proposed an emergency rescue plan which, according to us, will regulate the single difficulties with which the State is confronted”, Mrs. Plibersek declared today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The plan of 325 M$ understands a campaign of 31 M$ for nonurgent surgical operations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">2 600 additional operations, in particular in the field of the orthopedic surgery and the cataract, will help to make up for lost time.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Funds are also planned for the private clinics without go to Hobart and Launceston, of better external care, the medical service, management training dedicated to the mental health and the deployment of systems of electronic medical records in the local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">“These investments answer the idea according to which, according to the clinicians of first line, it is the best means of looking after the health care system of Tasmanie”, Mrs. Plibersek declared.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister affirmed that the government of Tasmanie would be confronted with a strict mode of preparation of the reports and reporting.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The State will have to maintain the levels of financing current in order to receive money of the Commonwealth and to prepare monthly reports on the sectors where he spends the additional funds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A composite commission of three people will be made up to guarantee that the State provides the services in the most effective and efficient way possible.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr. Wilkie said today that the 325 M$ will not count for large-thing “unless they are followed of a true reform making it possible to consolidate the public health care system of Tasmanie”.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He nevertheless congratulated the government to have answered at the request of urgent assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">“I hope that the plan of federal assistance will largely contribute to withdraw the public health care system of Tasmanie of the blacklist”, Mr. Wilkie declared.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the government of the State, these additional nonurgent procedures will reverse the recent cuts mainly.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the spokesperson of the opposition as regards health Peter Dutton thinks that the announcement of today is “a makeshift solution”.</seg>
		<seg id="17">“The reason for which we are here is that the worker government of the State withdrew 430 M$ of its health care system”, he declared on ABC TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">One cannot have a government of the State which tears off almost a half-milliard of dollars and the Commonwealth which puts 300 M$, and claim that it is one ostentation day.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr. Dutton visited Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent in additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">It goes in mud, the jungle and crosses rivers to offer a free medical help</seg>
		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle exempts free health care in the villages of Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Dr. Bwelle and his team pass almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are not many doctors in this country of West Africa, hardly 1 per 5 000 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or via your portable device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the year 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect it “CNN Hero of the year”.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This person will receive 250 000 $ to continue her extraordinary work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">During 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father alternating the periods of conscience and unconsciousness and going in hospitals which were not equipped to come to him to the rescue.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was wounded in an automobile accident in 1981 close to Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the beginning, it had only one broken arm, but it contracted an infection which was propagated to its brain, creating a bruise of which it was going to carry the after-effects the remainder of its life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon”, Georges Bwelle declared.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have taken it along abroad if we had had enough money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead of that, Dr. Bwelle spent the years to accompany his father in crammed private clinics and hospitals, so that it obtains any treatment of which it could profit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">“It is not easy”, Mr. Bwelle adds.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can leave the house at 5:00, you ruer at the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">People can die because they wait too long.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation did not change much since the death of the father of Dr. Bwelle in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As comparison, the ratio in the east United States of 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameronians could not pay the consultation.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two people out of five in the country live below poverty line, and almost three quarters of the health expenditure of the country are carried out in the private sector.</seg>
		<seg id="23">“The only problem that they have, it is poverty”, explained Dr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from the life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">After having seen his father and as many his compatriots to suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of the things.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of voluntary practised more than 700 surgical acts free during last year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became doctor himself, working as vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And it created a humanitarian association with nonlucrative goal, ASCOVIME, which goes in the rural areas during the weekends to exempt free health care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, him and its group of voluntary helped nearly 32 000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost all the vendredis, with about thirty people, they pile up in light vans after having fixed medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult grounds to go in the villages which have more the need for assistance.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The chance always does not follow them.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They many times had to push the vehicles to cross muddy rivers or tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they are received as hero: the community organizes a festival, sings and dances and offers the best residences available to them.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, the free health care is a good reason to have fun, and Dr. Bwelle – with his great smile and its overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team starts to receive hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">“We receive 500 people with each visit”, Mr. Bwelle declared.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They live sometimes to 60 km of the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In this itinerant hospital, various health care is lavished.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people receive a treatment against paludism, tuberculosis, malnutrition, the diabetes, the parasites and the sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others can receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free certificate of birth – required document to go to the school, but from many poor families cannot be quite simply allowed to buy it.</seg>
		<seg id="41">The evening, the team practises simple surgical acts under local anaesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations are in general practised in a school, a town hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes in the recovery room to give up his seat to the following person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his voluntary work until the first hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is an exhausting rhythm, but the musicians of the villages help the team in general to remain justified.</seg>
		<seg id="45">“They strike drums all the night to hold us waked up so that we can continue to work”, explained Mr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Sunday, the team turns over downtown, tired but proud of the work which it achieved.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group, composed Cameronian doctors and medical students, practised 700 surgical acts free during last year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those of which they come to the rescue.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man explained that the free operation that it had undergone to look after a hernia would make it possible him to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">“That will change my future and that of my family”, the man declared.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Besides making live this itinerant hospital and to work as surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle works also during the night in doctor's offices deprived around Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It is this second employment, he explains, which finances to 60 % its association; the rest is covered by private gifts.</seg>
		<seg id="52">“I do not know when he sleeps”, declared Katie O' Malley, student in medicine in second year from the university Drexel in Philadelphia and voluntary within the group of Dr. Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="53">It is always at the hospital or trying to find money for its association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For the medical students and the student male nurses like Katie O' Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it is an occasion of training on the ground which they do not have on their premises.</seg>
		<seg id="55">“One could take part in operations to help to sponge blood or to make pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle”, explained Miss O' Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">It is not something which you have the occasion to make in America when you are medical student in second year.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The voluntary students in general pay their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But once in Yaounde, their pension, their transport and teaching are dealt with by Doctor Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">“It is a hero, it does not have there a doubt”, Katie O' Malley declared.</seg>
		<seg id="60">It gives its life for this association, and its desire for helping the Cameronian people is not close dying out.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.</seg>
		<seg id="62">To help the others to live happy by keeping the promise which it made to his father is something which brings an immense joy to him.</seg>
		<seg id="63">“I am so happy when I do this work”, Mr. Bwelle added.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope that he sees what I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">To make laugh people and relieve the pain are the reasons which push to me to do that.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Both France of Pierre Nora</seg>
		<seg id="1">Perplexed, the academics a long time pained to define and locate Pierre Nora.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Professor in the amphitheatres and the classrooms?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Undoubtedly, but by underlining its weak for the Science-Po, short cuts, Advanced studies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Referee of works of others in its office of the street Gaston-Gallimard?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Indeed, but by being unaware of hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Heir to the armchair which did occupy Fontenelle with the French Academy?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Admittedly still, but by knowing that such a sacring could not replace genuine holy oil, that of the thesis, from which it occurred.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They readily recognized in him a large eveillor, presenter and federator of their work, but while pointing out that it was shown not very inclined to produce itself of it.</seg>
		<seg id="9">With this dubious image the monument of the “Places of memory”, to which it attached its name, also contributed.</seg>
		<seg id="10">There the scandalmongers could see a gigantic flea market, presented by a commentator intelligent, equipped with a sharp glance and ballasted of scholarship, but incurably dilettante.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The two works published by Nora here soon two years already established that which passed not to write had written much and well.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The book that here should return justice definitively to him.</seg>
		<seg id="13">One however finds there, once more, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, the jubilation put to jump as to feet together of a subject to the other.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But it is understood quickly that the disparate objects gathered in this book with the so beautiful title bring back the second-hand dealer to only one and even passion: that to discover the node constitutive of the French identity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Why these dramatic calls to the national unit?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Identity: it is a concern of time.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here little, we were collectively invited to give a definition of it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders of then, the French identity was a timeless petrol.</seg>
		<seg id="19">One only had to deploy the accidents of them, and the business, Jacobinism oblige, were entrusted to the prefects and to the sub-prefects, to interpreters authorized.</seg>
		<seg id="20">That which tracking Pierre Nora is very different.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is not posed of heir to an eternal francity, it refuses with the definition.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Anxious analyst of a familiar strangeness, it wanders in a forest of symbols, decree to each step by an object in the form of rebus, tormented irritating questions.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Of which this one, which is born from the company itself: why, in a country so durably installed in its borders, so in the past framed and firmly built, one hears these dramatic calls to the unit?</seg>
		<seg id="24">They are not so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, that to entreat the disorder born of the discords of the French history.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Francs and Gallic, Armagnacs and Burgundian, catholic and Protestant: the forces of division, here, are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="26">And most emblematic is obviously that which splits into two the national history.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As from the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionist.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Second death of the first wanted, but without managing to deny it; concerned contrary to finding of it the sacredness and all the more avid of unit and indivisibility which it had cut the head to that which was the obvious one and powerful incarnation.</seg>
		<seg id="29">And, from there, an invincibly binary nation, shared between left and right-hand side, secularity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To make feel this singularity of the French identity, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that the American escapade of Pierre Nora wellness the heart of its book could.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Because America and France and the other did one a revolution, written a declaration of the rights, wanted to found a new company.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But the American cousinhood does nothing but better underline what is clean for us.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Over there, men who had left their Former regime in England and did not have to be concerned with it any more.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Here, encumbered of an indigenous Former regime, and all the more radical men.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There a consensual revolution when here it sowed the drama and the candied one.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There always honoured founding fathers, and here of the revolutionary ancestors which one pains to make models, and who moreover between-committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="37">There an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, like as many errors being caught up with and of tests to be begun again.</seg>
		<seg id="38">France which from goes away, France which comes</seg>
		<seg id="39">However a time ago when the French believed to be able to sew on again the torn dress of their history, and to overcome the curse of the figure two.</seg>
		<seg id="40">With this 3rd Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora much interest and even tenderness showed: greeting those which then got busy to repair the revolutionary fracture, by teaching with the schoolboys all that in old France prepared modern France obscurely and in their proposer a unified version of their history.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But this pacified identity had only a time.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Here again discusses it, hustled by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of claiming minorities, absorptive in European space.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The book thus offers at the same time the fascinating portrait of France which from goes away and the circumspect draft of France which comes.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With, in bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should book some surprises.</seg>
		<seg id="45">It is discovered there that the tramp was a stay-at-home type.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessional, around the same idea.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The prowler of edges was held with the center of the center.</seg>
		<seg id="48">And that which had deposited, here more than one half-century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had been withdrawn from the initiatory exercise of the thesis, entrusts to us, cum grano salis, which it will have ended up doing it.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Admittedly in a less stiff form, more burst and more subtle.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But let us not mislead there we, quite as constraining.</seg>
		<seg id="51">Because much more than the compulsory figure of the university course, this thesis says the interior need for a life.</seg>

		<seg id="0">How biometrics will invade our lives</seg>
		<seg id="1">Finished the passwords to be typed to reach its smartphone or to pay its purchases?</seg>
		<seg id="2">The American, French researchers or Japanese predict a future to us where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of the telephones and the computers.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Bernard Didier, executive vice president of Morpho, even estimates that “the century will be biometric”.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Only biometrics will make it possible to make sure of the identity of a person realizing of the transactions in a as transverse and transnational universe as Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The organizations dedicated to protection of privacy confirm this passion for biometrics, but worry some.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission of data processing and freedoms authorized 774 systems of recognition of the prints, of the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens…</seg>
		<seg id="7">“Everyone could be identified soon, anywhere and any time”, is moved Justin Brookman, person in charge of the private life of the consumers within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Reasons of such an optimism, at the ones, and pessimism, at the others?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Biometrics will be based on novel methods, which will make it possible to do new favours for the citizens and to the consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Today, in France, the most used biometric data are the digital fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or the fingers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But each one of these techniques has its constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="12">“For example, certain people who work the concrete have the very damaged fingers and their prints are illegible”, Philippe Robin, works manager of the identity field in Thales Communications &amp; Security notes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And the collection as well as the checking of the venous network and the contour of the hand suppose a voluntary and precise gesture people.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is at the same time a security - one cannot collect these data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and thus takes time.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Consequence, of research have been carried out for about twenty years on other approaches, like the recognition of the face or the iris (the coloured part of the eye).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Thanks to the increase in the precision of the sensors and of capacity of calculation of the computers necessary to the data analysis, these techniques become operational.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The precision of the facial recognition was multiplied by ten during five last years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of the laboratories of R &amp; D of Accenture in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With our assistance, the United Kingdom and Holland deployed automatic border posts using the facial recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It is from now on possible to identify a face or an iris moving.</seg>
		<seg id="20">“Today, we undertake researches on the recognition of the voice or the way of walking using sound sensors, but one needs a quiet environment”, indicates Sridhar Iyengar, director of research on the security in Intel Labs.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Single and unfalsifiable marker, the DNA also raises hopes and concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="22">“In the actual position of knowledge, it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data”, confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of the studies, the innovation and the futurology with the CNIL.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the analysis of the DNA is still very long and very expensive.</seg>
		<seg id="24">NEC proposes at the police services legal a bag costing 90,000 euros to analyze samples of DNA on the place of a crime and in one hour.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (to recognize a person among others) and authentification (to make sure that the person is that which she claims to be).</seg>
		<seg id="26">The identification related to until now the identity papers delivery: it is necessary to confront the biometric elements (impressed, photograph, iris) with information which the State has on all the already driven citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="27">That makes it possible to make sure that a person does not try to usurp the identity of someone else.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This principle of comparison can have other applications.</seg>
		<seg id="29">NEC thus proposes the recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or a store.</seg>
		<seg id="30">“We recover the images of the surveillance cameras and let us compare them with the photographs celebrities who circulate freely on Internet”, explains Dany Nassif, charged, at NEC France, of the commercial development for the solutions of biometric identification.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Another use: to take in photograph a fellow which makes the tail in a store, to follow its progression thanks to the facial recognition and to calculate the latency.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The authentification related to at the beginning the physical accesses (protected borders, buildings, canteens…) or logics (opening of a computer).</seg>
		<seg id="33">Was added there, more recently, the control of presence.</seg>
		<seg id="34">“Pointer biometric avoids the phenomenon of the buddy who points for another”, Cyrille Bataller justifies, from Accenture.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But, more and more, the authentification will also relate to the transactions, in particular those carried out starting from devices connected to Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money with certain distributors by introducing its map and by posing its hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the striking of the PIN number.</seg>
		<seg id="37">A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angouleme by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and signs of large distribution: at the time to pay in store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but introduced his finger into a reader who scans the veins.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The experimentation is designed to last six months.</seg>
		<seg id="39">If it is conclusive, the biometric readers could arrive soon in the French tradesmen.</seg>

		<seg id="41">There exist three manners of making biometrics tempting to the eyes of the general public.</seg>
		<seg id="42">First is to explain that it can make save time.</seg>
		<seg id="43">“If, thanks to biometrics, a customer remains in case thirty seconds of less, it is appreciable”, explains the director of a large surface.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a vocal waiter will be able to recognize your voice and to propose custom-tailored options to you.</seg>
		<seg id="45">And, finally, to reassure by proposing the precautions taken to protect the databases.</seg>
		<seg id="46">“The digital fingerprints are stored on a first waiter; the identities of the people are in one second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure case, which is blocked if one tries to move it”, enumerates Philippe Robin, from Thales.</seg>
		<seg id="47">But, for lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches convince really the users.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The specialists in protection of privacy, them, continue to worry.</seg>
		<seg id="49">“Progress of the facial recognition, the multiplication of the surveillance cameras and the enormous quantity of photographs available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: a generalized monitoring”, predicted Andrew Patrick, Police station with protection of privacy in Canada.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to make pay up to 100 $ with the passengers who transport hand luggage on his flights.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to start to make pay up to 100 $ for a hand luggage and 2 $ for a coffee or a soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that the passengers could carry the quill nonopen with them to the descent of the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new expenses of hand luggage relate to the bags arranged in the top chamber, therefore the small bags installed under the seat will be always free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier declared that it would make pay 25 $ if the expenses were paid in advance and 100 $ if the travellers did not pay that once with the door of loading.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The spokesperson of Frontier, Kate O' Malley indicated that the 100 $ were designed to encourage the travellers to pay the expenses in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">“We do not want to make pay this price”, she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The airline companies started to make pay the first and second checked-in baggage in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The passengers who tried to avoid these expenses put as many things as they could in the hand luggage arranged in the top chambers, thus it did not have there often more room in these compartments.</seg>
		<seg id="9">These expenses are a means of making sure that the passengers transport less things on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O' Malley declared that these new expenses will not be really used to collect money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is a question of rendering comprehensible with the most faithful customers of Frontier which it becomes increasingly difficult to find of the place in the top chambers.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The passengers who buy their ticket on the site of the airline company will not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus, a passenger making the tail with a door of Frontier loading could transport a bag free, while the following person in the tail could have to pay 100 $ for a similar bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O' Malley explained why the site and the procedures of recording of Frontier are changing to guarantee that the passengers know the existence of these expenses before arriving at the door.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The expenses of hand luggage of Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date was scheduled.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The passengers often grumble in connection with the expenses of luggage and other expenses, but the airline companies adore them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They estimate that the costs of handling of the luggage are important and that the passengers who want this service should pay it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A good amount of people with Wall Street consider the addition of expenses of luggage as a sign which proves that the airline companies make pay rather expensive to cover the cost of the air travel after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However a good amount of between them did not touch at the expenses of luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. the first expenses of hand luggage had applied three years ago, and the company low-cost Allegiant followed a little later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Only the other company imposing such expenses is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, declared the consultant near airline companies Jay Sorensen, who follows closely the expenses in supplement.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It estimated, in a report of December 2011, that the expenses of hand luggage of Spirit brought back 50 a year M$.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, travelled recently on Spirit and wondered what it was going to find with the door of loading at the time when the passengers would discover the expenses of unusual hand luggage imposed by the company.</seg>
		<seg id="24">“I had never seen such a fluid procedure of loading of all my professional career”, he declared.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see squeakings of teeth and a brawl to burst with the door.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he added, “the passengers are assembled on board at the speed of the flash”.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also makes like Spirit and applies expenses of 2 $ for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier indicated that the passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can carry the nonopen quill with them, and those which have coffee can be been used again free.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It will always distribute water free.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways tried briefly to make pay for drinks in 2008 but returned behind seven months later after the passengers complained and whereas no other large airline company had followed.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The decision of Frontier to make pay expenses of hand luggage when the passengers directly do not buy their ticket near the airline company constitutes its last effort to encourage the customers to go on his site.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airline companies online pay to the salesmen travel like Orbitz 10 $ to 25 $ for each sold ticket.</seg>
		<seg id="33">That encouraged all the airline companies to encourage the passengers to buy directly near them instead of addressing itself at a travel agency online.</seg>
		<seg id="34">However, Frontier went further in this field.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, it started to offer only half of miles of fidelity to the customers who bought their ticket via a travel agency online.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Wednesday, it reduced the bonuses of miles of 25 % on a travel.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Thus, a travel Frontier de1 000 miles bought near a travel agency online would make it possible to gain 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">It also makes it possible to the passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they directly buy their ticket on the site of Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier has faithful customers in his town of origin, Denver, but its activity moves back and it loses money.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The receipts fell of 9 % and its capacity of flight decreased by almost 13 % during the first quarter, according to the financial results published Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic tried to rectify finances of Frontier by selling the airline company.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists have just clarified the way in which the movements of the tail of a dog are related to its mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Previous studies had revealed that the happy dogs more stirred up their tail towards the line (from the point of view of the dog), while the nervous dogs stirred up it more towards the left.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But from now on the scientists say that the dogs can detect these subtle differences and to answer it.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professeur Georgio Vallortigara, neuroscientifique of the university of Thirty, declared: “Everyone knows that, at the man, the left side and the right side of the brain are implied in a different way in the stimuli which wake up positive or negative emotions.”</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here, we tried to see what it was at other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that just as at the man, in the dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement towards the left and vice versa, and than the two hemispheres played a different part in the emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">More on the way in which the dogs react to the disordered movements of tail of other dogs, the researchers followed of the animals looking at films where appeared of other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It will surely not be necessary a long time before we understand why their tail goes sometimes on a side and sometimes from the other.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professeur Vallortigara explained: “We presented to dogs of the films where appeared of other dogs – either a version naturalist or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we could adulterate the movement of the tail and present it like energy on the left or on the right.”</seg>
		<seg id="10">When animals have seen dog without expression to stir up tail towards right-hand side (from the point of view of the dog which stirs up the tail), they remained perfectly slackened.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they have located tail to deviate mainly towards left (once again from the point of view of the dog which stirs up the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professeur Vallortigara said that he did not think that the dogs communicated deliberately between them thanks to these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He thinks rather than the dogs know by experiment the movements of which they would have or should not worry.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He added: “If you meet other dogs on several occasions and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail towards one on the east side associated with a friendlier attitude and that the right side involves a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experiment.”</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers indicate that the results could allow the owners, the veterinary surgeons and the tamers to better apprehend the emotions of their animals.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The expert in canine behavior John Bradshaw, professor invited to the School of sciences veterinary surgeons of the university of Bristol, specified that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right-hand side at the canine species.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a team of the university of Lincoln discovered that the dogs turned the head towards the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and towards the line when it was about a merry dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another scientific study carried out by the university of Victoria in Canada, he declared: “The dogs went more easily towards a dog robot when its tail stirred up towards the left rather than towards the line, instead of becoming anxious – the reverse of what appears in the Italian study.”</seg>
		<seg id="19">It indicated that the differences could come owing to the fact that the dogs having taken part in the various studies entirely did not regard the animals of the films or the dogs robots as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study on the way in which the dogs react vis-a-vis true dogs could be useful, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">“Although many elements, raised in various mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used at different ends, a good amount of details must still be specified – and the dogs do not make exception”, he declared.</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, being given the facility with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will surely not be necessary a long time before we understand why their tail moves sometimes on a side and sometimes of the other.</seg>

		<seg id="1">At the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys, 62% of the pupils have a mother tongue other than French.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It is what justified, one year ago, a consultation near the parents, pupils, professors and staff members of education, to think of the means of better integrating the pupils who live with horse between several cultures.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were going to pursue the rebels of M23 until in their bases located in the forests and the mountains of North-Kivu bordering on Rwanda and Uganda.</seg>
		<seg id="2">M23 appears about to be beaten after being driven out localities of the North-East of the Democratic republic of Congo (DRC) which it controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurrection.</seg>
		<seg id="3">“We will continue M23 and will drive back it everywhere where it hides because they are criminals”, declared at Reuters colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson of the FARDC.</seg>
		<seg id="4">We should not let them reorganize because they martyrize the Congolese people since too long.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Time had just brought back peace.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Persons in charge of M23 explained to have evacuated the localities under the diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political official of the rebellion, affirmed on RFI that these military setbacks would not modify of anything its claims with the peace talks.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The latter, according to the Ugandan mediators, began again Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and M23.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Fixings are announced in the hills which dominate Bunagana, the last locality with the hands of the insurrectionists to being fallen this week, like in the neighbourhoods of Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of M23 came out in 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="9">With their apogee in November, the insurrectionists occupied Gummed, chief town of the province of North-Kivu, benefitting from the escape of the governmental garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of Monusco.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The fall of Gummed brought the most important Mission of the United Nations in DRC, to the world in term of manpower, to reinforce its mandate and to form a fast brigade of made up intervention South-African soldiers, malawites and Tanzanians.</seg>
		<seg id="11">On his side, the staff of the FARDC was altered and the army passed to the offensive against M23, making change the course of the war.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The rhythm of progression of the governmental troops is today without precedent.</seg>
		<seg id="13">“M23 seems to touch at its end”, predicted an expert of the Congolese business, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It would be historical - it would be the first time that the government of Kinshasa succeeds in beating a major insurrection.</seg>
		<seg id="15">And it would be as the first time since 1996 as no armed group combined in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Experts of the United Nations show Rwanda, which denies it savagely, to militarily support M23, made up at the beginning of mutinous Congolese former servicemen.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The chief of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan president Paul Kagame to show reserve, announced a spokesperson of Foreign Office.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Last week, Kigali had evoked the possibility of military reprisals following the shells fallen in Rwandan territory.</seg>

		<seg id="0">John Kerry admitted, made without precedent, that American espionage “had gone too much far from inappropriate manner”</seg>
		<seg id="1">John Kerry indicated a rise in temperature of the defensive attitude of the United States with respect to his programmes of monitoring while admitting, made without precedent, that on several occasions, espionage “had gone too much far from inappropriate manner”.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Secretary of State also admitted that it had, just like Barack Obama, controlled on “autopilot” when a series of revelations flamers of the denouncer Edward Snowden about the activities of espionage of the NSA came out.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The escapes put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Expressing itself at the time of an intergovernmental conference in London by video connection, Mr. Kerry declared: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government became acquainted with certain things in autopilot mode because we had the possibility of it, as of the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold war, then of course September 11th.”</seg>
		<seg id="5">He became then the first member of high ranking of the government of the United States to admit that American espionage had exceeded the terminals, but insisted on the fact that the rights of each one had not been violated.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He declared: “In certain cases, it went too much far from inappropriate manner.”</seg>
		<seg id="7">And the President is determined to try to clarify and specify clearly with people who it proceeded now to a thorough re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels misled.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I ensure you that the innocent people will not be victims of abuse within the framework of this process.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr. Kerry insisted, however, on the fact that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its operations of monitoring had saved many lives.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to be made jump.”</seg>
		<seg id="11">There exists a radical extremism in the world which is given to try to kill out of people, to explode them and attack the governments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">And if you could intercept their communications and to stop them before they act?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings to explode and people to be assassinated because we could become acquainted with the facts in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, the American legislators will go to Europe to answer the concerns concerning the business of supposed American espionage and to convince Europeans of the need for continuing the joint efforts of fight against terrorism with the United States, explained Thursday the president of the subcommittee of the Senate on the European business.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that it had been expressed in front of the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that it was anxious threats which they had uttered concerning a possible withdrawal of the organizations anti-terrorists because of the feeling of frustration that the monitoring of the National Security Agency causes.</seg>
		<seg id="16">“It is really important for the protection of the national security in the United States which Europeans remain at our sides in the mutual obligation in the fight against terrorism”, declared Murphy, a democrat serving its first mandate, and chair subcommittee of the European business of the American Senate, during a maintenance from Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">And I will go to Europe for good to render comprehensible to them that we must continue to work together to fight against terrorism, in spite of the anger caused by the programs of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Press reports that the NSA collected million communications in Europe, which put at evil the relations with some combined of the United States, however the director of the agency declared this week that it was inaccurate and that it was about a misunderstanding because that related to metadata which the allies of NATO had collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Other revelations mentioned documents revealed by Snowden according to which the NSA had intercepted data and communications emanating of the mobile phone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other Heads of State.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The director of the intelligence services, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was about a common practice on the two sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy indicated that its office organized a travel of the Congress, which should take place this year, and which he hoped for that the delegation would understand of the members of the two parties and the two rooms.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The names of the other participating legislators should be revealed in the days to come.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It indicated that the route remained to be defined.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Murphy declared that the goal of this travel was to make it possible to improve the relations, but also to show “affectionate firmness”.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He explained why the European Heads of State were to be honest with their citizens about the type of programs of espionage which they apply themselves since years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">“We can modify our programs of monitoring in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must as understand as we are not in the world to only make espionage”, Murphy declared.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry envisaged to go this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to manage the rancour generated by the American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, like by the activities of monitoring of the United States.</seg>

		<seg id="0">For the chairman of Titan, “the project of purchase of Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employee”</seg>
		<seg id="1">After having thrown sponge with crash in January for the recovery partial of the Goodyear site of Amiens-North promised closing, to Maurice Taylor, the chairman of the American tire maker Titan, declares itself, today, ready to save 333 employment out of the 1,137 which account the factory.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for the productive rectification, had already announced it, Monday, October 21.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After having given up the project of purchase of the factory in January, you return today.</seg>
		<seg id="4">You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, while speaking about “so-called blue-collar workers”, who “work three hours” per day, of “insane” trade unions, by aiming at CGT.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This volte-face is not understood.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?</seg>
		<seg id="7">I do not try to please anybody.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Except with my wife.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial employment among best paid.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If I wounded somebody by my words, I am sorry.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But France has a high level of tax and unemployment too.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Does the truth wound you?</seg>
		<seg id="13">To work seven hours per day when in other countries one works eight hours handicaps France.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In India, China and in full with other countries, one works ten to twelve hours per day.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But I do not have prejudices on France.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What I see, it is a factory which manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to increase.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Why Titan does it need so much this factory?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Titan does not need to buy this factory.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But, with a correct price and qualified workers, that is worth the blow to test.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Which type of agreement do you wait between CGT and Goodyear?</seg>
		<seg id="21">If, since the announcement of the closing of the factory, Goodyear to the employees a good severance pay had offered, I think that 100% of the employees would have accepted it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Now, let us imagine that Titan buys in Goodyear the closed factory.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Consequently, Titan could move the machines towards Poland or any other country of the European Union which still has its own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I think that Mr. Montebourg knows that.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, he wants to keep the factory of Amiens with at least 333 well paid employment.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Titan agrees to recruit them among the few 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Also Mr. Montebourg needs it a commitment of Titan before trying to lead CGT to sit down with the table with Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The first stage is that CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on the severance pays for all the employees.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Consequently, there will be no more employees in the factory.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee this 333 employment during four years.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Do you confirm it?</seg>
		<seg id="32">The only number that I mentioned with the minister, it is 333.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I know that he would like a four years warranty.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But, as I told you, CGT and Goodyear must initially agree on severance pays.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If all the employees accept them, the project of purchase of the factory starts with zero employee.</seg>
		<seg id="36">How can we give guarantees of duration of employment when it does not remain more employees on the site?</seg>
		<seg id="37">If Mr. Montebourg arrives so that CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the factory, we intend well to remain in Amiens-North more than four years.</seg>

		<seg id="0">New request for collective appeal against the brothers Holy-Cross</seg>
		<seg id="1">A new request for collective appeal was presented against the brothers Holy-Cross, relating to sexual assaults which would have proceeded this time at the oratory Saint-Joseph like in several orphanages, colleges and schools.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified like “J.J”. , which would have been masturbated in the years 1950, initially with Our-Lady-of-Snows by its professor the Subjected brother, then by his confessor, the father Bernard, with the oratory Saint-Joseph, where it was being used as mass and where his/her father worked as painter.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The first recourse aimed only three establishments, and when the regulation was announced, much people told us: “me, was I at such place, I can be registered? ”, the lawyer Alain Arsenault tells, who defends the victims in both recourse.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The collective appeal which has just been deposited has as a characteristic to allow the addition of plaintiffs of any establishment where maltreatments could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Holy-Cross.</seg>
		<seg id="5">At present, the recourse joins together the complaints of 25 people who affirm to be attacked by the brothers Holy-Cross.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The pled facts are in general older than those mentioned in the first recourse, since several of the establishments concerned closed down in the years 1960.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The recourse underlines in addition that the congregation of Holy-Cross and the oratory Saint-Joseph, which is a distinct entity, “allowed that sexual maltreatments are perpetrated against children”, that they “exerted a moral constraint, religious and psychological on the victims”, that they “were with the current of the perpetrated sexual maltreatments and nevertheless choked them”, and that they “knowingly and consciously chose to be unaware of the problems”.</seg>
		<seg id="8">These last charges are based inter alia on letters written by lawyer of the brothers Holy-Cross, Me Émile Perrin, in the years 1990, but also by the research made in the archives on this subject by the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Holy-Cross which denounced the maltreatments publicly.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The collective appeal must initially pass the stage of the admissibility in Superior court.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Once the allowed admissibility by the Court, one proceeds at the second phase, that is to say hearings on the bottom.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The court blocks a decision relating to the policy of control and excavation of the NYPD</seg>
		<seg id="1">A federal Court of Appeal blocked Thursday the decision of a requiring judge of the changes in the checking routine and of excavation of the department of police of New York and dispossession of the file has it.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Court of Appeal of the United States (second circuit) indicated that the decision of judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the exit of the call lodged by the city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program aiming to control and question the citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city appealed against its conclusions and its corrective ordinances, in particular a decision aiming at allotting a controller to help the department of police to modify its policy and the training program which is associated for him.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Court of Appeal heard the arguments Tuesday relating to the request for suspension.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Court of Appeal declared that the judge was to be dispossession of the file because it infringed the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge for avoiding any appearance of partiality, partly because of a series of talks granted to the media and public statements in which it reacted publicly to criticisms of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge had ruled that the police officers wrongly violated the civil laws of tens of thousands of people by targeting black men and of Hispanic origin within the framework of their excavation and checking routine.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It appointed an external controller to supervise the modifications, in particular the reform of the policies, formation and supervision, and it ordered the installation of a pilot program to test cameras related to the body in the districts where more a large number of controls proceed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In August, the town of New York agreed to put an end to the practice consisting in preserving the names and addresses of the people whose case is rejected after police checks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The hearing of the call lodged by the city should take place after March 14th 2014.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The tactics of control and the excavation were criticized by many defenders of the civil laws.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This monitoring system and of excavation exists since decades in a certain form, but the number of recorded controls increased in a spectacular way under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach his more historical high level in 2011 with 684 330 controls which concerned mainly black men and of Hispanic origin.</seg>
		<seg id="13">A legal action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all coming from minorities, and was transformed into collective action.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The partisans preaching of the changes in and the excavation checking routine of the NYPD say that they will put an end to the unjust practices, will allow to have more effective contingents of police and to which one trusts, and will be able to change the way in which the departments of police use of the policy.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The opponents say that these changes would undermine the moral one of the police without cause a drop in the crime, would represent a money wasting and would not solve the broader problem of contingents of police under pressure after manpower of police officers were strongly reduced during the last decade.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The judge stressed that it did not put fine at the practices of control and excavation, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way in which the NYPD implemented its controls.</seg>

		<seg id="1">By a beautiful day of the end of August, a helicopter of the German police flew over at low altitude the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On order of the federal Office of protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national agency of information, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located at less than 5 km of the European Central bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The German media explain why BfV hoped to identify the presence of antennas of listening and that the operation caused an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Clapper, the director of the American intelligence services, insisted again in September on the fact that the United States does not use their capacities as regards foreign information “to steal the industrial secrecies of the foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their benefit”.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden, the consultant become denouncer, started to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrecies of the monitoring of the United States, the European governments and the managers of undertakings do not know any more if it is necessary to believe the director on word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports, according to which the National Security Agency American spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by American suppliers of services of storage in Cloud, in particular Google and Yahoo, more than ever caused the paranoia of the companies with regard to the monitoring of State.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The revelation according to which the telephone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel had been pirated, perhaps even during a decade, was the drop of water which made overflow the vase.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the most powerful person of Europe can be aimed, then the managers of undertaking are surely also potential targets.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden made transparent intensive collaboration between the American intelligence services and the companies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I estimate that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.</seg>
		<seg id="11">“Germany must awake”, declares Oliver Grün, president de BITMi, who represents German SME of the sector of TI.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The German companies think that the United States represents a risk as important as China when it is of industrial espionage and flight of data, according to an investigation published in July by consultancy EY.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However in all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, nothing states to date that the United States transmitted industrial secrecies of foreign companies to US companies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The politicians informed of their concern to the idea that the EU do not have data-processing capacities and Internet sufficient and think that it should endeavour to reduce her dependence with respect to the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The managers of undertaking are skepticals on this subject.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A deputy of the German Parliament said that we should create a Google German.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I can only close the eyes and slowly reopen them…</seg>
		<seg id="18">“It is not the good way of making”, indicates Hasso Plattner, president of the software company of German company, SAP.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If one wanted an industry European of TI strong, then one did not have to let it die 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="20">All is subsidized in Germany, of coal to the cars, via the farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">All except the industry of TI.</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, the extent and the sophistication of the American agencies of espionage exposed by the revelations of Snowden were a shock for certain companies which thought hitherto that China represented the largest risk in terms of monitoring.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A large change is occurring in data processing in cloud since the European persons in charge became aware owing to the fact that the data preserved at the United States are controls under the terms of the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to a survey conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, a professional body, some 10 % of the nonAmerican members gave up their projects to use an American supplier of services of storage in the cloud after the revelations on the American programme of exploration of the PRISM data.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Jim Snabe, deputy manager of SAP, declares: “Our customers put a question today to us that they did not pose to us one year ago: where my data are preserved and can you guarantee to me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many German leaders indicate that the last reports are only one confirmation of what they knew already, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most invaluable secrecies and that these data must consequently be kept at all costs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.</seg>
		<seg id="28">There always was of it.</seg>
		<seg id="29">“It is a recurring subject since many years and nothing basically changed within the framework of the current discussion”, declares Kurt Glass of bier, chief executive officer of the film company of chemical products BASF.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The Americans spy on us on the commercial plan and industrialist just like let us spy on we them, because it is in the national interest defend our companies.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The managers of undertaking are generally not very inclined to reveal the preventive measures which they installation, if that would leave the advantage to an adversary.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The large companies for a long time hammer the message according to which it is at the very least imprudent to recover a free USB key at the time of a trade show or to leave a laptop without monitoring in a hotel room.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the Audi car manufacturer, declares that the collection of the mobile phones before the meetings of the council, so that they cannot be used like devices of remote listening, is a common practice since years.</seg>
		<seg id="34">BfV of Germany advises with its leaders to plan to use simple mobile phones prepaid at the time of their travel abroad because of the risk of attack to the integrity of the smartphones.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The prepaid mobile phones are then thrown.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, it is feared that the small and medium-size companies remain vulnerable to the hacking and the monitoring.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Germany, a good amount of SME are world leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
		<seg id="38">“SME often miss experiment, of staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrecies against an unauthorized access”, BfV in a report informs.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The United States alerts their own companies on the economic activities of espionage carried out by other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The National Estimate Intelligence (DENIES) carried out in February by the United States, quoted France, just as Russia and Israel, culprits with the second degree to have carried out acts of hacking of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Treasury quantified temporarily the measurement of the tax on the capital gains but expects a definite decision of Mr. Osborne which, in the budget of 2012, registered an excise tax of 7 % for the properties costing more than 2 M£ and of the annual expenses for the purchasers who choose to rather hold properties within the framework of a company than to in an individual capacity.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The excise tax applies already to the residential properties of the districts of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea, and accounts for 708 M£ on the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the full amount of Northern Ireland, of Wales, of Scotland, of the North-East, the North-West and the region joined together Yorkshire terrier and Humber.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The work completed by HS2 Ltd lets think that the services at high speed until Scotland and the north of England will start as of the phase cut-off 1 in 2026.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Minister for Transport baroness Kramer declared that the project “would gather the United Kingdom”.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Scottish Minister for Transport, Keith Brown said himself “excited” to the idea to work with the British government on the project.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Phase 1 will relate to a railway new line at high speed between London and West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In June, the government re-examined upwards the estimated cost of the construction of the connection at high speed between London and the north of England, passing from 32.7 Md£ with 42.6 Md£.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The British government, which is in talks with Scotland Transport, asked HS2 Ltd to study the reinforcement of the railway capacity and the improvement of the journey time for the north of England and Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">That must include the possibility of durations of travel between Glasgow and three hour old Edinburgh at the maximum.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The baroness Kramer declared: “Our objective for HS2 relates to a truly national network which will bring closer the United Kingdom and its cities.”</seg>
		<seg id="10">We push project HS2 because the advantages which he has are enormous.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Without him, we are confronted with a problem of capacity of our railway network.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 British big cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: “The announcement of today is a good news for Scotland.”</seg>
		<seg id="14">For the Scottish government, Keith Brown invited Mr. Carmichael to support “unambiguous” the inclusion of Scotland in network HS2.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Brown declared: “The train at high speed has the potential to offer considerable economic advantages to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the global project of railway network at high speed in all Great Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="16">“We are thus excited with the idea to work in partnership with the British government in order to examine the options aiming at bringing the network of train at high speed as far as Scotland, creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish government is already planning.</seg>
		<seg id="17">“I am impatient of reading the report of examination with the British ministers the next year and we will then decide together forthcoming stages.”</seg>

		<seg id="0">The parents of intersexués children can choose “unspecified sex”</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for the infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The male sex or female of new born will be allotted to them more, in a rigid way, with the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Within the framework of the new law, the parents will not be held any more to declare the sex of their child, authorizing them to register an “unspecified” sex or “not specified” on its certificate of birth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The goal of the law was to remove the pressure which weighed on the shoulders of the parents who could make decisions precipitated concerning a surgery of sexual reassignment for their infant, and to fight against discrimination in the opposition as of intersexuées people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the BBC, a intersexuée person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain the patchwork which the doctors created, contused and slashed.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is estimated that a child on 2 000 born each year, is neither a boy nor a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are intersexués, intersexuality belonging to the group of about sixty diseases diagnosed like disorders the sexual development, a generic term nominating the persons having of the chromosomes or the gonads (ovaries or testicles) atypical or of the abnormally developed sexual organs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson could have been intersexuée.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The sexual identification still is not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when the sex cannot be given, it is better to use best information available to allot it, then to expect and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiatrist in New York and specialist in the questions of sexual identification, declared that the new German law “seems to be a good idea”.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The intersexués children pose an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">“Certain people suffer from extremely serious diseases which require a surgical act, but it is not the case of the majority of the children”, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and to see how the identity develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science which consists in knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nobody can answer the question of knowing why that occurs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is as the mystery which surrounds the homosexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Report subjected to European Commission in 2011 described people intersexuées like different from people transsexuals or transgenres, since their statute is not related to the sex but rather with their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is in general two at the same time and not the clearly defined one as being one or the other.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics can appear themselves in the secondary sexual characters, (as the muscular mass, pilosity, the chest and the stature), the sexual characters primary education (like the reproductive bodies and the sexual organs) or the structure of the chromosomes and the hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gave an outline of discrimination with which were confronted the intersexuées people and transgenres as regards employment, as well as the extent of the acts of harassing and violence and of the crimes moved by prejudices.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The young boys of kind not-in conformity have from now on camps which are especially intended to them.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal authorize already the adults to register male sex, female or “third sex” on their official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, Australian 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, became the first nobody in the “neutral” world to be recognized after having gained its appeal which authorizes it to keep a sex “not specified” with life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The German passports will comprise the third designation beside M or F – X for intersexué, according to the ministry for the Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In close France, the questions of kind always are the object of controversies, according to a report diffused on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozen legislators of this fundamentally catholic country signed a petition so that the “theory of the kinds” is withdrawn from the schoolbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The American site Catholic Online was also opposed to the German law, writing that “since the world is trailed in a new reign where the kind is a choice but where the sexual activity is not one, one reverses two other pillars of the civilisation.”</seg>
		<seg id="28">In Maryland, the mother of an infant also declared on Baby Zones that she would prefer that a sex is allotted to the babies with their birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">“The role of relative is sufficiently stressing without additional restrictions, in particular if you do not know the sex of your child”, she declared on the site intended for the young parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The children need stability and certainty.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, the newborns without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the splendid Greek god who had a double sex.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And hardly about ten years ago, the medical community regarded the kind as a slate, which one can delete and on which one can redraw.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But from now on, many which is those call into question the ethical base of the surgery, knowing that the sexual identity is complex and that sometimes the doctors can be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when it grows.</seg>
		<seg id="34">“In the middle of 20th century, one called that a psychiatric urgency”, Drescher indicated.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When these children were born, one did not call the psychiatrist, one telephoned the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The dominant theory on the way of treating the children equipped with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, of the Johns-Hopkins university, which considered that the kind is malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It devoted the term “identity sexual” and supported that the social and environmental signals – the way in which the parents raise a child – interact with genes and the hormones of a child to work it so that it is identified as being of male sex or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in a case of 1966, known under the name of “John/Joan”, his theories caused controversies.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He had advised with the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut at the time of a circumcision skimped on to make it entirely castrate, by also removing the testicles to him, and to raise it like a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">“Money presented that like a successful case of transition, but it was not the case”, Drescher declared.</seg>
		<seg id="41">At the age of approximately 15 years, it is become again a boy and married with a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But at 38 years, it committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher declared that certain doctors “always repeat this model”.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the years 1990, with the arrival of Internet, those which survived these operations of change of sex say “[that] they are not satisfied with the result”.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36 year old writer of Montana, which was born with male chromosomes XY but from the ambiguous sexual organs.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The doctors could not really say if it had a broad clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that it could not never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Thus little time after its birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical ablation of the external body and testicles and was high like a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One made him take female hormones at the 12 years age.</seg>
		<seg id="49">“I knew that I was not a girl”, he declared on ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At 18 years, it underwent a vaginoplastie.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But depressed and realizing that something did not go, he asked his medical record.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he discovered it horrified.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized with the birth – and nobody had never told me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a disorder from the sexual development (DDS) which prevented its body from producing sufficient testosterone so that its sexual organs can develop.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After having learned the truth, it is become again a man, while following a treatment to testosterone and was made remove the centres.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The surgery made it sterile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, it defends the cause of the others in an organization called Project Interface, which tries to standardize the perception of the intersexuées people.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, chief executive officer of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law “invites to labelling and stigmatization”.</seg>
		<seg id="60">“Many activists worry that the German law encourages the parents to make fast decisions and give to their child “an unspecified” sex”, she declared.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid which she encourages the interventions.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think that it would be to better allot a male sex or female, and to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we did not see what the law was going to give, therefore we can only advance assumptions.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis declared that its organization supported the Australian law because “it authorizes the adults to be chosen to be recognized under name third sex”.</seg>
		<seg id="65">“The adults should be able to make up their own minds in connection with a legal kind”, she added.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law relates to the attribution of the sex to the birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">It is not a battle which the young children should lead to this age.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow, they will be able to make decisions concerning their own body.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, radiologist specialized in the mammographies with Pittsburgh, whose girl is reached of a disorder of the sexual development and who helps of the thousands of people in a group of support, declared that the German law “will give a sense of responsibility” the parents and the children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">The girl of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called syndrome of complete insensitivity to the androgens.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because of the failure of his receivers of androgens, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">It has a vagina, but not uterus nor of ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Today 29 years old, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the university of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Although it is sterile, it hopes to have children through services of adoption or surrogate mothers.</seg>
		<seg id="75">“The law leaves a certain latitude to the parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions”, Baratz declared.</seg>
		<seg id="76">That leaves them time to make certain tests and to understand them, and a time before registering “male” or “female”.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Thus, all is well – you can raise your child and like it.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a splendid baby and benefit from the pleasure of being relative.</seg>
		<seg id="79">You do not have to precipitate you for a surgical operation which is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">“That puts the children in the middle of the decision and attenuates the feeling of anxiety which motivates the parents because they are afraid not to do what it is necessary”, she declared.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Lastly, the child will decide with which sex il/elle le/la at ease feels more – and it is something of formidable.</seg>
		<seg id="82">That authorizes the child to make the decision for itself.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I voted twice for president Obama, believing in the possibility of a change</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says that Obama made creditable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the Republican party</seg>
		<seg id="3">Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the attacks of drones</seg>
		<seg id="4">The report of marketing year 2008 of Obama is a sad recall what could have done without</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is student in 2nd year of medicine at the Medical college of Harvard.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I am reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a book which, I thought, would encourage to me during the moroseness of the 2nd year of medicine and hope would give again me.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called “The Audacity to Windows” and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I finished the medical reports of my patients the evening and that I lie down, this book takes back me at the time where the policies inspired by the million people and where the speeches could cut you the breath.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election ended in a crushing victory and the presenters of the newspapers of news took the time to think of the historical nature of the moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My comrades cried of joy and my parents preserved all the newspapers which they found.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionaries advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for the change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During the period of transition of Obama before her taking of in 2008, it had 82 % of favorable opinions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The return to the present is a difficult alarm clock, it is like leaving one dreamed.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is difficult to remember these days full with optimism, it are like remote memories, a sad recall of the appropriatenesses of the past.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The change really occurred in the years which followed the first time where I voted.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I put at the credit of Obama of great achievements, since the passage of Affordable Care Act (law on the accessible care) until the departure of Iraq of our army, via the end of “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Oussama ben Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, I believe that obstructionism in favour destroyed too many efforts aiming at advancing our nation in the field of the reforms of immigration, the public health care and the closing of Guantanamo, inter alia things.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after defendhaving many times defended the administration of Obama vis-a-vis my pars and my colleagues, I do not manage any more to provide explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I am at the edge of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The republican obstruction cannot explain the setting on listening of the foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of the Americans, nor the committal for trial of the denouncers who reveal the misdeeds of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without lawsuit, nor the escape from public finances and the going beyond the expenditure authorized during the presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media to silence are “the more aggressive… since the administration of Nixon”.</seg>
		<seg id="27">And, more recently, it cannot excuse impossibility of conceiving a simple website during more than three years after the law on Affordable Care Act was ratified.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know if it is it what I expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If, at 18 years, I were supposed to understand that the governance could contradict the political campaigns which precede it.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Obviously, the electoral function is not foreseeable, because the political party of opposition and the events which occur by chance, as the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However, all the examples which I indexed above seem to be mainly the choice of the administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">It is what disturbs me more.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was filled with enthusiasm by his candidature.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney presented a confused and little refined alternative which did not seem to make it possible to determine its policies or its positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I felt that Obama, elected for a second mandate while being released of the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises about which one intended to speak since so a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, whereas the index of favorable opinions plunged under 45 % this week, it is even more difficult to return at the year 2008 through this book.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me wish the many promises which flew away.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week, I read the part of the book which describes how Obama underwent enormous losses with the profit of Clinton to the Primary educations of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At a meeting of after-countryside, he said to his team that it was necessary that they go back on the right track and remain faithful to their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">“I want that we centre ourselves on our talent”, he declared.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We must remember who we are.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Us here 5 years afterwards, Mr. President, and I am not any more agreement with you.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The points of view expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders of its division foreign exchange market according to two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the world investigation of the regulators into suspicions of handling of the foreign exchange market starts to bear fruit.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Some of the more large banks in the world, in particular UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with the regulators within the framework as of investigations conducted into the most important financial market to the world, where 5.3 billions of US dollars change hand each day.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Both traders are the first employees of RBS to being suspended within the framework of the widening of the investigation which echoes the scandal of handling of interbank rate LIBOR.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month to have received information requests on behalf of the regulators.</seg>
		<seg id="5">“The investigation in progress into this business continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators”, a representative of the bank declared two weeks ago.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Last month, of the sources close to the file declared that RBS had transmitted files of e-mails and instantaneous messages, sent to and by old a trader, with the British regulator, Financial Conduct Authority.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been put suspended of its station of European person in charge of the trading at the cash for the currencies at JPMorgan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Rohan Ramchandani, person in charge European of the trading of exchange the cash at ISIC, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, trader senior of currencies at Barclays and UBS, were suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
		<seg id="9">None of these traders was the object of any charge.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The file of Mr. Usher understood instantaneous messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.</seg>
		<seg id="11">UBS explained this week that she had brought an action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, declared that he inquired into suspicions of handling of the foreign exchange market in a certain number of Swiss banks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the world, at least six authorities – European Commission, Finma, authority of Swiss competition Weko, the FCA, the American Department of justice and Monetary authority of Hong Kong – examine the allegations made concerning bankers who would have intended themselves to handle the rates on the foreign exchange market.</seg>

		<seg id="14">The banks peel the instantaneous messages and the e-mails sent since of the years to find cases of acts reprehensible.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The news concerning these investigations shook the traders in a sector which was one of the largest engines of growth of the units of trading of the investment banks during last years, but which was called into question this year because of the low volatility of the currencies which limits opportunities for the speculators.</seg>

		<seg id="1">“Inside Llewyn Davis” of the brothers Coen, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music which just started to resound there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Joel and Ethan Coen, from which the catalogue of films comes to be the object of a retrospective to the French Cineclub, had nicked the gold Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the absence of being able to engage Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their reserved on rising star of the American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years, but also on the planetary star pop Justin Timberlake.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In this stuffed film of humour where the music is a central figure and the songs interpreted live, Oscar Isaac appears a musician and singer of folk achieved, while Timberlake, his/her friend in the film, leaves the pop one for the folk music with a contagious jubilation.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As for Carey Mulligan, it left the rich attire of Daisy Mulligan in “Gatsby the splendid one” for clothing less reluisants, a soft voice when it sings, but the swearword output with the machine-gun when it speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="6">“Inside Llewyn Davis” tells over one week the tribulations of a singer of folk who does not manage to bore and is annoyed with the whole ground.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It accepts with move back the replacements with the foot raised in the studios.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Without housing, he does the rounds of the settees of his friends who want to still receive it.</seg>
		<seg id="9">An air of documentary</seg>
		<seg id="10">“Its relationship to success is tortured, it is that which interested us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the good moment, which is not careerist but integrates, with a self-destroying behavior”, declared with the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and price in Cannes.</seg>
		<seg id="11">If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two scenario writers fans of folk music built their history on true personalities of the time like the folk musician Dave Von Ronk.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The idea was to show the moment preceding the advent by Greenwich village, this district of New York called to become “the epicentre of the rise of the folk music which would generate stars international” like writes it the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The film takes on an air of documentary then, label of dusty music invaded of 33T unsold inhabited by an old invaluable secretary, with the musical choices of the studios of the time and with the coffees where the singers occurred.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating funny of character who crosses the film permanently: a splendid russet-red cat with the cracking glance, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Questioned on the way in which it composed its character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled “to have grown in Tennessee, to have bathed by the blues and the country”.</seg>
		<seg id="16">“My first lessons of music were taught to me by my grandfather who learned how to me to play of the guitar”, he had added.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary “to be regarded as good”, “the chance can also launch the career of somebody”, and “more and more today”.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Comme Llewyn Davis who refuses very compromised on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, “most important is not to let itself wedge by all that can prevent us from expressing us”.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Espionage of the NSA: the United States “went too much far”, Kerry admits</seg>
		<seg id="1">The United States sometimes went “too far” as regards espionage, recognized the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first consent of Washington in full polemic with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National agency of security (NSA).</seg>
		<seg id="2">After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the European United States and their allies, it is the first time that an American governmental leader explicitly admits practices discussed in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="3">“In certain cases, I concede it to you, like made the president, some of these actions went too far and we will make sure that does not arrive in the future any more”, John Kerry at the time of a conference in London declared in which he took part from Washington Thursday, October 31 by video connection.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In his broadcast intervention, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the chief of the American diplomacy lengthily justified the practices of information and collection of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention against possible attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Calling upon the attacks of September 11th, 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry ensured that the American authorities since had thwarted many projects of attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.</seg>
		<seg id="6">“We have in prevented fact that planes do not fall, that buildings do not explode and that people are assassinated, because we were able to be with the current upstream of these projects”, the owner of the American diplomacy argued.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And, John Kerry intended for Europeans, “I affirmed ensure you that in this process of the innocent people were not misled”.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But we endeavour to gather information.</seg>
		<seg id="9">“And yes, in certain cases, it went too much far from inappropriate manner”, still the Secretary of State admitted, which had already had to be described on this international scandal at the time of a round last week in Paris, London and Rome.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It ensured Thursday evening that president Obama “was determined to try to clarify and that it proceeded to a re-examination of these practices so that nobody feels misled”.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data of hundreds of million users of Google and Yahoo.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained from the ex-consultant of the NSA Edward Snowden, affirms that the program baptized “MUSCULAR”, and carried out with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, makes it possible these two agencies to recover data since optical fibers used by the giants of Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="14">With believing one of the documents of them, some 181 million elements had been collected during the only month of last January - energy of metadata on e-mail, with elements of text or audio or video documents.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These interceptions would take place apart from the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Yahoo and Google denied any link with these practices.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For ten days, several large newspapers in France, in Germany, in Spain or Italy, have revealed that the NSA would massively have intercepted data and communications emanating of combined of the United States and their leaders, in particular the German chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Vis-a-vis the anger of European States and whereas escapes in the American press affirmed that the US president was not with the current of such listenings, Barack Obama refused to be expressed on this subject, calling upon the national security.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On the other hand, the owner of powerful the NSA, the general Keith Alexander, contradicted to him that its information agency collected tens of million communications of European citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It even returned the ball to the European intelligence services which would have seized themselves of these communications, before providing them to the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="21">That would relate to “military operations” in countries where these allies of NATO cooperate with the United States and that would absolutely not aim Europe, affirmed the Alexander general.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And the polemic extended Friday in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Indonesia convened the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is shown to be used by the Americans within the framework of a vast international spy network which also caused the anger of China.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: To age earlier</seg>
		<seg id="1">Studies show that the young girls Afro-Americans and Hispanic tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than the white young girls.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent</seg>
		<seg id="3">Nothing proves that the hormones or that other chemical substances are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">The experts think that the epidemic of obesity could be a release of early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend towards an early puberty is not also marked among boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialized journalist in the family questions and of health in the child.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Does a mother have to worry if the centres and the pubic hairs of his/her daughter start to push to 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the time of the annual conference of American Academy of Pediatrics which was held this week in Orlando, in Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are rather current among the American young people and represent a new standard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">“I spend much time to reassure the parents – in general, that does not indicate a quick change towards full puberty”, Kaplowitz declared.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The obvious signs of development, such as the budding of the centres, the hairs under the arms and in the pubic zone and the body odors, appear earlier in the girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there was only one light advanced of the age of the first rules during four last decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the median age is of 12 years and half, whereas it was 12 years three quarters in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">“Once the chest started to develop, one needs at least two or three years before the first rules appear”, indicated Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guides to Coping with This Common Problem”.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most precise test to know how puberty will evolve.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is a debate concerning what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but she is regarded as “early” when the development of the chest is accompanied by a sudden growth before the 8 years age.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most case, the development slows down or stops – it is something which a pediatrist can follow closely.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by a endocrinologist to draw aside from the serious problems like tumours or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There exist treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences: a premature ageing of the bones which can slow down the growth and a small at the adulthood.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations as regards medicamentous and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is careful with the drugs but recognizes that “the fact of controlling puberty can attenuate certain problems of behavior and the feeling for the young girls to be different from different”.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other major problem is comprehensible: The parents do not want quite simply that their very young girls have their rules.</seg>
		<seg id="23">“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they will manage the questions of hygiene”, Kaplowitz declared.</seg>
		<seg id="24">“That was a shock”, remembers a woman whose girl had her first rules at 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even if there were signs and that we had spoken about the rules, it was not prepared emotionally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It returned from the school frightened and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There exist many theories made available of the public on the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">However, there is no coherent theory according to which the hormones contained in milk or other food, the chemical products present in the environment or the sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The boys, like the girls, reach their puberty earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz affirms that the most credible assumption is that of the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It took part in a study conducted on old girls from 6 to 9 years which binds the percentage of fatty mass to the release of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Others discovered support this conclusion, but there exist many other influential factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, the young girls Afro-Americans and Hispanic tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than the white young girls.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There exist various explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">On a worldwide scale, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by all, of the economic conditions to the climate, via genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another problem: Although the boys have hairs on the face and in the pubic zone young people, the trend towards a true early puberty is not as marked as in the girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors taking part in the conference of the AAP insisted on the complexity of the subject.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of the acne and the pubic hairs is current, even in the infants and the toddlers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">“We must be careful as for the way in which we identify the true appearance of puberty”, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at the hospital for Goryeb children in Morristown, in the New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The parents should not hesitate to request council from their pediatrist to know how to speak with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">“That can mean to have a conversation earlier than envisaged”, explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you remain calm, your child will react well in general.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The girls whose puberty is early must be reassured on the fact that, even when that arrives earlier than provided, the process is part of the life.</seg>

		<seg id="43">Begin then a kind of readjustment with the life, very gently, for one or two months which is a little like vacancies.</seg>
		<seg id="44">How did the medical examinations and debriefing DGSE occur?</seg>
		<seg id="45">I had been entitled to the first medical control in Corsica.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The rest was made with the Valley-of-Grace the following days my return: radios, examinations in all kinds and meets with a psychiatrist.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It is not a meeting which does all but one can that one can count on him, recall it if need be, that one is not delivered to ourselves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">That been part of the procedure.</seg>

		<seg id="50">They put to me questions about the takers of hostages.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It was logical.</seg>
		<seg id="52">That did not obstruct me.</seg>
		<seg id="53">How do you react, today, with the release of the four hostages of Niger?</seg>
		<seg id="54">I listen what is said.</seg>
		<seg id="55">The debate on the ransoms in particular.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Certain things irritate me, others less.</seg>
		<seg id="57">I try to make allowances between the questions about my past as an hostage and a my cap of president of association “Hostages of the world” which enables me to put distance, and seems much more interesting to me to approach.</seg>
		<seg id="58">I wonder for example about the definition of impact strength.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Especially, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.</seg>
		<seg id="60">There is in my opinion a problem of semantics.</seg>
		<seg id="61">It is necessary to qualify the taking of hostages of “political” taking of hostages - what is the case most of the time - and to make it possible to the hostages to have access to justice, to carry felt sorry for and to bring their takers of hostages before the International Criminal Court.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Today, once more, everyone is in the compassion, the emotion, and is delighted by the release of these hostages.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But which says that these hostages could perhaps have also access to justice?</seg>
		<seg id="64">A court in The Hague east made for that.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Why wouldn't one say to the takers of hostages “you ridiculed the rules of the war, like those of all Geneva Conventions, one will bring you in justice”?</seg>
		<seg id="66">That however seems to me founded, legitimates, struck good sense.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This message is heard, but is not listened, and that shocks me.</seg>
		<seg id="68">It is my principal combat.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: The bursting of Europe gives the choice to the Scot</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another worrying history of independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, us are warned that independent Scotland would be held to join the European zone of freedom of movement to be able to adhere to the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">And here that one hears stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed sons along the Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
		<seg id="4">If it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde indicated the possible economic consequences of a greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, that however did not appear in the headlines (and it was to be envisaged).</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nobody either said that the Member States of the EU devote most of their time to circumvent their formal rules when that arranges them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Since Scotland is not part of Schengen space for the moment, a continuous non-observance of the rules would be a mean concession that Brussels could offer whole on the other hand that she wants to obtain from the Scot.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is thus about a history which is not one.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And a history so old that it is now fixed: I heard for the first time the tall story according to which “independence means the passport control” there is more than 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">However, one forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why independent Scotland should follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why exchange the yoke of London against that of Brussels, in particular now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here true news concerning Europe: the great plan of post-war period aiming at unifying Europe is definitively at the dead point.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the crisis of the euro, the Europe Project officially died.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Through Europe, the parties which oppose to the EU or which militate for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency, gain ground.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the party Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, only founded this year and arrived of nowhere, gathered almost five million voice at the time as of federal elections of September and left the democratic Liberal party (equivalent of our liberal-democrats) the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There always was a national opposition to the creation project of federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, the current economic crisis marked a turning.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central bank, associated with the heavy yoke on the national economies via adhesion with the single currency, led many people to think that the Europe Project went too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the euro does not have large-thing to see with the national governments which record excessive budget deficits – that was only true for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The European system rather made weigh on its members of exchange rates favorable to the German exporters – what the German politicians want to preserve.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of Europe of the south are found with an intrinsic problem of productivity with respect to Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only recourse is to make dark cuts in the wages and the public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Beyond the budgetary and monetary problems current, there exists a major discomfort related to the productivity in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize the French companies and German of the energy sector to the expenses of the consumer – European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for gas that the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It is about a crippling disadvantage in terms of costs, as we already saw in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All the gel of wages in the world will not prevent European petrochemical industry from being penalized by a cheap American schist gas.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Consequently, the revolt thunders, in particular in France, one of the large leaders of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a means of controlling Germany and of putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin does not need more Paris like passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy put at evil to thrash about.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result: the party of far right of Marine Le Pen, Front National anti-European, has just gained a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists with the power in the third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Front National is from now on the most popular party in France with 24 % of the votes – a convenient warning for the British Workers party which reminds to him that it cannot leave the principle which a scission of the right-hand side will support automatically the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Marine Le Pen with her new popularity near the French white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to make use of the European elections of the next year to create a single block anti-currency and anti-European within the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the parties anti-Europeans make good figure with these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here what I think: very soon, the feeling anti-European and single anti-currency in Europe will unify and will end up killing the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something which will resemble more “Europe of the Nations (sovereign)” free privileged by the General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and some of its satellite economies could preserve the euro, but France and Europe of the south will find their own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that the United Kingdom keeps its distance compared to this project, and I hope that it will make the soft eyes in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, the interest growing of Washington for the Pacific lets think that Great Britain will be rejected in the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">And Scotland, in all that?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can decide to be an area of small England (primarily).</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our economic own interests, which includes to send packing Berlin and Brussels.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I believe that Scotland could put up with a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The co-operation with the other countries with the similar sights would be easier in nonfederal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">If not, we should imitate Norway and preserve our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The government SNP of Scotland east – and it is to be noted – the political movement anti-austerity which best succeeded in Europe, since it gained a spectacular majority in 2011 founded over its opposition to the cuts dark suggested (and put in work) by the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the coalition conservatives/liberal-democrats who followed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous maintaining for Scotland to vote for independence if is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="8">They seek how, during the next decade, they will be able to pass to a system making it possible the drivers to pay according to the number of traversed miles.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a monitoring system by GPS, for one transferred experimental.</seg>
		<seg id="10">That is really essential for our nation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">“It is not as if we had the choice”, declared Hassan Ikhrata, chief executive officer of Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the State starts to record the miles traversed by each Californian motorist by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be change in the way in which we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Technology is there to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The pressure comes owing to the fact that the Highway Fund Trust of the country, financed with the taxes which the Americans pay with the pump, is financially dry.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Americans buy as much of petrol only front.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The cars can traverse more miles with one gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax itself, which is of 18.4 hundreds per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The politicians are reticent to increase the tax, even of 1 hundred, whereas the prices of the petrol are high.</seg>
		<seg id="19">“The tax on the petrol is quite simply not bearable”, declared Lee Munich, a specialist in the policies of transport at the university of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Its State recently made install tracers on 500 cars to test a system of payment with the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="21">“That proves to be the most logical alternative in the long run”, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Wonks calls that of the expenses of use to mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is not surprising that the idea allures the town liberals, since the taxes could be used to modify the practices of control so as to make it possible to reduce the obstructions and the gas emissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The planners of California are interested in the system since they work out strategies to reach the objectives set in the ambitious laws of the State on climate warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), president of the Committee of transport of the House of Representatives, declared that he also regarded it as the most viable alternative in the long run.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The partisans of the open market of the Reason foundation also appreciate the idea to make pay the drivers with the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">“It is not simply about a tax engulfing itself in a large black hole”, Adrian Moore, vice-president of the policy to the Reason foundation declared.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People pay more directly for the advantages which are gotten to them.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also supported by two former American secretaries with Transport which, in a ratio of 2011, exhorted the Congress with going in the way of the payment to the mile.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The American Senate approved a pilot project of 90 M$ last year which would have related to approximately 10 000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the presidency of the Room killed the proposal, answering the concerns of the rural legislators representing of the voters who must traverse many miles the every day to go to their work or downtown.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several States and big cities make nevertheless progress on their side.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Given is Oregon, which mobilized 5 000 drivers to undertake the most important experiment of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These motorists will pay soon in the State of the kilometric expenses instead of the taxation of the petrol.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada already carried out a pilot project in the long term.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The town of New York considers one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95 coalition, which understands 17 agencies implied in road transport in States skirting on the east side American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies how it could implement the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal success.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where approximately 50 voluntary motorists recently equipped their car with a device, the drivers were anxious that the government can follow their the least action.</seg>
		<seg id="41">“Concerns about Big Brother and this kind of things are a big problem”, Alauddin Khan declared, which directs the strategic management of the performance to the department of Transport of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It is not something which people want.</seg>
		<seg id="43">At the beginning of the test, the ACLU of Nevada informed on its site: “It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into devices of localization except for whole.”</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is not necessary to build an enormous and cumbersome technological infrastructure which will be inevitably widened to preserve the recordings of the daily comings and goings of people.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is part of some States which thrash about from now on to find a technology accessible which would make it possible at the State to know how much miles traverses a car, but without knowing the place nor the hour exact.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If one can do that, added Khan, the citizens will be more at ease.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The search for this technology led certain agencies of State to call on small a start-up of California of the name of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">At the origin, the company was not intended to help the motorists who pay taxes in the States.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She sought to bore in the emerging market of the car insurance, in which the drivers would pay according to their mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But which it tests the planners of the main roads liked the devices because they do not use GPS and provide a limited quantity of information, downloaded periodically by modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">“People will be more inclined to do that if you do not record their speed and do not locate them”, Ryan Morrison, chief executive officer of True Mileage declared.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Large mistakes were made in the pilot programs of certain States.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There exist average much cheaper and methods much intrusive to proceed.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, the planners try the experiment by offering to the motorists various choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">They can still choose not to have a device of the whole, preferring in the place to pay a fixed price based on the median number of miles traversed by all the residents of the State.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Other States hope to sell the concept to citizens being wary while allowing the devices to make some more, rather than not enough.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In the town of New York, the persons in charge of transport seek to develop a device of taxation which would be also equipped to pay the expenses of parking, to provide an insurance “payment to control” and to create a set of data on speed in real time coming from the other drivers that the motorists could use to avoid the congestions.</seg>
		<seg id="59">“The motorists would be incited to take part because as of advantages that the system their offer”, a document indicated on the urban development.</seg>
		<seg id="60">However, certain planners of transport wonder whether all the debate on the payment with the mile is not simply an enormous diversion.</seg>
		<seg id="61">To Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the zone of bay of San Francisco, the persons in charge say that the Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Fund Trust by increasing the taxation of the petrol.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Single or renewal fees additional could be imposed on the drivers of hybrid vehicles and others of which the vehicles do not consume much petrol, so that each one pays its right share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">“It is not necessary to resort to a radical surgery when one quite simply needs aspirine”, declared Randy Rentschler, the director of the legislation and the public affairs attached to the commission.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If that is done, about the hundreds of million motorists will worry about the protection of their private life and a lot of other things.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world containing jellyfish.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Charlie Francis benefitted from the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent collation.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It had the idea of it after having read a study on the jellyfishes and convinced of the Chinese scientists to recreate brilliant protein chemically.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the pH of protein to make it shine.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Chris explains that, since the ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, more one licks, more it becomes brilliant.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Charlie, the founder of the company of ices “Lick Me I' m Delicious”, declared: “It is something of incredible but let us be we yet only at the beginnings in terms of production, and 2 G of this trick cost approximately 200 £.”</seg>
		<seg id="7">The protein that we use in the ice reacts with the language to neutral pH.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Thus when your mouth heats protein, the level of pH increases and the ice starts to shine.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We tested it during last months and it seemed convenient to share it with all at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is probably the most expensive ice which I created because the luminescence of the jellyfishes is worth four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Each ball thus costs me approximately 140 £.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But it has good taste rather!</seg>
		<seg id="13">The company with the experimental approach of Charlie, based at Bristol, is known for its unusual perfumes of ice such as beer, cheese, ox and the sheet of gold.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But its next creation is announced even more ambitious.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He added: “I would like to really develop an invisible ice.”</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the crystals of ice which constitute the ice cream, but I think that I will find a way of arriving there.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Edward Snowden, the denouncer of the American intelligence services, declared that it was laid out to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr. Snowden in Russia Thursday, where it profits from the right of asylum, to discuss its testimony in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In a letter which the deputy presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Mr. Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continuous to treat the difference in opinion as an escape and seeks to penalize the political discourse with charges against which it is impossible to be defended.”</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, to tell the truth is not a crime.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to give up the penal loads retained against him.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A team of biologists directed by Wildlife Society Conservation of New York identified a new species of dolphin with bump with broad as of septentrional coasts of Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific operations manager at the Observatory for the Conservation and the Study of the Animals and Marine environments (OCEAMM) reconsider for L'Express this discovery and explain the long process of identification of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Does the discovery of this new species of dolphin with bump astonish you?</seg>
		<seg id="3">It is a good news, but that does not astonish me particularly.</seg>
		<seg id="4">So in the past, the species were described and identified on morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as the genetics enable us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of the species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It is not impossible besides that this progress in genetics and molecular biology calls into question the classification or the membership of a species to a kind, a family, and even an order.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At the beginning of the 19th century, the morphologists classified the animals, on basis as of morphological differences between the species.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today, some of these rankings are called into question because as of progress of the genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Same manner, two very close species morphologiquement were distinguished thanks to the genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is the case of the new species which has just been identified.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Some ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: dolphins with bump of the Pacific and humpback whales of the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The recent analyses made it possible to distinguish four species.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Why is it about a discovery of importance like affirmed it Wildlife Society Conservation?</seg>
		<seg id="13">From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">If this population were already known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that she belonged to a new species, presents only to this place.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Consequently, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or of accidental capture arises in the area, we could deal with the extinction of a species, rather than with a local disappearance of a population of a species more largely widespread on Earth.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This loss of genetic inheritance would be much more problematic.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A species is considered threatened or in way of extinction according to the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. stock, and possibility that it has to be restored starting from close stocks.</seg>
		<seg id="18">As regards the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the new species discovered is resulting, its stock automatically became weaker, making it thus more vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?</seg>
		<seg id="20">The marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They live in homogeneous habitats, open, in which there are many genetic exchanges between the populations and the individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This gene mixing limits the creation of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Contrary, more closed ecosystems support the genetic insulation, which can in the long term generate the creation of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It should be known that marine environment is the least well-known medium.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The deputy billionaire Cleaves Micrometer caliper advances that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest concerning the system of parental leave because his/her daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The tycoon of the mining extraction, which disputes the payment of a tax carbon of an amount of 6 M$, put forward this argument to try to draw aside the questions concerning a possible conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Palmer United Party could control up to four votes with the Senate, which could be crucial at the time to decide if the taxes carbon and mines must be removed.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that the girls of Mr. Abbott were ready to profit personally from these policies.</seg>
		<seg id="5">“It will have an important conflict of interest when it is a question of paying the parental leave because if one of his/her daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in the fact that it obtains or not a leave”, Mr. Palmer declared.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Two months after its election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer gained the head office of Sunshine Coast de Fairfax by 53 votes, after recount.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Not yet at the school and only a few months after having begun his first career, the toddler and his pony the Shetland Toffee trotted during the three turns with a great facility and gained the first price, leaving behind them the 30 other adult competitors.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The two inseparable ones – which is same size – were greeted for the presentation, the attitude and the style at the time of the annual competition which proceeded at the Sunnybank equestrian center, with Rudry close to Cardiff.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Presenting itself against men and women out of elegant bowler hats, it carried its cap punt a little on the side in a way relaxed to make ravel its Toffee pony 2 years old around the track.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Peg wood was greeted by the judges for its natural qualities of raising not very common for a child of its age.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And Toffee received very high notes for its presentation and its personality.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Peg wood had Toffee in gift for its 3rd birthday last March and was involved since with its Shetland pony the every day.</seg>
		<seg id="8">His/her mother Gave, 30 years, declared: “Peg wood and Toffee make an excellent duet.”</seg>
		<seg id="9">They were presented towards and against all, but both nicked the gold cut and the rivet washer.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It was only the second time that it contributed with Toffee and we were insane of joy which it gained.</seg>
		<seg id="11">On the track, people who did not know it thought that it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be made photograph with him.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, close to Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the traces of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has taken part in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Mrs. Howells declared: “There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applauded it.”</seg>
		<seg id="14">He traversed all the length of the track while running and even if he seemed to be very small, he did a marvellous job.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Peg wood is insane animals – he adores the horses, the tractors and the rural world and has two chickens of which he occupies himself.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Way in which it started, it will take part surely soon in the manifestation of the Horse of the year – and I am sure that it will make a beautiful service.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A spokesperson of the annual equestrian demonstration declared: “Peg wood is only 3 years old but it knows how to lead its pony.”</seg>
		<seg id="18">They train a good team.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The judges noticed that Peg wood and Toffee presented well and the way in which they ravelled on the track.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They search an effective team work between the pony and the tamer – Peg wood and Toffee were the best on the track.</seg>
		<seg id="21">I am sure that his beautiful clothing helped Peg wood, it had really proud pace.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Minister for Defense, Rob Nicholson, insisted to say that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all the soldiers before their return to the civil life.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Attacked by the liberals and the néo-democrats with the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson ensured that before their release, the members of the army followed a plan of transition in collaboration with their superiors.</seg>
		<seg id="2">All the wounded soldiers receive the suitable care for their return to the civil life and none of them is released before being ready, he affirmed.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The detractors show the government to want to save money while not allowing the wounded soldiers - who do not answer the rule of “the universality of the service” of the army requiring that staff be able to carry out a series of varied tasks - to reach the period of 10 years admissibility necessary for the services of retirement.</seg>
		<seg id="4">They in particular quoted two cases brought back by the Canadian Press, of which that of a soldier released last Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The corporal David Hawkins, a reservist of London, in Ontario, reached post-traumatic syndrome of stress, was released from the army in spite of his request to remain one year more in order to being able to receive a fully indexed retirement.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Its case occurred after that of the corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary committee, last month, which it had been thorough towards the exit before being ready because it did not answer the rule of universality of the service.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and meetings of consultation, but that was completely different that the fact of wanting to leave the rows.</seg>
		<seg id="8">“I told them that I was not ready”, he affirmed at the time of an interview with the Canadian Press Wednesday.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I asked during months if there were a means so that I can remain, and they said not.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Since the beginning as of major combat in Afghanistan, the army pains to determine which latitude it can grant to the wounded soldiers who want to remain in the rows, but which are not suited to the combat.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the terms of the current rules, the seriously wounded soldiers have up to three years to be restored.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If they do not answer the criteria for the deployments abroad, they can be forced to leave the army.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Data submitted last year to the Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the necessary working life to obtain services of retirement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The liberal spokesperson as regards veterans, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday for the rehabilitation of the corporal Hawkins, while the néo-democrat Jack Harris claimed the immediate end of “this ashamed practice”.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The benefit of Bomber in fall, whereas the deliveries and the orders of planes move back</seg>
		<seg id="1">Bomber Inc, aeronautical and railway manufacturer Canadian, announced a fall of 15 % of its net earning Thursday, under the pressure of a fall of the orders and deliveries of planes during the third quarters and problems contractual in its division Trains.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bomber, based in Montreal, either did not provide data of in-flight test for its very new CSeries plane nor of information making it possible to know if the plane will respect its ambitious calendar of commissioning commercial before next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the inaugural flight of the plane of test there are approximately a month and half, this last stole only three times, and the question then arose of knowing if the phase of test were in right track.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results were not worthy of forecasts and the exchange stocks moved back of 8 % at Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, analyst within National Bank Financial, lowered his notation Thursday, passing from “surperformance” with “performance of sector” because of the low potential of rise in the stock market during the next quarter or two next quarters.</seg>
		<seg id="6">“Although the fall of the deliveries of planes was mainly anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in division Transport”, Cameron Doerksen in a note with the customers declared.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We think that Bomber will record new orders for its CSeries planes as the test routine in flight advances.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, if no new order is announced during next months, we expect that the market becomes more skeptical about the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bomber hopes that the family of CSeries planes will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first plane of test was revealed in March and flew away for the first time in September after months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the number of firm controls for the CSeries planes is modest until now to a total value of 177. It seems that the potential buyers expect the results of in-flight tests to validate the assertions of the company concerning the energy efficiency and the potential of economies of the new airliner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At present, the company recorded a total of 403 orders and undertakings to buy near 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Pierre Beaudoin, president and chief of the direction, is convinced that Bomber will achieve its goal of 300 firm controls before the commissioning commercial of the first plane.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The leaders also reassured the analysts and the media Thursday in their indicating that the program advanced in accordance with the calendar.</seg>
		<seg id="15">“The plane of test did not remain on the ground longer than envisaged”, Mr. Beaudoin at the time of a conference call declared, adding that the ground tests and the software updates were envisaged during the downtime of the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Each manufacturer plans in a different way.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We had decided to carry out a first flight and to envisage one period of update, and it is what we did.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That will reproduce throughout the program of vol.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of the five planes of test should fly away in the weeks to come, the others will follow little time after, indicated the company.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, the analysts are skepticals as for the fact that the first customer can make fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bomber indicated that it was evaluating the calendar of service entrance and will provide new information during next months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">“This slowness of in-flight tests – although it is apparently in conformity with the internal calendar of Bomber – reinforces our opinion according to which the service entrance will be pushed back in first quarter of 2015”, Mr. Doerksen declared.</seg>
		<seg id="23">With the closed third quarters on September 30th, the net earning of Bomber fell to 147 M$, or 8 hundreds per action, compared to 172 M$, or 9 hundreds per action, one year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The per share earnings adjusted remained unchanged to 9 hundreds.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The incomes slightly moved back from 4.2 to 4.1 Md$.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The analysts expected a result of 10 hundreds per action and the incomes of 4.56 Md$, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth aeronautical manufacturer in the world indicated that it had delivered 45 planes during the quarter, against 57 one year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The clear orders fell to 26 planes, against 83 before.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The delay in Aeronautical division accounted for 32.9 Md$ at September 30th, quantifies unchanged compared to on December 31st of the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="30">“In Aeronautics, the results were in conformity with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general terms of the market were disappointing”, Mr. Beaudoin declared.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The incomes of Aeronautics dropped by 13 % to reach 2 Md$.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bomber, the largest railway manufacturer in the world, declared that the incomes of this division had increased of almost 11 % with 2.1 Md$.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The order book of division Transport added up 32.6 Md$ at September 30th, that is to say a light rise compared to on December 31st of the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The margins of division Transport suffered from the problems of execution concerning some large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarters.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The stock exchange of Bomber, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief of the financial management of Google Inc, would sit at the board of directors, fell of 8.5 % to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Brazilian company Embraer SA, third aeronautical manufacturer in the world and competitor nearest to Bomber, indicated Thursday a fall of 10 % of its quarterly earning.</seg>

		<seg id="1">“It is an alarming country and it is legitimate to raise the following question: what will prevent the Parliament from sweeping the independence of the legal system tomorrow? ”, the newspaper declared by disputing the government bill and requiring so that he be declared unconstitutional.</seg>
		<seg id="2">“This law is Draconian and very punitive, and let us refuse we it”, explained Cyrus Kamau, chief executive officer of Group Capital – owner of CapitalFM, one of the radio stations and independent websites of news the most respected in Kenya.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It indicated that the new court of the media “will be always partial because it is about a prolongation of the government” and that the restrictions relating to the contents and publicity would harm instead of Kenya in the worldwide economy.</seg>
		<seg id="4">“I hope that the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this government bill and to return it in front of the members of Parliament”, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the newspaper The Star, the new government bill will make it possible the government to have “the seizure on the media”. Standard The, as for him, indicated that the democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “had undergone a heavy blow” and fustigated the government bill describing it as “Draconian”.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The adoption of the government bill intervenes at the same time as series of measures aiming at reinforcing the national security in the wake of the attack perpetrated by the islamist ones armed in the shopping centre with Westgate last September.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Kenyan media caused the anger of the authorities by diffusing images of cameras of vidéosurveillance on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack concealed the shopping centre of luxury supposedly.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The chief of the police, David Kimaiyo, reacted by convening two journalists and a person in charge of the media to question them, although the convocation was withdrawn following raised shields in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Under the terms of the new government bill, the media could be liable to fines going up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and the journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk to be “erased” or to more be able to receive accreditation presses official.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The court also has the power to seize the goods of a contravener if this one did not pay its fine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to Daily Nation, “even only one fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations”.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He also says that measurements could have a devastating effect on what he described like the “animated blogosphere” of Kenya.</seg>
		<seg id="13">By reducing the media to silence, the politicians know that they can do what they want in all impunity.</seg>
		<seg id="14">“Nobody will never know”, wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist with The Nation, by describing the Kenyan media like a source of key control in the public life.</seg>
		<seg id="15">“Delivered to themselves, the politicians would put the country in bankruptcy and would bring back for us to hunting and the gathering.”</seg>
		<seg id="16">The Kenyan legislators were the target of the anger of the population in the past.</seg>

		<seg id="13">And then, it appeared all while revealing me my own facets which I had not perceived yet, masked by my relation with it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">I thus learned and understood that I had not at all lost the person of my mother but simply a woman whom I really did not know, a woman who incarnated this person, during his stay in the life.</seg>
		<seg id="15">While dying, this woman had perfect her life and released the person whom I loved, and here that I found it, full and whole.</seg>

		<seg id="5">A few tens of inhabitants, in majority of the descendants of mutinied of Bounty, still live Pitcairn, and their incomes depend in 95% on generosity on London.</seg>

		<seg id="7">A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Great Britain to validate this request.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, estimates that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for its island.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom sanctuariser these 836,000 km2, condition however of having the means of ensuring the monitoring of it, which is not the case.</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is no airport with Pitcairn, which makes impossible to base there one or more planes dedicated to the monitoring of the zone, and there is no port where to place military ships of monitoring.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Müller, which disappeared at the end of the Second World War without his trace being never found, has in fact buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery of Berlin, affirms the leader of the Memorial of German resistance, professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Müller did not survive at the end of the war.</seg>
		<seg id="3">“Its body was buried in 1945 in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte”, he ensured the daily newspaper with great pulling while being pressed on documents of archives.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would answer the one of the great enigmas of the Post-war period.</seg>
		<seg id="5">German secret services, the BND, ensured thus that during the summer 1949, Müller was with Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The secret services were mistaken completely.</seg>
		<seg id="7">“By August 1945, the body of Müller was found in a provisional tomb close to the old ministry for the Aviation of Reich by a commando”, according to Mr. Tuchel.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It carried “a uniform of general”.</seg>
		<seg id="9">“In the left inside pocket in particular its states of service with a photograph were”, he continues.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Bild also publishes a document of the town hall of district of the district of Mitte to Berlin indicating that it was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The president of the central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, stated himself shocked by this revelation.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohamed Morsi lent the oath of nomination, but it is not very probable that its day of triumph marks the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “Egypt news” when it lent the oath of nomination to the presidency, becoming thus the first chair freely elected and succeeding Hosni Moubarak who was driven out power 16 month earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="3">During his nomination before the High constitutional court, Mr. Morsi also became the first islamist president freely elected Arab world and the fifth Head of State of Egypt since the inversion of monarchy 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It lent oath in front of the 18 judges out of black dress of the Court whose building located in edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">“We aspire to better following days, an Egypt news and a second republic”, stated president Morsi during the solemn ceremony diffused live on public television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">“Today, the Egyptian people posed the bases of a new life – absolute freedom, a true democracy and stability”, explained Mr. Morsi, engineer a 60 year old trained in the United States, resulting from the Muslim brothers, a fundamentalist group considered during more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and hard repressed by the successive governments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and police officers kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, local time, followed by a small convoy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundreds of supporters had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and, dissociating presidential ostentation of the years Mubarak, circulation only was briefly stopped to allow the passage of its convoy in the very attended streets connecting the downtown area to the southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Regarded as the not very charismatic “spare wheel” of the Muslim brothers, his personal prestige was reinforced considerably since its victory and its speech of Friday during which it tried to be presented as the candidate not only the Islamist ones but of all those which want to finish the work started during the rising of 2011 against authoritative president Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">“Egypt is today a Civil status, national, constitutional and modern”, Mohamed Morsi declared, in blue costume and puts on a tie red, addressing to the judges present in the room decorated with woodworks where it lent oath.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Later, Mr. Morsi went to the university of Cairo where he made his speech of nomination.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It was officially accommodated by a military brass band which played the national anthem whereas it was put at the attention.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On its arrival, it was accommodated by the song “the people and the army, hand in the hand…” struck up by thousands of people gathered in the large amphitheatre of the university.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Founded in 1908 and old bastion of laic education, the university of Cairo became later a stronghold of the islamist groups of students in the years 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr. Morsi has made oath symbolic system Friday on place Tahrir, from where the rising left which put an end to the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers whose military council, which replaced the former ousted president, dispossessed it.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But while agreeing to officially lend oath before the Court, rather than before the Parliament as it is of use, it is inclined in front of the will of the army by showing that the fight for the power is not finished.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The speech of Mr. Morsi on the Tahrir place was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The airframe manufacturers quarrel about the width of the seats whereas large orders are concerned</seg>
		<seg id="1">The argument made fumes between the large aeronautical manufacturers in connection with the width of the seats of the economy class on the long-distance flights, opening up the way for a bitter confrontation at the time of the aeronautical living room of Dubai who takes place of month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The conflict relates to the width of the seats proposed on the long-distance flights to the passengers of the economic class – who always are not courted by the airline companies, but to which allocated space is essential to increase the profits of effectiveness in the last devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This week, Airbus invited the aircraft industry to set up a standard imposing a size of seat of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its large American rival Boeing declares that it should be with the airline companies to decide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The disagreement burst whereas the airframe manufacturers seek to sell versions even larger of theirs twin-engine long-distance planes, by possibly hoping for a record of orders at the time of the event which will proceed from November 17th to November 21st.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The way in which the seats will be laid out in the back of the plane – will in particular, be there 9 or 10 seats of face – is essential for the economic output of the segment of the “mini-jumbos”.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing declares that its “777X” refitted will be able to accommodate in economic class 406 people in seats of more than 17 inches broad, and will be configured with 10 seats per line.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus indicates that the concurrent version of its A350 will transport in economic class 350 people in seats of 18 inches broad configured in lines of 9.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The giants of aeronautics often exchange blows on technology matters by making publicity in the professional press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Today, Airbus calls some directly with the public before the aeronautical living room of Dubai, where the 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">One could realize recently of what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation with financial of a photograph showing three people the ones against the others with the restaurant, entitled “you would accept that?”.</seg>
		<seg id="11">“Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats narrower than on the aircraft regional turbopropellers”, John Leahy, sales director of Airbus indicated.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As the dietary habits change, people grow bigger, but the seats on the aircraft radically did not change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the beginning of the years 1970, when jumbo 747 of Boeing defined the modern long-distance travel, and the turning of the century, the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 years increased by 10 %, according to the data of the American department of Health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The waist measurement of the average American of the 21st century is of 39.7 inches, according to the American medical statistics.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus declares that its rival clings to a concept of seat which dates from the years 1950, when the circumference of the device coldly baptized “jet set” was narrower.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus adds that it ordered a study which indicates that an additional inch on the level of the width of the seats would improve quality of the sleep of 53 %.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputes the figures of Airbus with regard to the width of the seats and affirms that is not to the manufacturers to decide way in which the airline companies balance the price of the tickets and the equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="18">He also says that the study shows that the experiment in cabin does not depend only on the width of the seats.</seg>
		<seg id="19">“It is really a question of bringing flexibility to the airline companies and of enabling them to do what they think of having to make to undertake to good their activities”, Kent Craver declared, in charge of satisfaction passengers at Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want that one tells them what will enable them to be profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their company better than anybody.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For the passengers, it is more a question of having a certain freedom of movement, but for the suppliers, it is more and more a question which could affect their results.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the argument a race with the orders of planes for an amount estimated from at least 700 Md$ at the cost of market in the decades hiding place to come, sufficiently to tip the scales of American and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Comme Reuters indicated it for the first time in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what feeds the battle between the very last devices.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Airbus and Boeing assert both an output by seat in their last models of long-distance twin-engines 20 % higher than that of the leader of the market in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The performances announced by Boeing depend partly on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per line and a model 777 of origin configured in lines of 9.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The profit in terms of unit costs is currently weak compared to the device configured with 10 seats per line in service.</seg>
		<seg id="28">“Boeing does that to be able to put more seats and to make its planes more competitive by reports to our products”, Kevin Keniston, director of Momentary Comfort at the European airframe manufacturer declared Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On another side, the analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per line in 777 what exists suggest that many passengers decide in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with less expensive rates.</seg>
		<seg id="30">“A width of seat of 18 inches would be perfect for the passengers, but reality is that, from the commercial point of view, the proposal of Airbus is justified by the threat of the 777”, declared the expert one in interiors of cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but propose a catalogue of suppliers among whom the airline companies must choose.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The salesmen of planes which go the world carry even with them one meter to check the concurrent configurations.</seg>
		<seg id="33">While being windy to propose comfortable devices, all the manufacturers also offer planes with configurations to strong density with the airline companies low-cost and for the regional travel.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers A350 configured with 10 seats per line but indicates that it did not sell it yet.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for a greater personalization of the cabins by offering broader seats side gone on some of its planes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of alone the other large manufacturer of large modern devices, the experts say that it is not very probable that his call to the aircraft industry in order to set up a standard of size for the seats succeeds, but that it could make forget the wave of sales of 777X.</seg>

		<seg id="10">On the other scenes, the musical productions like “1789”, “the lovers of the Bastille” and the small musicals like “Disco music” or “Life and Times” put at the tuning fork success and quality.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Patrick Niedo, author of the book of reference “Stories of musicals” and lecturer to the Theatre of Châtelet, analyzes the reasons of success conquered so hard.</seg>
		<seg id="12">How do the French musicals evolve?</seg>

		<seg id="14">There are initially the “musical productions” who evolve with the liking of the producers…</seg>
		<seg id="15">Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Others leap up a fifteen years behind under pretext which one can serve about anything when one has Matt Pokora at the top of poster.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Afterwards, there are the musicals with the sumptuous productions of Châtelet which make us revive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest alive composer.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Entertainment internship popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The independent French producers try an opening.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But of the projects in progress like “Rent”, “the Kiss of the woman spider” or “the Awakening of spring” has difficulty being financed.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Do we have enough artists able as in Broadway of singer, to play and dance?</seg>
		<seg id="22">In Paris, when there are eight musical productions in one season, it is a great year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">We have 200 artists of talent who turn of projects in projects.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In the United States, cradle of the musical, it is very different.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The young people are trained with these trades in many schools.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Employment is numerous between the regional theatres, rounds, Broadway, off-Broadway…</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fish pond of talents is as consequent as the number of positions of power.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Why the rounds in province have do success as much?</seg>
		<seg id="29">Except for the opera, the province remains the poor relation of the culture in France.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Few plays leave in round and it is often light comedies intended to the adults and not for the young adults.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The musical productions fill this lack.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They are these same young people who like the reality TV and what it produces like transitory stars…</seg>
		<seg id="33">To propose beautiful young men (often talented) at the top of poster of a musical production, it is the insurance of a passion of these young girls and often of their whole family.</seg>

		<seg id="1">One could say that the town of New York is the place where was born the stand-up in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of light comedy Frank Fay, which held the role of master of ceremony with the De luxe hotel Theatre, on Broadway, started to tell jokes directly in front of the public, on the ton of the conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The innovation of Fay remained over the years, until being taken again more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the club of Carolines stand-up, the festival celebrates its tenth birthday this year, with more than 60 shows introduced in small clubs and Grand Theatres.</seg>
		<seg id="4">“Most tops of the bill emerged in Carolines, and had great success, until they became too famous to play in a club”, Hirsch declared.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We created this festival with an aim of being able to continue to work with them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The event of this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes”, one evening of comedy and music to the profit as of veterans, organized in Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, inter alia, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The festival gained in importance, just like the world of the comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Several of the actors taking part in the festival of this year passed by nontraditional circuits, by introducing for example shows on small TV channels, like Central Comedy, FX and Spike.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on the topic of the fantasy football joyfully lascivious of chain FXX) and has from now on his own show of sketches on Central Comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Jenny Slate took part in the emission “Saturday Night Live” and belonged to the casting of the series “Parks and Re-creation”, but it is however more known for its series of viral videos “Marcel the Shell with Shoes One”.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with the singular voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Beautiful Kamau), are pure products of the decentralized world of the American comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One of the independent factors of attraction of the festival this year will be a maintenance: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Steinberg started as an actor of stand-up, but he became a director of achieved cinema and television, as well as a semi-official historian of the comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Between 2005 and 2007, it animated an emission on TV Land which was called “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg”.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The appointment takes place with the Town hall, in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">“The city is definitively in the comic DNA of all the work of Larry”, Steinberg declared.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he descended a lane between two buildings and said himself Well, if I lose all my money, perhaps which I will come to live here.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Two employees of the marked YMCA of sexual assaults following allegations formulated against Jonathan Lord, at the time of an audience of the royal Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Two employees of the YMCA of News-Wales of the South were accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations formulated against the teacher to Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at the time of an audience of the royal Commission in charge of the sexual abuses on the children.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But in its declaration of opening before the Commission, the YMCA declared that it “had never had to deal with problem of sexual assault on children within his organization”.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The chief executive officer Phillip Hare was questioned about two business: an employee of the YMCA was accused of infringements relating to the child pornography and a monitor of physical education of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was recognized guilty of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mr. Hare declared in Gail Furness, legal consultant attached to the Commission, which it had had knowledge of the first business but which it was not with the current of the second.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He also admitted that the declaration of opening of the YMCA was inaccurate while underlining, “of external controls of the YMCA was carried out and indicated that the security of the children was an absolute priority for the organization.”</seg>
		<seg id="6">It was shown before the Commission which the YMCA had been informed that it had received the seconds worse appreciations on four establishments at the time of one to that the quality of Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr. Hare, who started to work with the YMCA at the 21 years age, admitted that the staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that it had omitted to check that the employees knew that they were held to announce any violation of the security policy of the children.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Earlier in the year, Lord was condemned for sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years when he worked with the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was condemned to a 6 years of prison sorrow minimum.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Mr. Hare rejected the idea according to which the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from announcing the failures of Lord towards the security of the children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The staff members testified that they had observed certain failures, in particular the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that it kept them into private, made them sit on his knees, told them that it liked them and let them play with its mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, who was framed by Lord and who had asked for a formation as regards protection of the children because it worried about its behavior, indicated that it found it responsible for the services to the childhood of the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who very framed Lord “intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time”.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The chief executive officer said that it rejected testimonies of the staff according to whom they were reticent with the idea to announce these failures to their hierarchically superior.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Instead of that, he declared that the friendly relations that they maintained with Lord scrambled their judgement, with the result that they did not announce his intrigues.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hare declared that it had expressed his point of view in front of the council of the YMCA of News-Wales of the South saying that, for the organization, the lesson drawn from “the incident Jonathan Lord” was not to relate to “the description” with staff, and the council was of agreement with him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr. Hare said that the decision to make sign with the staff of the agreements of confidentiality, shortly after that the allegations were evoked, was taken by the chief executive officer of the YMCA in charge of the services to childhood, Liam Whitley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He declared that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the pieces of evidence but which it acted of a “overzealousness” and that it had been badly put in work.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The YMCA of News-Wales of the South was not a sure organization for the children at the time where Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, declared the expert as regards sexual violences on the children, the Professeur Stephen Smallbone of the university of Griffith before the Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It indicated that there were “serious problems” in recruitment, control, initiation, the training and the supervision of staff.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a laic ceremony, in memory of all the late ones crematized in its establishment, during the year.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate with the town hall of Paris must assist to with it, and will explain then, at the time of a press conference his proposals as regards funerary.</seg>
		<seg id="3">To follow the ceremony, click above.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For their own funerals, more and more of French choose the cremation, rather than the burial: 53%, according to a Ipsos study realized September 6th and 7th near 1009 people, instead of 47%.</seg>
		<seg id="5">For funerals of a close relation, it is the reverse: the French prefer the burial (53% against 47%).</seg>
		<seg id="6">If they have misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose the cremation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In its book Death in ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National committee of ethics of funerary, insists on the “violence” which the cremation constitutes, for the survivors.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There is, with the cremation, “a violence made with the liked body”, which will be “reduced to a lot of ashes” in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which “would accompany the phases by mourning”.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There is also “a violence symbolic system”, which is due to the “obliteration of the singularity and the characteristics” reduced to the “anonymity” of ashes.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why what is accepted without sorrow in certain Scandinavian and Protestant countries, it is still badly lived in France?</seg>
		<seg id="11">“Because the cremation is a new fact”, Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Company of thanatology and author of the book answers To tame death.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It is tolerated only since 1963 by the Roman Catholic Church, which limited the attempts to tame it.</seg>
		<seg id="13">To tame the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, chief executive officer of the funerary Services of the Town of Paris, to envisage for late ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The annual inquiry of Ipsos shows a very strong attachment with the organization of the ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="15">77% of the French want one of them, for their close relations, that it is nun (53%), or civil (24%).</seg>
		<seg id="16">From now on, 73% of the people having chosen a cremation wish the organization of a ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="17">66% of the atheists or not believers wish it too.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The crematoriums adapted to this evolution of the company.</seg>
		<seg id="19">“For about ten years, they have endeavoured to avoid with the families the violence of waiting, without anything to make, during one hour and half, immediately followed by the handing-over of ashes”, Mr. Michaud-Nérard observes.</seg>
		<seg id="20">70% of the establishments propose from now on masters of ceremony, which proceed, in the presence of the body, with the following ritual: to accommodate the assembly, to name the late one, to connect it to the others, to evoke it, give direction to its death, to organize the good-bye.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is the case with the crematorium of Père Lachaise, since 1998.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The masters of ceremony are often people who reconverted themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="23">There are also former catholic priests.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is within this framework that the crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of All Saints' day, several ceremonies of the memory, laymen and nonreligious, to which it invites the families of the people who were crématisées in the year.</seg>
		<seg id="25">For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is broadcast enligne, for submission to those which could not make the trip.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Return in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Dance Dances his two new choreographies of group: the first inspired of inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second insufflated by the famous solos of piano Gymnopédies de Satie.</seg>
		<seg id="1">One evening which makes it possible to see all the prism of Chouinard, art to the tics and the black of ink to the white.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A white screen is used as head wall.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the carpet, also white, in the immense space which is the Maisonneuve Theatre, of profile, end like a line advances and dressed in black, a body.</seg>
		<seg id="4">On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The body, simple feature, takes its form.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And this form will be that of all the part: a row of physical imitations of the drawings.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The dancers, entirely dressed with black, only the hands and the face discovered, expect each side of the playground, precipitate when the next C-W communication appears, incarnate it, arise while running.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This game black and white of Henri Michaux makes out of relay solos, in group with unison (a mass which makes solo), in great group of twelve solos where each one carries out its sign.</seg>
		<seg id="9">One thinks of “Glory of the morning”, where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, posed online with the apron.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is the same principle, version PowerPoint giant.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Energy is high, the always fast rhythm.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It there will have break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the carpet of dance, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety nor selected, a share of the poem of Michaux, monotonous and monotonous in shouted, and will continue while dancing.</seg>

		<seg id="15">This sound and energetic discharge, long, if that may be, ends up deafening and numbing.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As the fact also regularity of the visual rhythm.</seg>
		<seg id="17">There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images was always a force at Chouinard - as this hair which are dishevelled or these black fabrics which lengthen the lines.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But the choreographic approach misses composition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">One has the feeling that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of the work of Michaux, asserted herself, with his tics.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Result: the bodies seem flat in front of the drawings.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Inks of Michaux, like forms of Gestalt, open imaginary broader and well stocked with game that the dance, more porous.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Only the end, into negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe lighting and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches with the magic.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The public liked, the reception was cordial.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Gymnopédies, after the interval, is richer.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The scene is partly draped of gray, the dancers and a piano is covered with fabrics, like furniture in a forsaken house.</seg>
		<seg id="26">With the piano, dancers take turns to play the partitions.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Their awkwardnesses in music, touching, give a true brittleness.</seg>
		<seg id="28">On scene, the couples pass, in duets in love, very sensual, even erotic.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Work of group, small solos of transitions, units which move, choruses, the writing is binary.</seg>

		<seg id="31">The loves are carnivorous, reducing or players.</seg>

		<seg id="34">A clown returns in scene when the free public.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The advisors closest to president Barack Obama planned, in the greatest secrecy, to replace the vice-president Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the list of 2012, according to New York Times.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This revelation is the event most outstanding which appears in very waited delivers marketing year 2012 of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Range Changes 2012”.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Times obtained a copy of the book to be appeared and told Thursday evening that the collaborator close relations of the president had undertaken “works deepened in groups and surveys at the end of 2011” to see whether the ousting of Biden could help Obama for her re-election whereas its hopes were reduced.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to the political correspondent of Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the high ranking officials of the countryside and of the White House, namely the former general secretary of the White House Bill Daley, aiming at measuring which effect the replacement of the vice-president by the former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the poll.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The possibility of an exchange is a secrecy which was savagely kept within the HQ of countryside of Chicago and the Oval office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only half a dozen close advisors of the president – in particular Daley, the former chief of countryside of Obama Jim Messina and former advisors in the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under investigation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">“Double Down” indicates that Daley carried out the load to replace Biden, in spite of their “close personal links”, before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that to have Clinton on the presidential list “clearly did not improve the chances of success of Obama”.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In a discussion with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden by Clinton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">“I said that I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them”, declared Daley with the newspaper.</seg>
		<seg id="10">You point out that at this time, the president was not forms some, and thus one thought, “Lord, that can we make?”.</seg>
		<seg id="11">While Daley qualified the examination of “concerted”, Martin indicated to Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested much to discover if the change would be beneficial at the time of the poll.</seg>
		<seg id="12">“The campaigns do not devote much money to the surveys and the newsgroups unless they seriously plan to take measures”, Martin declared on AC360.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, it is not known if Obama were with the current which its team examined the replacement.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if its owner of then were with the current of the possible rehandling.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Although Daley said that he did not think that the president “was with the current” of the possible change, the former general secretary admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Martin added that “Double Down” did not answer in a final way the question of knowing if the political surveys had arrived on the desk of Obama.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama did not know that the ousting of Biden of the presidential list was examined.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The subsidiary of Cogeco stated Thursday that it currently carried out preliminary tests of the beta release of this platform with some of its users.</seg>
		<seg id="3">“That will enable us to emphasize more convivial interfaces as well as more options”, explained the president and chief of the direction of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Cogeco Cable thus encases the step with its competitors, like Beautiful, even if the subsidiary of Cogeco does not have an exact date yet in what milked with this new platform.</seg>
		<seg id="5">“It is necessary to adapt and change or resist the change and to fail”, Mr. Audet underlined.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our customers currently do not have access.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Giant of telecommunications Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix so certain technical details, which were not quoted, could be regulated.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the United States, the popular video service says being in discussions with certain major câblodistributeurs so that its service is available via their platforms of diffusion.</seg>

		<seg id="15">On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated to have recorded a net earning of 43.8 million to the fourth quarters, or 82 ¢ by action.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is about a retreat compared to the net earning of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢ by action, of the same period last year.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The company established in Montreal explains this retreat by costs of depreciation connected to new acquisitions.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Cogeco acquired in 2012 the cablodistributor Atlantic Broadband, bench in the United States, for 1.36 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It was the first major acquisition of the company after that which had failed Portugal.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Last December, the company from Montreal also bought Peer 1 Network Undertaken, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.</seg>

		<seg id="24">The incomes of Cogeco Cable however increased by 45% to reach 470.4 million.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarters.</seg>
		<seg id="26">However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable is in rise 5546.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Mr. Audet does not worry to see the number customers to fluctuate of the kind.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Within the framework as of course of English literature, the pupils will have to study at least a Shakespearian part, a novel of the 19th century, a romantic poem and a contemporary British work of fiction of 1914 to our days.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The examination will also present “new texts” to encourage more diversified reading.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A course combining English literature and language will be removed.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Starting from 2015, the pupils will have to pass an independent GCSE of language, and will be strongly incited to choose a qualification separated in English literature.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Ministry of Education must publish tomorrow its new programs of English and maths – the first matters to undergo a radical revision.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It will proceed to changes in other fundamental matters the next year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In addition, Ofqual, the regulating Office of the examinations, will reveal a rehandling of the structure of the GCSE, with a new marking system and less course.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Expressing itself during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister for Education, declared that there was a “broad consensus as for the need to reform our system of examinations to restore the confidence of the public”, while insisting on the fact that the GCSE would be “more stimulative, more ambitious and more rigorous”.</seg>

		<seg id="11">Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of the timetable to the maths, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the thorough GCSE of maths – just as more large significance attached to the matters appearing in the international rankings – would encourage probably the schools to ensure more hours of course.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is the European elite lends to get bargains with Great Britain?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The campaign Business for Britain was launched in April with the promise to join together the companies and to define what the creators of wealths and employment want to see changing in our relation with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">With this intention, we ordered the broadest investigation and most complete to the British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Great Britain, the companies and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov questioned more than 1 000 entrepreneurs, overall representative of all the sizes of companies, of the sectors and areas of Great Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for much.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We discovered that the vast majority of the companies seek from now on to export apart from Europe, while concentrating on the countries which are modernized and developed while the States of the EU stagnate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want to see the government giving priority to new commercial links with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than to sink in the long and difficult process of reform of the European institutional mysteries.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When one asks them for their opinion on specific political points – energy of the regulation of monopoly to the laws on the products – the majority of the entrepreneurs think that the control of these key competences should turn over to the hands of Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The single market caused a general dissatisfaction, the companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate compared to the advantages that there is to belong to the European zone of exchanges – 40 % of the large companies, traditionally pro-most European, are even of agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Lastly, and what is more still speaking, our investigation near the entrepreneurs revealed that an important majority wanted to see Great Britain continuing the initiatives in favour of a change of the treaty and development of a relation with the EU based on the trade and not the policy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This conclusion, which is found in all the great groups and the companies of all sizes, shows that the world of the company insists for a “significant change” which gives again the power in the United Kingdom.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The challenges are high – to manage to change the treaty and to better represent the interests of Great Britain would make it possible to see a swing of 16 % of the votes in favour of the maintenance of the country in the EU at the time of a referendum.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Prime Minister should not doubt only one moment: this investigation shows that the British companies support this plan aiming at renegotiating the terms of the accession of Great Britain at the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that the companies hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of the power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of the British companies, since the euro zone is committed to an economic and tax union narrower.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority must be employment and growth in Great Britain and, as the conclusions of our investigation show it, for the companies that means to again focus on the trade and a fundamental change of the lawful approach of Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Standard credit rating agency &amp; Poor' s.a lowered Friday the note of solvency of the Ukraine, putting in doubt the capacity of the Soviet ex-republic, in recession since more than one year, to cope with its financial obligations.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The note of the titles of national debt of the country passes to “B”, being inserted in the category of the speculative investments.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It is supplied with a negative prospect, S&amp;P seeing at least a chance on three that it is again lowered within one year.</seg>
		<seg id="4">“It is less and less probable that the strategy of the government makes it possible to guarantee sufficient foreign currencies to cope with its high external financing needs”, explains the American agency.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The agency raises that monetary reserves of the Ukraine fell of 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and provides that the trend will continue.</seg>
		<seg id="6">That complicates the refunding of the appropriations taken abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="7">These reserves, to which the authorities resort massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, crumbling, the agency considers increasingly probable a devaluation, which would inflate its foreign debt.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Kiev in addition needs liquidities to regulate its gas importations in Russia, which shows it not to have paid an invoice of 882 million dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This announcement constitutes a bad news for the Ukrainian power during one time of sharp tensions with its Russian, furious neighbor of the will of Kiev to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It was made public at the following day publication of official statistics showing that the economy of the country had undergone between July and September its fifth quarter of continuation of contraction.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Its debt, still relatively modest, exploded these last years and S&amp;P the regard at 33.5% of the GDP, against less than 10% before the crisis of 2008-2009.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The country, in budget deficit, claims since months the assistance of the Funds international currency, which had granted to him in 2010 a credit of 15.3 billion dollars and resolved them for the moment only 3.4 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the Funds refuses to pour all new slice as long as the country will not have adopted reforms unpopular to reduce its deficit, in particular by increasing the prices of gas to the population.</seg>
		<seg id="14">At the conclusion of a new unfruitful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that “the important requirements in external financing” constituted “a vulnerability”, while raising “of the signs of improvement economic”.</seg>
		<seg id="15">However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Center of the political Studies, “one cannot expect a short-term improvement”.</seg>
		<seg id="16">“There is little hope that unpopular reforms are launched in one year pre-electoral”, the presidential elections being envisaged in 2015, raises the expert, questioned in AFP.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The only hope, it is an improvement of the international conjuncture.</seg>
		<seg id="18">S&amp;P raises moreover “uncertainty” related to the possible signature of an association agreement between the Ukraine and the EU, that Brussels conditions with the release of adverse Ioulia Timochenko.</seg>
		<seg id="19">“To sign the agreement would be positive for the long-term trade but there could be negative consequences with short and medium term related to the reaction of Russia”, explained S&amp;P, which fears “commercial restrictions” on behalf of Moscow.</seg>

		<seg id="1">At a pawnbroker of the shopping centre of Bendemeer to Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings out of gold to pay the school fees of his/her daughters.</seg>
		<seg id="2">“My husband and me have just bought a house thus all my money left inside”, Mrs. Amirthalinga declares.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although it gains 3 000 $ of Singapore (2 400 $) per month as an administrator and that her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In fact, the request is such in certain parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of the households increases – which ValueMax, where it carried out its transaction, the third company of loans against security became this week to being introduced at Singapore Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">To pawn jewelry is not only one average rapid to obtain cash – 1 300 $ of Singapore in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but they are almost as cheap as the unguaranteed bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In general, the pawnbrokers of Singapore take an effective annual interest rate of 17 %, just above 15.4 % offered by United Overseas Bank, a local money-lender having a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, the pawnbrokers have the advantage of not asking for a checking of solvency or proof of wages, and can resolve the loans more quickly than the banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Consequently, million people through the area turns to the pawnbrokers whereas the families feel the pressure which exerts the increase in the cost of living and the over-indebtedness of the households and the consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of solid growth since the world financial crisis, and the cheap credit supplied with a monetary policy too laxist in the advanced economies, the families with weak and average income turn to the pawnbrokers to fill the difference whereas their economies know a deceleration.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week, the Standard credit rating agency &amp; Poor' s.a quoted the debt growing of the households, rising mainly from the rise of the mortgage financings, like a risk factor for the solvency of the Asian banks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">She declared that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the ratio debt of the households/the highest gross domestic product of Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia arrives top of the list with 80 % of the GDP, whereas this rate rose to 60 % in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The economists also fear the elevated level of consumer indebtedness in Thailand, which left little this week of a technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Thursday, data showed a continuous weakness of exports and a deceleration of the request of the consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="15">“The assessment is that with rise in costs, the people in the medium or bottom [of the pay scale] seek to supplement their incomes as they can”, Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank declares.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The historically high prices of gold during two last years made that people hastened to pawn their personal effects to touch the value in cash their jewelry.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore, approximately 70 % of the articles pawned in the 200 shops of loan against security of the city-state are out of gold.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People say, “the ransom price is high, pawn the gold chain of grandmother and one will return to seek it the next month”.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand, the largest operator of shops of loan against security, EasyMoney, recorded a rise of 20 % amongst customers using his shops during last months.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The rise is such in the sector of the loan against security that ValueMax, operator of the shop with Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this one in Singapore, envisages to develop not only in close Malaysia – where it counts already four shops – but also apart from Asia, Yeah Lee Ching declares, its chief executive officer.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will finance them by using 60 % of the 66 M$ of Singapore which it raised this week during its introduction to Singapore Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While certain lenders withreduced tax wiped criticisms for exorbitant interest rates which they use, Miss Yeah indicates that the setting guarantees offer of it not only rates less low than the other lenders, but that in more it does not increase the debt directly.</seg>
		<seg id="23">“The customers mortgage goods which they have already, and the fact of monetizing their personal goods does not increase the debt of the households”, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The setting in pledge is better and better accepted socially like means of obtaining a financing guaranteed in the short run.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The people who go to the pawnbrokers are not either only those which have financial problems.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Easy people of Singapore also go in the shops of loan against security ValueMax to pawn gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see customers of all the layers of the company.</seg>
		<seg id="28">“It can be easy people who need to borrow in the short run for marketing activities or investments, or small companies which have needs for treasury to pass a difficult course”, Miss Yeah adds.</seg>

		<seg id="5">Basharat Ditta, 42 years, gave sensitive information to the lord of the crime Neil Scarbrough concerning of the investigations on its linked activities with the drug trafficking after being itself compromised because of its practice to consume cocaine.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The lawyer, who was called “Bash” and was regarded by the criminals as a “file of first importance”, was stopped at his place in 2011 following operations of listening of the police directed towards Scarborough, which it had represented at the time of a previous lawsuit in relation to the drug trafficking.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The police officers located Sarborough, 32 years, depositing three bags of cocaine in the residence of lawyer with Blackburn, in Lancashire, whereas it attended a dinner of the Bar with fellow-members.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this drug of class A after tests showed traces of cocaine in its hair, on its wallet and its credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Over one eight month period between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain in an illicit way of information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough like one of his associates.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The four suspects were supervised at the time by the police within the framework of an important investigation into a traffic of heroin and cocaine proceeding in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire terrier.</seg>
		<seg id="11">With 32 other men, they were imprisoned thereafter after the police seized of heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 M£, like more than 200 000 £ in cash during a series of raids.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Ditta, 42 years, provided information to the criminals because it feared that its drug-addiction is revealed at the great day.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today, to the Court of Assizes of Liverpool, Ditta, which works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors located at Blackburn, fell in disgrace after being recognized guilty on two counts of indictment of obstacle to justice after a three weeks lawsuit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He had admitted the cocaine possession during a previous audience.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The fall of lawyer occurred after the police, inquiring into Scarborough, discovered that it had been regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two investigators followed the suspect and located it arriving at the residence of Ditta and placing drug, pure to 60 %, under the dustbins of lawyer in a glove of black golf.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Little time after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta which was with a dinner at the football stadium of Ewood Park, enclosure of the club of the Blackburn Rovers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer is turned over at his place, discovered drug and they were telephoned nine recoveries.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this drug of class A in its hair, on its wallet and its credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta was stopped later but denied to consume cocaine. He declared that he had spoken to the supposed drug trafficker because it was its customer and made the point that their discussions were subjugated with a “legal privilege”.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During its arrest, Ditta collected its wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they all were seized and a sample of hair was taken to him.</seg>
		<seg id="22">At the time of a interrogation, he declared that he had an office in his residence, just as with his workplace and than it happened that customers call it at his place for questions of legal order.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the court heard testimonies according to which it called principal actors in the trade of the drug, of which some which it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were with the current.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The prosecutor Anne Whyte declared: “If somebody must know that the law should not be violated, it is well a lawyer specialist in criminal law.”</seg>
		<seg id="25">Mr. Ditta is shown to have misused his position as a lawyer specialist in criminal law, and to be itself too much implied near particular customers.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relation about which we speak is not simply a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker providing of drug to his own lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of its communications will be without any doubt of the legitimate communications because it was its lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But that went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relation between a lawyer and his customer.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It blocked the investigation of the police as much as it could to enable him to continue its criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr. Ditta did not make honor with his profession, but dishonoured it.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It approached certain customers too much, in particular Scarborough, and it let compromise its independence.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta denied any illegal dealing and declared: “If I were a corrupted lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after the audience, superintendant it Lee Halstead of the Police of Lancashire declared: “Mr. Ditta passed from lawyer specialist in criminal law to criminal himself since it started to get drug near criminal organizations.”</seg>
		<seg id="34">Its addiction with cocaine compromised it forever and made it vulnerable to the ulterior motives leader members of the organized criminal groups which charged it with obtaining invaluable information concerning of the investigations of police.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The lawyers should observe the most strict rules of integrity and found a climate of trust near the public.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Mr. Ditta betrayed this confidence and tried to shelter behind varnish of his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The unit in charge of the serious and organized crime of Lancashire investigated Mr. Ditta, who was recognized guilty of the three counts of indictment of cocaine possession and maintaining of obstacle to justice, testifying to his commitment to continue the criminals in justice.</seg>
		<seg id="38">That this business serf of warning to the criminals so that they know that nobody is above the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and will translate for you in front of the courts.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough itself was imprisoned during 14 years after having pled guilty of complicity of traffic of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Thirty-five other people implied in the traffic were condemned to a 153 years of prison total for drug trafficking.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On its site, Ditta organized a questions session/answers on itself during which he said that his job of dreamed would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the corridor of death in America, its last guest to dine would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would be what would justify it to work.</seg>

		<seg id="0">One year difficult for the pharmacists</seg>
		<seg id="1">The departure of almost 10 pharmacists at the Health centre and social services (CSSS) of Laval because a whole agitation with the direction of the Hospital of City-of-the-Health, and this, at the time of the year 2012-2013.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Because of multiple departures to the retirement, maternity leave or departures very short, the department of pharmacy was strongly overdrawn as a staff.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It missed nearly 30% of manpower necessary, making this year financial “very difficult”, according to the chief of the department, Gillian Beaudet.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, the CSSS decided not to engage of independent labour, which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time committed pharmacist.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One did not have recourse to the breakdown service, explained Mrs. Beaudet.</seg>
		<seg id="6">One rationalized or decreased some of our activities inside the establishment for stage, time that the things are replaced.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is sure that one worked extremely to interest our young people [resident in pharmacy] so that they come and remain here.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There is a coincidence which made that one was in a bad situation the last year.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Improved situation</seg>
		<seg id="10">After this difficult period, year 2013-2014 is announced definitely easier for the department of pharmacy of the CSSS.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Already, three pharmacists are of return to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists were engaged during last months.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moreover, the efforts made by the department in order to retain bore fruits, because the four pupils at present in residence in Laval also decided to remain with the use of the CSSS.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Now, that is much better, underlined the pharmacist.</seg>
		<seg id="14">From here the financial end of the year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three returns of maternity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">That will thus come to fill our departures of the last year.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Always increasing needs</seg>
		<seg id="17">The situation remains however delicate.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Several factors, like the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or a prevalence of young women in the trade, make situations such as that lived in 2012 difficult to envisage.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For us [the number of manpower] is always precarious, because there is a medium which is young and many young women are employed, therefore with the pregnancies, one almost always rolls to three maternity leave when that is well, she added.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The last year, one had of it much more and one does not have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, therefore it was more difficult.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The survivors and the close relations of the 202 people killed in the attacks of Bali in 2002 reacted with anger to the sorrow pronounced against the last of the conspirators to being translated into justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, which spent almost 10 years leaks some while being one of the most searched men of Southeast Asia, was condemned yesterday to a 20 years of prison sorrow for its role in the manufacturing of the explosive devices used at the time as of attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It could be released at the end of 15 years under release on parole.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Man of 45 years has be recognized guilty of slaughter of mass for attacks aiming two nightclubs in tourist area popular of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australian, and made many casualties.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He was also recognized guilty many other counts of indictment in relation to terrorism, in particular a wave of attacks aiming of the churches in all Indonesia the day before Christmas in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The prosecutors asked for a sorrow of life imprisonment, however they could have asked so that the man, qualified “Man Demolition” for his reputation of expert in manufacturing of bombs, be prisoner under sentence of death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost his two 39 year old binoculars, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators there is nearly 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the edge of the tears, she declared that Patek should have been prisoner under sentence of death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I really think that it should have followed the same way as the other men.</seg>
		<seg id="10">“It should be trailed in front of the firing squad”, Mrs. Corteen with the AAP declared.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I must live the every day without having other grandchildren, nor to see my daughters.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Sari Club was entirely destroyed when an enormous bomb, charged in a light van parked outside, exploded just after 23:00 on October 12th 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was in Paddy' S Bar when a kamikaze made there earlier jump a rucksack charged with explosives hardly 20 seconds.</seg>
		<seg id="14">There sank in the coma the shortly after the attack and remained unconscious for one month, and he “died” three times whereas he was under respiratory assistance.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hugues declared that Patek should have known the same fate as three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were carried out 4 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Actually, this man should have been prisoner under sentence of death before the others.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To keep in life, why, there is no reason to keep it in life.</seg>
		<seg id="18">To spend 20 years in prison after having killed 202 people and having wounded hundreds of others, it is not much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the bomb planters of Bali to being translated into justice.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It had succeeded in avoiding being made capture during almost 10 years but was finally stopped in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former chief of Al-Qaïda, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the lawsuit, an agent of the FBI declared that reports of the intelligence services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden with an aim of restoring links between the terrorist groups of Southeast Asia and Al-Qaïda.</seg>
		<seg id="22">“It did not go”, Mrs. Corteen added.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently, he made fun passionately of the sorrow which he had been able to cause with other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The verdict was returned the day before the 10th birthday of the attacks which will be celebrated later this year and will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and in Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">“There will be many tears this year”, Mme Corteen said.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Imbroglio around the closing of the urgencies of the Hospital</seg>
		<seg id="1">Vis-a-vis the sling carried out since several months by part of staffs and several trade unions, whose CGT, the Minister for health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10th “to shift the calendar of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closing of the urgencies which will not be able to intervene on November 4th”.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A request officially made “not to run any risk on the assumption of responsibility of the urgencies to Paris at the beginning of the winter” but which also aimed at not obstructing the countryside of the PS in a few months of the local elections.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In spite of the ministerial instructions, closing should be effective all the same on this date.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Even if, with the APHP, one prefers to employ the term of “transformation” or of “change in continuity”.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Starting from November 4th, the firemen  who ensured approximately a quarter of the 40,000 annual passages the urgencies of the Hospital  will have received all for instruction to take along about thirty serious cases per day towards the urgencies of other Parisian hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This dated November 4th also corresponds to the renewal of the boarding schools.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With the Hospital, the interns specialized in urgencies will leave room Monday to five interns of general medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As for the transfer of the beds of internal medicine, it is programmed for the current of the month.</seg>
		<seg id="9">“The service of reception of the urgencies of the Hospital must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is on November 4th”, ensures without turning Loïc Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the project of the direction.</seg>
		<seg id="10">“On November 4th, there will be no more patients brought by the firemen, only of the people coming by their own means”, confirms professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical person in charge of the new Hospital.</seg>
		<seg id="11">“But we will continue to accommodate patients in urgency”, he moderates, putting forward the permanent presence of vehicles of the SMUR on the spot to transfer the serious cases.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Doctors A&amp;E doctors seniors will remain on the spot, he also ensures.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But it is with the ARS that it belongs to decide the closing of the service of reception of the urgencies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">“The things are done gradually”, answers Nicolas Péju, spokesperson of the ARS for which, on November 4th, “it will not have there change in terms of done favour.”</seg>
		<seg id="15">“The minister lied us or one lied to him”, the doctor A&amp;E doctor Gérald Kierzek regrets.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Dislocated of its post of head of the SMUR to have carried out the sling against the reorganization project at the beginning of July, it is defined as a “launcher of alarm” vis-a-vis a “cynical” decision catch by “medical and administrative technostructure”.</seg>
		<seg id="17">“They are emptying and to asphyxiate urgencies which were renovated there is less than five years”, he estimates.</seg>
		<seg id="18">For him, “if the other Parisian services of urgencies could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem”.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However they are regularly blocked.</seg>
		<seg id="20">For example sometimes nine hours ago of waiting to the urgencies of Lariboisière.</seg>
		<seg id="21">With the ARS, one makes the point that thirty patients “dispatchés” on several sites are not likely to represent a “avalanche” in the other services of urgencies, whose human means will in addition have been reinforced.</seg>
		<seg id="22">With the ARS as with the APHP, one defends the “new hospital model” already started since October 7th and which should continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">By the end of the year, liberal general doctors should also come to take part in the installation of a “permanence of ambulatory care”.</seg>
		<seg id="24">“Where one goes if one asks people auto--to diagnose oneself”, questions Gérald Kierzek for whom “the concept urgently not engraves” is “dangerous” and marks a “medical regression”.</seg>
		<seg id="25">That will occur as for maternities from level 3.</seg>
		<seg id="26">People are not insane, they will go where there is the best offer of care.</seg>
		<seg id="27">If the minister does not take a measure by Monday, we will change gear ratio, warns Christophe Prudhomme, doctor A&amp;E doctor and member of CGT Health.</seg>
		<seg id="28">We will be even more present within the framework of the municipal countryside and we will reflect to present a list.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor of Paris and elected official of the 4th district, announcement clearly that “even if UMP Parisian were for the maintenance of the urgencies to the Hospital, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if one returns to the responsibilities”.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Anne Hidalgo, the candidate PS, as for it again recalled Monday morning on France Inter that it had decided in favour of a moratorium so that there is no closing on November 4th.</seg>
		<seg id="31">If it were the case, it would mark its dissension Net, underlines Bruno Julliard, his spokesperson.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Even if the reorganization of the Hospital has its legitimacy on the bottom, we cannot admit it without an acceptable diagram of carryforward towards the other hospitals.</seg>

		<seg id="1">He will never have known the word reprocesses.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, deceased Thursday at 83 years, had just published its 200e SAS, “the Revenge on the Kremlin”.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In February, New York Times had devoted it as “the author of spy novels which knew too much of it”.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It then had just spent ten days to Afghanistan, theatre of the 198 and 199es opus of the famous series of spy novels.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Decreased physically by a very serious heart disease in December 2010, it moved during this travel with a deambulator.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And before Afghanistan, it had also set out again in Libya, in Russia, in Lebanon and Mali.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8th, 1929 in Paris, ensured to be unaware of the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of “SAS in Istanbul”, the first of the series, there is close to a half century.</seg>
		<seg id="8">“Undoubtedly between 120 and 150 million all confused countries”, he advanced last March.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Its Burmese cat on the knees, in the living room of its immense apartment of a building of the avenue Foch within walking distance of Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under its grey hair, it quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.</seg>
		<seg id="10">“Not counting the editions pirates”, he added, indicating a pile of books on the coffee table between bronzes or the brought back ivories of the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels at it.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For the price of a cigarette pack, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photograph of one young woman to the advantageous chest, carrying a gun or a rifle of attack.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Inside, its highness sérénissime (SAS) the prince Malko Linen, desilvered Austrian aristocrat and contract employee of the CIA to pay repairs of the castle of family, launches out to the cases of all the malicious ones of the ground, Communists of the Seventies and Eighties, then Jihadists as from the Nineties.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With each book, the same receipt: a great amount of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of sex hardware, a zest of violences and tortures.</seg>
		<seg id="14">“I never claimed to be a literary author”, explained Gérard de Villiers.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I regard myself as a storyteller who writes to distract from people to which I do not send a message.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He worked “like large the prewar reporters, of the type Albert Londres, which went on the spot and returned with the true ones and long investigations”.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The father of SAS said “to make a kind of geopolitical serial”.</seg>
		<seg id="18">“I am permanently my files (Afghanistan, Syria,…) before leaving”, Gérard de Villiers added.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On the spot, I meet journalists, of which those of AFP, diplomats, people of the services that I know for some since twenty or thirty years.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, many its SAS are often premonitory: thus, a month before the attack of a command centre of the Syrian mode having killed several high ranking officials, he had told the story in “the Street called straight”.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In “the Insane ones of Benghazi”, it had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret command centre of the CIA in this city, cradle of the Libyan revolt.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In 1980, it put in scene the assassination of Egyptian president Anouar El-Sadate in “the plot of Cairo”, one year before the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In October 2012, in “Panic in Bamako”, he reported the columns of 4X4 of Jihadists which based on the capital Malian.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I am not soothsayer, defended Gérard de Villiers, I make simply assumptions starting from country that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are carried out.</seg>
		<seg id="25">After this travel in often disturbed zones, it settled for one month behind its typewriter IBM with daisy going back to 1976 “of which all the parts were changed”.</seg>
		<seg id="26">300 pages later, he wrote the “FINE” word and corrected each page with the pen.</seg>
		<seg id="27">To the walls of its office are hung rifles of attack AK-47, erotic photographs and photographs of the author with African lords of war.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and racism by organizations of the human rights, Gérard de Villiers drew aside these charges in two sentences.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Certain women are sex objects in my books but of others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.</seg>
		<seg id="30">I am always well accommodated in Africa where I count very many readers.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Gérard de Villiers had said it: “Malko Linen, like all the heroes, does not have an age”.</seg>
