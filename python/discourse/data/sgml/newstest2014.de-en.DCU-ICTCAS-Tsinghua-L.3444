		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend, to treat hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one in 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here you vote or from your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can for him, or any of the other heroes in the Top 10, in order to &quot;CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The winner receives $250,000 to continue her exceptional work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and went to hospitals that do not have the means at their disposal to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, injured.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First, he had a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation, expanding on his brain and caused a hematoma, the impact for the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There were no Neurochirurgen in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have released him from Cameroon, if we had had the money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Bwelle spent years his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, in order to get the treatment that they had to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is not easy,&quot; said Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">At five o'clock in the morning, you can leave the house and run the hospital, in order to be the first, and it is not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are very many patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some people even die because they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation has scarcely changed since Bwelles father died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In contrast, the ratio in the United States with a doctor for 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians visiting.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health spending in the country are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And the poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">His father, and so many of his countrymen are allowed to ripen Bwelle decided to do something about it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team last year 700 free operations carried out.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In addition, he founded a nonprofit organization called ASCO Vime who travels on weekends in rural areas and free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">He squeezed almost every Friday and up to 30 people in minibuses and proceed with the verschnürten medical equipment on the roof over unbefestigtes terrain in the villages that need help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Everything is not always smooth.</seg>
		<seg id="32">More than once they had the vehicles through rivers and mud.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as heroes: A banquet, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages is free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with its broad smile and his boundless energy - is the joyful celebration.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We are dealing with 500 people per ride,&quot; Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">You come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village - and on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are due to malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening, the team simple operations with local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operations are normally in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the surgery, the patient and go in the relaxation area, in order to make room for the next.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The illumination of the OP and disinfection equipment is powered by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work until the early hours on Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It is a demanding job, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They drum all night to stay awake and so that we can continue our work,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the team goes back into the city, tired, but proud of the work that has been done.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group - a mix of Cameroonian doctors and medical students - in the past year has 700 free operations carried out and know that their work is an enormous difference for the people, which helps.</seg>
		<seg id="48">A man explained that the free operation of a ', which he received now allows him to return to work.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;The change the future of my family,&quot; said the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital at night Bwelle works in private clinics in Yaoundé.</seg>
		<seg id="51">With this second job, he financed 60% of its charitable activities, Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I really do not know when he sleeps,&quot; says Katie O'Malley, in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studied medicine and voluntarily in Bwelles group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so that he can go to these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gather practical experience that they would never get at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We can be in operations, where we help blood abzutupfen or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; says O'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">This would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The students typically pay for their trip to Cameroon and often donated medical material.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle accommodation, transport and guide.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He is without doubt a hero,&quot; says O'Malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon, knows no bounds.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bwelle is the almost constant work, not a burden.</seg>
		<seg id="62">The other to a happier life, and in order to fulfil a promise that he has given to his father gives him great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I'm so happy if I make this work,&quot; says Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think of my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I do.</seg>
		<seg id="66">I do it in order to bring people back to laugh and to relieve pain.</seg>

		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis has decided that its decision to convene the children in February to announce in advance, so that other meetings, the participation of the cardinals from around the world, can be planned,&quot; said Lombardi.</seg>

		<seg id="4">The results of the survey will surprise many.</seg>

		<seg id="6">They want the government to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are promoted, instead of dealing with the long and arduous process, to reform the obscure institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Asked for their opinion on certain legal issues - from fair trading legislation to product legislation - the majority of business leaders think that control over the key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was a general dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to the company, the cost of the Brussels rules now would outweigh the advantages to be part of Europe's trade - even 40 percent of large companies, which have traditionally voted the most Europhile.</seg>

		<seg id="13">It also shows that the company from a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the formation of a judge, the changes to the Stop-and-Frisk-Programm (&quot;stop and search&quot;) of the New York Police Department had demanded, and for the judge of the case.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The 2nd repercussions said that the decisions by Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal is decided in the city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The judge had ruled in August that the city goes against the Constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people will be implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city appealed against their assessment and ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up an observatory, which the police with the amendment of the directive and the corresponding training programme should support.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Court of Appeal on Tuesday heard the arguments for the suspension.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case, because it violates the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, specifying that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship; this was, in part, with a series of media interviews and public statements, in which they publicly responded to the criticism of the Court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk program were targeted.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It has appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of key changes, including reforms to policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot programme with the body worn cameras in areas in which most of the checks were carried out.</seg>

		<seg id="12">It is this type of inspection for decades in various forms, but increased the number of recorded controls during the term of the other independents Mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.</seg>

		<seg id="15">Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; it would also waste money and the wider problem of a police force is not resolved, after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade under pressure.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The judge pointed out that they do not finish the Stop-and-Frisk-Praxis, constitutional, but only the kind of implementation of controls by the NYPD reformiere.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people in the bombing in Bali in 2002 killed, were angry about the verdict for the last of the plotters, who was put on trial, because Umar Patek they believe state law should be shot.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, nearly ten years as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was yesterday for his role in the building of explosives for the bombing to a sentence of 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">With suspended, he could be released after 15 years.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45 year old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.</seg>
		<seg id="5">There has also been a guilty verdict in a number of terrorism related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The prosecution had asked for a life sentence, even if it is for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb maker - also known as &quot;Demolition Man&quot; to apply the death penalty.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision has sparked painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, the 39 year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in Patek and his Mitverschwörern devastation caused nearly ten years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Fighting back tears, she said, Patek could be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;It should be put before a firing squad,&quot; said Corteen to AAP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I have to live with it every day, that I will have no further grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Sari Club was razed to the ground, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a powerful bomb exploded in a light truck, which was parked in front of the nightclub.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds before a suicide bombers detonate a backpack filled with explosives.</seg>
		<seg id="14">After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and &quot;died&quot; three times while he was on a life support system.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hughes said that Patek, deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiah-Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Really, this guy should get the death penalty.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Let him alive - no, there is no reason to keep it alive.</seg>
		<seg id="18">20 years on, after he 202 people were killed and hundreds injured, is not much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber, who was in court.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He is almost a decade of detention, but was finally in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces nearly four months later, the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killed.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had made the point that Patek was in Pakistan, in order to meet bin Laden with the aim of making the link between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;He has not been asked,&quot; said Corteen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently, he has shown no remorse for it, how much pain he has caused to other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The ruling came before the 10th anniversary of the attack in this year, with commemorations in Bali and Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;This year there will be many tears,&quot; said Corteen.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Patek can still appeal against his sentence.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported on Thursday a 15-prozentigen fall in net profit, after declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railway sector was under pressure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bombardier, based in Montreal, no flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the plane, according to the ambitious timetable next September could go into commercial use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the maiden flight of the test aircraft from one and a half months followed so far, only three more launches what it seems questionable whether the trial as planned.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results were behind the forecasts and led to a drop of more than eight percent of the Stock Exchange of Toronto.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating from &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;sector perform&quot; in view of the fact that the stock in the next one or two quarters of a limited course potential.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The weaker suppliers have been charged with aircraft as expected, but the margin development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed,&quot; Doerksen said in a client.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that new orders for Bombardier CSeries, if the testing program for the plane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, if in the coming months will be announced no new orders, then we expect that the market will be sceptical about the programme.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft the company can catapult into the lower segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test plane was presented to the public in March, after months of delays and flew for the first time in September.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flights and want to see whether the claims of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft is correct.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier his goal of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jets will achieve.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The company said on Thursday with analysts and the media, the program is on schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test aircraft remained on the ground is no longer than expected,&quot; said Beaudoin during a conference call and added, while the service life of the aircraft had been scheduled ground testing and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Each manufacturer is planning.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, which is what we have done.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This is happening during the entire flight programme.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test planes will be expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was said by the company.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, analysts remain sceptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight of the first customer for the CSeries aircraft in operation.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said that it check the planning for the operation (EIS) and will update this in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;The slow progress of the flight test - even if they are obviously Bombardiers internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 is shifting,&quot; Doerksen said.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter with Bombardiers end on September 30, net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The adjusted earnings per share of 9 cents, unchanged.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Sales slipped slightly after and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4,56 million expected, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Net orders fell by 83 aircraft at 26.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The order book in the aerospace division amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on September 30 and was unchanged compared with December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In the field of aerospace, the results in the context of our targets, but the low order intake and the market as a whole were disappointing,&quot; said Beaudoin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's biggest train manufacturer, announced that sales in this division by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The order book in the transport sector, on 30 September, amounted to $32.6 billion, compared with December 31, slightly increased.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which the tail is wagging the dog with his mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the cock stretched more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while the left side was nervous dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now, scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and be able to respond.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;When people are well aware that the left and right brain hemisphere respond differently to stimuli, causing the positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we have tried to look at this in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He also noticed that dogs, like humans, the speech for the movement of the left side was responsible and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs on the side of the tail is wagging their brethren, the researchers monitored the animals, while these films of other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the heart rate of the dog and analysed the behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Probably we will soon understand why the tail in one, in the other direction.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have shown the dogs movies with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette, in order to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to make the movement of the tail more control to the left or to the right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When they saw how an otherwise expression of loose dog the tail has moved to the right (from the perspective of the fronds of dog), they remained completely relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But was the tail tilt to the left (again, from the perspective of the dog, the wags), your heart rate rose and they saw restless.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the opinion of Professor Vallortigara, the dogs were not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learnt from experience, in which movements they worry if and when they are not.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He said: &quot;If you have several encounters with other dogs and the Wedeln with the cock in one direction rather with friendly behaviour and the right side is a less friendly behaviour, then it is on the basis of this experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal could help.</seg>
		<seg id="16">John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and Visiting Fellow at the Faculty of animal husbandry at the University of Bristol, said that this is not the first study, which has been investigated, whether on the left and right is important for dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln that dogs turn your head to the left, if they see an aggressive dog, and to the right, if it is a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada, said the following: &quot;Dogs tend to go on, if a robot dog, tail wag&quot; on the left and the right, rather than the other way around years - than in the Italian study. &quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to his statement could stir the differences so that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the films or the robot dogs are not as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study of how dogs react to real dogs, could help, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that both halves to be used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception,&quot; said Bradshaw.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But simply because their behaviour record, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes in one, sometimes in the other direction.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The reason is, however, no spider phobia, but the concern, at the age of the many steps to the house and in the apartment is no longer able to cope, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In addition, since one of the fifty Erin Meniskus-Operation has experienced what it means to deal with a handicap from floor to floor.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Recently she published a book on the subject of 'the tender age - What living form is the best for me?'.</seg>

		<seg id="11">As more than 20 years ago with her husband in the duplex apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.</seg>

		<seg id="5">Basharat form, 42, disappeared under the world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after looking through his own cocaine had been compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Kriminalisten as &quot;first class&quot; vaunted lawyer with the nickname &quot;Bash&quot; was arrested in his house in 2011, after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he represented in a previous drug procedures.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Officials observed how Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, parenting, while this with colleagues during a meal at the Bar.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The investigation brought to light that form of class A drugs regularly consumed after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards were found.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All four suspects were from the police as part of a major corporation to Heroin- and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Along with 32 other people were later arrested after the police during a series of raids heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Legally, 42, gave information to criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction cannot be known.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today, filling in for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice found guilty and sentenced.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He admitted at an earlier hearing to cocaine possession.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The lawyer was convicted after the police in their investigations against Scarborough found that this in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Turkey.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas House and the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove in the dustbin of the lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, called Scarborough regularly with Turkey, at dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer returned home, took drugs and then nine messages exchanged between the two.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In court, it became known that form a regular consumer of cocaine, after tests of Class A drugs in his hair, his wallet and credit cards were discovered.</seg>
		<seg id="20">L was later arrested but denied to take cocaine, and said that he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because this was his client, and claimed that their discussion is governed by the &quot;lawyer secret.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">During his arrest form took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they have been secured and he was taken from a hair sample.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He was in the police interrogation, both in his home and in the workplace, an office and clients it at home because of legal issues.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In court, it was announced that the major players in the drug trade, some of which he had earlier called for significant arrests and had informed about what the investigators knew about them.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;A criminal law should know better than anyone else that breaking the law.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Is this form of abuse of his position as defence lawyers accused, because he is too much with certain clients.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relationship is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.</seg>
		<seg id="29">He was the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr form brought his profession into disrepute.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he caused that his independence was compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Wrote, any wrongdoing, and said: &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait for 15 hours, but do it right away.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after the hearing, said superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire: &quot;Mr wrote, the step from a criminal to a criminal in the moment when he started to buy drugs from organised criminals.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">His cocaine addiction led to a desperate compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, which hired him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity and public trust and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="36">L has betrayed that trust and tries to get behind the façade of his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Turkey, in three cases to a conviction for possession of cocaine and obstructing justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This case should serve as a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and bring you to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison on the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade declared guilty.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Council is targeting tracks</seg>
		<seg id="1">The railway crossing &quot;Am Hirschen&quot; expenditure, in order to improve road safety?</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yes, the local councillors have decided.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Schiltach must EUR 220 000.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal-Bahnstrecke in the coming year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In particular the safety at level crossings be increased - it is regularly nationwide to collisions between trains with other vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The transformed into communities, they have to deal with a third of the cost, and the rest are divided.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Schiltachs city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the peculiarities of the Bahübergangs &quot;Am Hirschen.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">There is the city, in the amount of the tunnel mouth, west of the railway tracks to build a bulge.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There could also be more vehicles, for example, those who transported long timber at oncoming traffic, without having to block the tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Grießhaber proposed, to construct a retaining wall so that the city of the subsequent street could expand at the appropriate time, in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This was discussed in the council is controversial, since some councils need roads were spreading in doubt: Thomas tilt, saying the mood of the critics: &quot;Because we have so few cars so much money?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing Hirschen will regularly used for long wood shipments.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Even wood from the area &quot;Kuhbach&quot; will be transported via this route, in part because the vehicles of up to 20 metres long the route could use the Häberlesbrücke not because they could not turn in the road.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In addition, the track served as a diversion for those vehicles which are not allowed to use the tunnel, if the road is blocked, Haas.</seg>
		<seg id="15">As expected, that church and castle mountain tunnel rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing &quot;Am Hirschen for a longer period is an important traffic significance.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The Council agreed to investigate the costs of the proposed expansion of the street.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Despite this, the reconstruction of the railway crossing largely agreed with the proviso that the retaining wall will be built in such a way that the city of the subsequent road &quot;Bahnhofstrasse&quot; possibly for meeting traffic at around 5.5 m building.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The railway crossing in the tanning Trautwein, on the other hand, could be a quite different problem, which the access in the rising &quot;Geroltzhäuser way '.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The administration had the restructuring plans of the railway from the engineering study Breinlinger, because they had doubts about whether the planned end of Geroltzhäuser route will still be possible without further ado.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The study concluded that cannot be ruled out that the conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The responsibility for carrying the city as a road last winner.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Therefore, could the restructuring liability disputes.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Since both the collection and the turning in the current state of development should be worked, the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Henman argued.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Also at this point is the risk of a collision with a car on the transition are significantly lower than in the other rail crossings, because the next stop in the middle, a good sight.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even trains from the main railway station, this would have to be slowed down so far that there is no danger of a collision.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mostly, the reconstruction of this railway crossing denied the agreement, since the city Schiltach, the problem with aufsitzenden vehicles &quot;should suffer the consequences,&quot; according to the councils, as the train after the completion of the construction could withdraw from the responsibility.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The body is seen as the changes on the level crossings &quot;Before running&quot; and &quot;Before Kuhbach,&quot; for the intersection of agreements with the train.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Syria have facilities for the production of chemical weapons and Gitftgasmunition destroyed, explained the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while in the north of the country to heavy clashes near one of the sites, where suspected toxic substances are stored.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago had been killed.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the deadline</seg>
		<seg id="4">November 1, the organisation based in The Hague, Damascus had set all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons to destroy or &quot;were,&quot; including all the machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of the destruction, is an important milestone for an ambitious timetable, on the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by the middle of 2014.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The destruction of the institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Damascus has yet to begin, however, the existing weapons and to destroy stockpiles.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Estimates suggest that there are in the country and about 1,000 tonnes of chemical weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The announcement came at a time when fighting on Thursday took place in the town of Safira, experts say that there is a facility for chemical weapons production and storage facilities, such as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The activist group, which has a network of activists in Syria, the number of deaths, said on Thursday, 120.296 people have died.</seg>
		<seg id="11">These are 6.365 61.067 civilians, including children.</seg>
		<seg id="12">On the government side were 29.954 of them the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 are pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Also among the dead were 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of people killed in the conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This figure has not been updated.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The conflict has approximately two million people have been forced to flee the country.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Assad's troops for weeks in Safira fight against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The observatory said it voted on Thursday losses on both sides, but no details.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The fighting underscores the risk that are exposed to the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria's toxic arsenal is a race against time in the middle of a brutal civil war.</seg>
		<seg id="20">According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, is the team &quot;now convinced that all of these important production and mixing / filling equipment and has witnessed their destruction.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="22">At the beginning of the week, the inspectors said that they have completed the first round of checks and 21 out of 23 sites declared by Damascus.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Due to security concerns is the visit of two institutions would not have been possible, said the inspectors.</seg>
		<seg id="24">On Thursday, the OPWC, the two sites have been abandoned, according to the Syrian statement... &quot;and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme have been relocated to other indicated bodies that have been inspected.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions, which have not been able to visit the OPCW-Inspektoren.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, the next month, the Executive Committee of the OPWC must be approved.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: Grow up faster</seg>
		<seg id="1">African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty tend to be rather than their white age mates, studies show.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes mean not directly puberty</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones and other chemicals are responsible</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">The former CNN-Korrespondentin Pat Etheridge is a journalist who has specialised in child health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A mother should be concerned when her daughter at the age of seven or eight years to grow breasts and pubic hair?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics pediatricians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, said the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal under American girls and a new standard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time to reassure parents - usually there is no indication that quickly puberty occurs,&quot; explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, Scham- and Achselhaare and body odor, show up in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarche (first menstruation) in the last 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age for 12.5 years, slightly less than visual in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;If the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to Menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this often occurs.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test, such as puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is controversial, which is actually the start of puberty, but &quot;precocious&quot; if the breast of a growth spurt before the age of eight years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process is slowed down or stagnating - something that a doctor can monitor closely.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For faster progress could be displayed by a Endikronologen tests, so that serious problems such as cysts or tumors can be excluded.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: The early aging of the bones, the strong growth inhibition and small stature in adults.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The recommendations for a medication or hormonal therapy based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is sceptical about drugs, but he admits: &quot;The suppression of puberty can conduct problems and mitigate the feelings of girls, unlike their age mates.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other major problem is understandable: Parents would simply not that their very young daughters of the period.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They are concerned because of the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman whose daughter with ten of their days.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even if there were signs and we had spoken about menstruation, she was not prepared for it emotionally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She was scared and excited home from school, because it was the first in her group of friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be eliminated.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Young girls are similar to early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz is of the opinion that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He was conducting a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which is a connection between body fat and entering puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country tend to African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty earlier than their white age mates.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations for this.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Global seems an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions on the climate to the genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another mystery: Although boys face and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors on the AAP-Konferenz underscored the complexity of the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The emergence of acne and pubic hair is even in infants and young children.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We have to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to advice from their doctor, how they should talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;It may mean that you can carry on a conversation earlier than expected,&quot; advised Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you remain calm, the child is usually good.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls, early bloom, need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it happens earlier than expected.</seg>

		<seg id="2">But the opening statement before the Commission had the YMCA stated that it was &quot;never in the organization with an incident of sexual abuse had to do.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee indicted for crimes involving child pornography, and another in which a teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 because of the abuse he had been sentenced to deal with children.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistance, a lawyer that he warned of the first case, the second but not before.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA in relation to the Commission is also inaccurate in the claim, &quot;it was external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA as at the forefront of child safety has been recognised.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Evidence of the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he was the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (2002) in August of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hare, with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the company had &quot;from me downwards&quot; in the recruitment of Lord failed and not to ensure that employees are aware of their obligations and infringement of the directives on child safety.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Lord was the beginning of the year because of sexual assaults against 12 boys during his two years of activity for the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem, the employees have prevented from Lords violations in relation to the safety of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The staff said that they had seen violations, among other things, that Lord alone with children, she worked as a babysitter, she was sitting on his lap, said that he was delighted, and children play with his mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, whose boss Lord and asked for a training on child protection, because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the children's services director Jacqui Barnat, the YMCA Caringbah, a Lords was &quot;very intimidating and most of the time was very remote.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The manager said that he would not accept employees said that they had not dared to report to their superiors.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Instead, he said, but their friendship with Lord impair their judgment, which is why they have not spoken to him.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hare said that he was the executive board of the YMCA NSW shared his view that the lesson that the organization &quot;Jonathan-Lord-Zwischenfall,&quot; &quot;according to the report&quot; by staff, and the board voted in favour.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Hare said that the decision, the staff to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations, is the managing director of children's services, Liam Whitley, the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said that it should be to prevent contamination of the evidence, but &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The YMCA NSW is the time when Jonathan Lord between 2009 and 2011, there had been no children safe organisation, said Professor Stephen Small bone of the Griffith University, an expert on child sex abuse, the Commission.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">It's a new day, a new horror story to independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and secured with barbed wire along the border of Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In fact, in the Strathclyde-Vorlage pointed to the potential economic benefits, the greater freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but it was - as expected - in the headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Also, nobody has mentioned that the EU Member States often bent their strict rules, if it is cheaper for them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As Scotland is currently not in the Schengen area, would be the continued disregard for Brussels only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So, in fact, no story.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And one that has been so in the years to come is that it is already a fossil like: The first time I have the &quot;independence means&quot; -Ente passport controls at least 40 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is an interesting point in the constant repetition of this ancient history.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that after the European pipe dances?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why the London's yoke, against the trade from Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">These are the real European news: The large, taken after the war plan for the unification of Europe is faltering.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Throughout the EU parties gaining ground, the EU-feindlich or the euro as a common currency would like to throw.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany, founded this year - nearly five million votes in the general election in September and effectively for the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There has been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Because of the Berlin and the European Central Bank has imposed strict austerity measures in connection with the straitjacket in which the national economy by adhering to the single currency will be obliged, many people are of the opinion that the European project has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments can cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned down its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters - and the German politicians would like.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe with a built-in productivity in part to Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only way is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the current Etat- and currency problems lies a more profound European productivity problem.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of the imposed by Brussels &quot;green&quot; energy directives - a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer pays the European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four for gas.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have seen already in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All wage system in the world to protect the European petrochemical industry, of cheap US shale gas to be pushed into a corner.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result, a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle to Germany and Paris could stand on an equal footing with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin and Paris is no longer as a gateway to the political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which the ailing French economy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-feindlicher Front National has just won a decisive choice and the ruling Socialists at number three.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party, that they should not assume that a split on the right wing would automatically mean benefits for the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen with their newly won popularity among the white working class people?</seg>
		<seg id="33">You would like to use the European elections next year, a Anti-EU-, Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the opposition parties do well in these elections - and it is very possible, then, for the first time, the European Parliament is such a block.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency is the abolition of the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it will be something like the &quot;Europe of sovereign nations,&quot; the General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect that Britain distanced himself from this project in the hope to curry favour with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain alone in the Atlantic rain.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Where is Scotland in all this?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can decide, a region of (ultimately) small England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests - including, Berlin and Brussels to say what they are where hinstecken.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland could be a looser Europe go quite well, as long as we keep our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other like-minded countries, is not in a federal Europe of Nations easier.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should consider it Norway and keep our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and won) cuts made to the Labour-Finanzminister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition had to answer for.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous for Scotland, is now to decide on independence, only to then from Berlin and Brussels imposed austerity.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but no phone conversations)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Passengers can now from departure to arrival their electronic devices to read, work, games, listening to music and watching movies, but not with the mobile phones, so the new directives on Thursday from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that these changes will be implemented immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly they were implemented, the respective airline, FAA-Mitarbeiter Michael Huerta said at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft meet the new guidelines and training manuals for pilots and as well as the rules for the settling of the devices have updated according to the new rules.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said it had already received from some airlines plans, the use of portable electronic devices on planes to develop.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Under these airlines, including Delta and JetBlue.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the state of the plan, we could have the expanded use of electronic devices allow very soon,&quot; the FAA in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers need to smartphones, tablets and other devices, when the doors are closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">You may then start again, when the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain has given the green light.</seg>
		<seg id="10">When entering the final approach, passengers need to disable them and they are not allowed to start again, before the plane landed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to the new guidelines could airlines whose aircraft against electronic malfunctions were secured to allow their passengers, the devices during take-off, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most of the new commercial aircraft and other planes for the use of Wi-Fi in greater heights have been converted, should meet the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the Association of professional cabin crew, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;If the new regulation will be implemented - and in this regard, we are working closely together with the airline, will benefit both sides,&quot; said Glading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We are tired of it, to be honest, we feel on this issue as a watchdog.</seg>
		<seg id="16">However, Internet surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading data at three kilometres, explained the authority.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers are asked to smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Still no &quot;Words With Friends,&quot; which recalls the Scrabble online game, the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he was a high profile of American Airlines jet had to leave because he refused to turn off the device, while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stowed, because there is a risk of injury if they are flying through the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mobile phone calls during the flight is also still remain banned.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The regulatory competence for calls for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA sets may ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the Transportation Security Administration National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national transport on CBS News, mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Mobile is really a problem, not only because they potentially could cause disruptions in GPS system, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air also can interfere with radio masts,&quot; Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The industry an Advisory Committee, which the FAA to investigate this issue was launched last month, recommended that the government to allow wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years has increased the pressure on the FAA, restrictions on its use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri, take the view that there is no valid reasons for the ban.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions are also increasingly difficult because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In some studies, says that up to a third of the passengers of the closure of the unit forgotten or ignored.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA began in 1966, the use of electronic devices by passengers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices of passengers UKW-Radios agencies had become known, at the time, the latest technology trends.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they represent anything electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines offer passengers for a number of years ago, when the ground is achieved.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The Wi-Fi systems adapted planes are also less susceptible to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of passenger aircraft for the greater use of electronic devices will be suitable for the new directives, Huerta said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices, in general, much less phone radiation than previous generations.</seg>
		<seg id="36">For example, only minimal radiation if umblättert.</seg>
		<seg id="37">However, when downloading or sending data transfer values.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among the supporters of a loosening of restrictions on the use by passengers is Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">2011 invited employee airliner full of Kindle rumours and made a test flight in order to identify problems, but could not say.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the FAA-Beratungskomitees expressed mixed feelings about what the risk involved in the use of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from the passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the view that the disruption of the equipment is real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other committee members said that there were only scattered reports of pilots for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">However, the committee recommended that the FAA, the pilots to land in poor visibility conditions for instruments of the closure of units by the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, describing it as a reasonable accommodation for travellers who extensively with technology today.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a passenger experience is not in contradiction with the security,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="6">&quot;The protection of as many cultivated land is the goal,&quot; says Häußler.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is based on the design of the protection against a according to the German weather service statistically every 100 years to expected flooding.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Climate change is a 15% surcharge.</seg>

		<seg id="11">&quot;There is not an absolute protection, but we can reach a relative improvement,&quot; says Häußler.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Between leading aircraft manufacturers, it is to be a debate about the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute revolves around the seat width, the passengers on long-haul flights in economy class is offered - not always those that most airlines, but the designated area is the key to the effectiveness of allegations in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for an industry standard, a minimum width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the economy, but the American competetive Boeing says airlines should decide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft are vying to even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range aircraft to sell, and the event from 17 to 21 November record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As the rear part of the aircraft is fleshed out - especially if it ranks with nine or ten seats - is crucial to the economic results, the new Mini Jumbo &quot;design to deliver.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing said that its new &quot;777X&quot; shall be 406 people in economy class seats, which are about 17 inches wide and ten per series.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus said that the competing version of the A350 car 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in economy class, and there are nine per series.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Share aircraft giants often blows on technical details via advertising in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now, Airbus calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Recently, the company unveiled an ad, which is the beginning of a new ad war could and donors a picture, in which three people squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: &quot;Would you accept that?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing is proposing long haul flights in seats that are more closely than regional Turbo-Props,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In light of changed eating habits will people be thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years increased by 10%, so the data of the US-Gesundheitsministeriums.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Taillenumfang of the male average American in the 21st century, according to US health statistics 100,8 cm.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus says that his rival to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of newly baptized &quot;Jet Set&quot; narrow.</seg>
		<seg id="16">We have, as Airbus, investigations showed that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat by 53 percent raises the sleep quality.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus to the seat sizes and says that it is not up to the manufacturer to decide how the balance between airlines and air fares.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The company also said, according to surveys, the experience in the plane for more than the minimum width.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It is really to airlines to provide flexibility, so that they can do what they believe they need to be successful,&quot; explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">You do not want to dictate to them what they are.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers, it's about more elbow for manufacturers, but it is increasingly an issue that can impact on the sales.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion dollars at catalogue prices in the coming decades, as heavily on the export performance of the United States or Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters reported for the first time in July, is the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing say 20 percent more efficient per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The statements by Boeing on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X, with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The increased cost per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Boeing squeezes more seats on his plane, in order to make our products more competitive,&quot; says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort in the European Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, say analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777 indicated that many passengers for closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;18 inch seat width would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer from the threat of the 777 controlled,&quot; says Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin no direction, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing have no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The world travelers Jet-Verkäufer carry tape measure, the creation of the competition and gherkins.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Even if they offer the comfort dressing, but all manufacturers also jets with hochverdichteter design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers a A350 with ten rows of seats, but has not as yet.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus has emphasised the importance of greater adaptability of cabins and some Jets wide seats in the corridors.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fizzle, but from the wave of 777X-Verkäufen could distract.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Veganism is emerging as the vegetarianism, differs from this but in a very significant way.</seg>
		<seg id="1">For vegetarians, the consumption of cream cake, ice or a strong Edam, they are not on the menu of a Veganers.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegans from all the consumption of animal products - including honey is denied.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What, you may wonder, but on closer examination, the vegan nutrition world by a considerable ingenuity.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Sandwich spreads are very popular,&quot; says Ute Henkel man, the owner of the local reform House, which has a variety of special products for vegans.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Reuben London also visited the store in the Domgasse.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For 13 years, the native New Zealanders vegan lives in (almost) everything he finds what he needs to live. &quot;In 1997, I was in my diet and vegetarian.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">At the turn of the century, then took the next step and I was vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;The conviction but not only because of the food, but because of the shoe choice,&quot; says London, the artificial normal leather.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He acknowledged that there are also other everyday issues without animal products.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First and foremost, be vegan is an ethics.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I do not want that animals have to die for me,&quot; says protecting the maxim of vegans, who on the whole consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Instead of burgers, Rühreiern or rubber bears mourn after, the vegans quickly discovered a completely new products, which increased enthusiasm.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;It is a double bonus,&quot; says London today, &quot;be vegan actually represents a waiver, no prayer, but it is an asset.&quot; The assumption that the changes to the selection of dining options, London and more on the power of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And these conditions also had some even well-intentioned attempt fail.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The addictive is a crucial factor that leaves many give up quickly, similar to smoking,&quot; scorched-earth is a comparison.</seg>
		<seg id="16">And: &quot;Certain tastes are not depending on the animal.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">Often it is the spices or the type of preparation, which make up the taste.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;But it is also in a different way to produce the same effect,&quot; says the vegans.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For example, at a barbecue, protecting such as aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He takes on a balanced, varied diet, and taste the dishes.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Of course, we would like to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;It should taste, but it is not only to reduce animal food,&quot; says London.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Damage to health and eating disorders, another widespread adoption, he did not.</seg>
		<seg id="24">For me, the transition was a positive aspect.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I take no foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are high performance athletes, which only vegan diet.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;My blood values are well, I am often check,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warn many Vegansimus-Kritiker.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;As animals fed with feed, rather than on the pasture to graze, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer, Vitamin-B12-Anteil is high,&quot; scorched-earth takes place.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For vegans, there is also the possibility that the products in the form of tablets.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;My B12-Werte are in order,&quot; he explains.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Long distances should realize for the food supply.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Finally, there are basic foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket has now soya milk and other products.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Everything I need, I think.</seg>
		<seg id="35">And I buy something special.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that applies to&quot; ordinary &quot;finished products as well.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="37">In any case, the preparation of our dishes are much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;In the restaurant, there is a lot to discover, with a few small tips can be good, if not better results, in part,&quot; says London.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake could realize his in-laws to delight.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Strictly vegan gives a new condiment.</seg>
		<seg id="41">The dynamics when you cook together, has a new significance.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;The situations that can arise, are as diverse as the people themselves,&quot; says London.</seg>
		<seg id="43">He was, of course, but also scepticism prevails.</seg>
		<seg id="44">My food tastes you no longer?</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;Now I feel bad because I drink milk?&quot; - the kind of questions you should act as vegans with sensitivity.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;I reject the people do not, I am part of this society,&quot; Proctor would not enclaves.</seg>
		<seg id="47">And then examined the everyday world is not vegan as suspects - and the vegan is not restricted in everyday life, as is commonly believed.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Even fast food is allowed.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Fries everywhere!</seg>
		<seg id="50">&quot;Many Döner delis, falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka,&quot; says London.</seg>
		<seg id="51">He is in a pizzeria on pasta, or order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="52">The restaurants are so slow.</seg>
		<seg id="53">&quot;When I started 13 years ago, I have to eat vegan, everything was much more difficult,&quot; the New Zealanders can find a development: &quot;You talk to people, they point out.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="54">&quot;If sufficient demand, perhaps they are inclined to complement the menu,&quot; he hopes.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café bird.</seg>
		<seg id="56">London has the desire that other restaurants at least a 08 dish on the menu.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Basically, there are vegan dishes for everyone.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Everyone can eat them, so they are precisely the opposite of exclusively.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Meat are not exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they are different,&quot; Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way for the most part, to make impossible from the outset,&quot; says London.</seg>
		<seg id="61">But the purchase vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Especially when you learn to understand that color additives in animal farming donors may be included, it seems to comply with the ethics with so many hurdles and traps the courage to leave.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Not only have therefore Reuben London and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: &quot;Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives,&quot; explains the many ingredients, food and cleaning products are buried.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot;And we developed a scanner and know what signs and logos to respect you,&quot; It is sometimes better than small steps to stop or stumble, &quot;London.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Veganism, he is an important moral signal that the awareness.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Perhaps he is not quite that his habits, but at least he can teach consumers, his habits.</seg>

		<seg id="0">New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill the pleasure of smoking</seg>
		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which could spoil the fun of smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A single dose of the vaccine in mice could protect against a lifetime of smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In tests on humans are still needed further trials, which can last for a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop all methods available in the market have tried, but had discovered that their smoking is stronger than these approaches,&quot; said Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was changed so that the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus selective the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies hunting the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker no nicotine High.</seg>

		<seg id="3">With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi was also the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world, and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He presented the oath before the 18 dressed in black robes, the judges of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile and an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, 60 years in the United States, a trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, since its founding in 84 years mostly as a banned organisation of the respective government sharply had been targeted.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building, as Morsi shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small car convoy arrived.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court, the new president zuzujubeln, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak era, the traffic was stopped for a short time, so that the car convoy was able to cross the busy street in the city centre, with the southern suburbs.</seg>

		<seg id="16">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in the Tahir-Platz, the birthplace of the uprising last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers, by the turn of the head of state.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But with the passing of the official oath before the court and not, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the wishes of the military, which shows that the power struggle will continue.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans, up to 100 dollars from passengers who want to stow luggage on their flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines intends, up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or soda, even if in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers would keep the whole box.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new charge will apply to bags in the overhead baggage compartment on the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said that establish 25 dollars, if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 for passengers who pay at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Frontier-Sprecherin Kate O'Malley said the fee of $100 is introducing travelers to move to the payment in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We want to calculate this sum,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines began in 2008, for the first and second checked bag fees.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers who tried to bypass it, have therefore filled in your hand luggage as much as possible, with the result that the baggage compartments above the headquarters are often full to overflowing.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees are a way to make passengers less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'Malley said the new fee is not really about money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It was about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to place in the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers carrying your tickets on the website of the airline, do not have to pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier may be allowed to carry one bag for free, but the next person 100 dollars on a comparable piece.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'Malley said that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed, so that passengers be informed about the fee before they come to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only come into force in the summer, a precise date, there are not.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Rail passengers often on baggage fees and other charges, but airlines are like.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that the transportation of the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service, if they wanted it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street, the new baggage charges as a sign that the airlines have enough money, after years of losses to cover the cost of air travel.</seg>
		<seg id="19">So far, however, most of them the finger of charges for hand luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Asked Spirit Airlines Inc. three years ago, the first to charge for hand luggage, and later followed all the Giant Air, a low-cost carriers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely followed the charges.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit equals $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, who previously held a senior position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit, and was curious as to what he would expect at the gate when passengers with the unusual hand baggage fee would be facing the company.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The boarding process was one of the most in my career, I have seen in the aviation industry,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The Foreign Secretary also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama bore the responsibility that you have placed on &quot;autopilot&quot; when the explosive revelations of which had about the spying activities of the NSA publicly.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The leaked information is the U.S. government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In a speech broadcast via video link on the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: &quot;There is no question but that the President and I and others in the government of some things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so, even in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, goes back to the events of 11 September.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Then he acknowledged as the first high-ranking member of the US government that the US-Spionage crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights have been abused.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Distant worlds.</seg>
		<seg id="4">More than 1,000 planets in other stars, astronomers have already been found.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Whether there is life on at least some of them, nobody knows.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The selection is difficult: Should we search for gravitational waves?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Or do you prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life?</seg>
		<seg id="9">These questions are the leaders of the European Space Agency (Esa.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For its program &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; looking for ideas for two major space projects, the research is crucial.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The budget for such &quot;L-Missionen&quot; is about a billion euros.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At the beginning of September, met in Paris, the elite of the European space research, in order to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">30 ideas were on the table, five of them are now in the final round.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Many bodies to examine the proposals, tick the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the next few days, a final decision by the scientific program committee.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A total of four major issues has selected the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 programme initiated &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; to find answers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?</seg>
		<seg id="19">The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that orbit stars - are still in the proverbial dark.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And if a star planet, under what circumstances can create life?</seg>
		<seg id="22">To investigate this question, the space telescope in 2017, &quot;unlike&quot; to start, with the 500 already known planetary systems in our area to be examined in detail.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the opportunities are limited, Khufu is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With larger instruments astronomers could step planet and analyse the composition of their atmospheres and search for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: Gases, as an indicator for biological activity.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How does the solar system?</seg>
		<seg id="26">This question is, ultimately, what conditions for the emergence of life.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Plays an important role in the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from him with the star.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In our solar system are examples of these events.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The Solar Orbiter &quot;the Esa is already a mission of the series (this is where the budget at around half a billion euros) for this question.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The probe is going to start in 2017 and finish and activity of the sun.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Of great interest to researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.</seg>
		<seg id="32">You want to find out what the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system.</seg>
		<seg id="33">This is the Esa is the first of the three L-Missionen of &quot;cosmic vision&quot; programme.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The probe &quot;juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy moons Explorer) begins its journey to 2022.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Eight years later, she reached Jupiter and the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa and Ganymede, wiser.</seg>
		<seg id="36">What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?</seg>
		<seg id="37">The space offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws we know there are still valid.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Perhaps the physicists, the path to a new theory could indicate that comprises all known laws of nature.</seg>
		<seg id="39">What is the universe and what is it?</seg>
		<seg id="40">In our universe 13.7 billion years from the Big Bang.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In addition to the daily material from which stars, planets and life as we are, there are dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, which is speeding up the expansion of the universe.</seg>
		<seg id="42">So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws in the first fractions of a valid from the Big Bang, nor what dark matter, dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="43">With &quot;Euclid,&quot; the Esa also has already approved a M-Mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With a special telescope to probe the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, investigate and provide information on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Who could make this race</seg>
		<seg id="46">Of the 30 proposals at the end of the selection process, only two remain.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The best chance of a Bewilligung as L-mission, according to many experts &quot;E-Lisa,&quot; an ambitious concept for the detection of gravitational waves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time, the Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="49">It has not been proven.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Elisa could hope to achieve this, the scientists behind the project.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The mission is one of two or three probes existing detector, which is deployed in space.</seg>
		<seg id="52">It could, in contrast to sites around the world, evidence of gravitational waves, which are the Big Bang, and new insights into the origin of the cosmos.</seg>
		<seg id="53">Four other proposals still compete for the second L-mission: A large X-ray telescope named &quot;Athena,&quot; which will explore, among other things, would investigate black holes, &quot;Icy Planets,&quot; another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism,&quot; a mission to survey the cosmic radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder,&quot; the first step is to identify and investigate the planet.</seg>
		<seg id="54">Among other proposals are already resigned to Proben-Rücktransport from Mars, for the study of the moon, Venus and Earth and the solar physics.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down in his oft-repeated, clear promises: &quot;If you like your insurance, you can keep it.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of resignation, Republicans cast the president in recent days that he had misled the American public.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yesterday, Obama watered down his original promise.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals Obama called for those Americans who have received such messages, on the open market for a new insurance.</seg>

		<seg id="7">&quot;You get a better offer,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population, who themselves have an insurance, should look for another rate, since the Treaty does not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Parents of sexual children can choose &quot;gender undetermined.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany is the first European nation, in which a third gender is recognised for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Newborn will no longer rigidly male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Under the new law, parents have no sex more for those children, but &quot;undecided&quot; or &quot;not fixed&quot; on the birth certificate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents, so that they do not make any hasty decisions relating to operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and the people of sexual discrimination.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A internationell sexual person said, according to BBC years later: &quot;I am neither man nor woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I remain the mess that has been created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">An estimated one in 2,000 children each year, either as a boy or a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They belong to the sexual, a group that fall under the diagnosis &quot;sexual differentiation disorder&quot; (DSD), an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genital mutilation.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson was perhaps the sexually.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but the majority of experts in the United States, we should have the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not on the psychological and physical development of children wait before you - if at all - for an operation to decide.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, on the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law &quot;sounds like a good thing.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Inter sexual children are an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but for most children, this is not true,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can make a sex allocation without surgery and then wait and see how the identity of morality.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The scientific data on how a child's gender identity at all, are not very closely.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one knows why it happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In a report to the European Commission in 2011, it says, sexual people are transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not sex, but by their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female exclusively, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These properties were subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structure and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination which inter sexual and transgender people face in the workplace and on the level of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Not with the Equality image matching boys now have a special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It is now in Australia and Nepal for adults, on official documents male, female or &quot;third gender.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52), the world's first &quot;loose&quot; person after a court recognised the lifelong maintaining a &quot;fixed&quot; gender status was granted.</seg>
		<seg id="24">German cards alongside M and W will have a third assignment, X for sexually, the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighbouring France gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">2011 signed dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country a petition that the 'gender theory &quot;should be removed from textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The Web site Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, saying: &quot;If the world is being dragged into a new state, where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two other pillars of civilisation.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">The mother of a newborn in Maryland told baby zone, they think it would be better if babies at birth is assigned to one gender.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;The parents existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you are not the sex of your child knows,&quot; she said of the parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and security.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, the children were with both male and female sex parts were born, known as Hermaphroditen, after the Greek god of both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ten years ago, the medicine was the sex as something you could wipe out and then rebuild.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation in doubt, now that we know how complex the gender identity, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child growing up with their assigned gender.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;In the middle of the twentieth century, called this a&quot; psychiatric emergency, &quot;said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If such a child was born, then they called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals is Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, which is considered the sex.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental initiatives - such as the parents of a child educate-interacted with the genes and hormones and a child so as to whether a person is male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in the &quot;John / Joan&quot; case from 1966 his theories have been controversial.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, to neuter the child and also to remove his testicles and then bring up as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but he was not,&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married to a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">With 38 but he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">According to Drescher, there are still doctors who practice this model.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, are survivors of those sex operations to the public, &quot;not happy with the result.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such as Jim Bruce, a 36 year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY-männlichen chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The doctors were not made clear whether he has a large clitoris or had a small penis and were convinced that he could never be a &quot;satisfactory life&quot; as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So its external body and shortly after birth the testicles surgically removed in 1976, and he was brought up as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">At the age of 12, he was awarded female hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I am not a girl,&quot; he said on ABCNews.com</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he found was shocking.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was at my birth sterile - and nobody has ever said to me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a DSD, through his body not enough testosterone to the development of the genitals could produce.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After he had learned the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received Testosteron-Injektionen and was to remove his breasts.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The operation, he has become infertile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, he is fighting for others in an organisation called Interface Project that inter sexual people perceived as normal.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of rights group based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law &quot;for stamping and encourage Basque.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child, not to&quot; set, &quot;she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We fear that favours intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait and see.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we still do not know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis said that their organisation to support the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults recognition as a third sex.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex to meet,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law relates to the allocation of childbirth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This is not a fight that small children should force at this time.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, they themselves can decide on their bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast Radio login from Pitt, a daughter with a sexual differentiation disruption, and hundreds of others in a support group, says that the German law &quot;authorize&quot; both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Baratz's daughter Katie, who was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistenz.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because of the faulty receptor cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">This is Katie 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a researcher in child psychiatry.</seg>
		<seg id="74">While it is barren, hopes, however, through the adoption of a child or a surrogate mother.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents room, where they don't have to make decisions in haste,&quot; Baratz said.</seg>
		<seg id="76">It gives them the time, various tests and to clarify things and gives them time, before they &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; writing.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this way, everything is in order, the child and loves it.</seg>
		<seg id="78">We have a wonderful baby and the parents.</seg>
		<seg id="79">And we must not rush to carry out an operation that can no longer be undone.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;That includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are concerned, because they believe that they would not do the right thing,&quot; she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Finally, the child decides on the sex, the more suitable for him - and this is wonderful.</seg>
		<seg id="82">This will enable children to take the decision itself.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in the car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">American road planners are looking for a source of money to the decaying highway system repair, and believe the solution in a small black box to the dashboard of the car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, which each mileage record and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the agencies of the federal states, the outdated system for financing American roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The normally rather boring field of road planning suddenly has an intense debate with colourful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarian have allied with environmental groups and support for the government of the small boxes for recording the mileage - and possibly even where they were driven - and then use the information for the calculation of tax modest.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Tea Party is horrified.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and a series of data protection issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But while in Congress could not agree on an approach, several states wait no longer.</seg>
		<seg id="8">You are currently examining how it over the next ten years to move to a system in which drivers pay per mile travelled.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of drivers have a tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring, have already been tested.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This really is a must for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There is nothing that we may use only,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of governments, which is a record of driving miles on all California motorists in the state in 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The way in which we pay these taxes will change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxation, the Americans pay at the pump, broke.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But in America will no longer needs as much as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars that consume less fuel.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased in 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians do not dare to high fuel prices, the tax by a penny.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The economy is simply not sustainable,&quot; says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His state has recently 500 cars equipped with a black box, with which a miles based payment system to be tested.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;This is the best option in the long term,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Bureaucrats call it miles based user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, the way to reduce congestion and greenhouse gases.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Californian designers rely on the system for the preparation of strategies with which the ambitious, legally binding objectives of the state of climate change are to be achieved.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he is the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The free marketer of the Reason Foundation are fond of the idea, drivers pay according to a pre-arranged route.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not a tax, which disappear into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at the Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The people directly pay for what they get.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also supported by two former American ministers who, in a report in 2011 had urged Congress to move towards miles based billing.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Last year, the Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project, which includes 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the majority in the House of Representatives hindered the thrust and thereby responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas represent the people who, on a daily basis, often many miles on the way to work or have to travel into the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several states and cities move nonetheless, on his own initiative in this direction.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most active forum is Oregon, which currently 5,000 driver for the country's largest experiment being recruited.</seg>
		<seg id="34">This will soon be the mileage fees instead of paying tax to the state.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has already completed a pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="36">New York City also is considering such a.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It is testing ziibi limited with trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95-Koalition, the departments of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices, motorists were sceptical of the idea that the government could track their movements.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,&quot; explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and product management at the Department of Transportation of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">People wanted to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When the trial started, warned the ACLU of Nevada on their website: &quot;It would be relatively easy, the tachograph to turn adult monitoring devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need for a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used, data on the daily movements of individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of a number of states, which are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.</seg>
		<seg id="46">So, as Khan, would also be confident the public.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The pursuit of this technology has some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The company is not originally for states in the field of taxation on motorists to help.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Rather, it was their aim, in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers pay based on miles driven.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices are tested for the road planners are interesting because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information regularly via modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People are more willing to participate if their speed and location not be recorded,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">In some of these public pilot programmes were made big mistakes.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement it.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, the planners that motorists are experimenting with a number of choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">You can opt for a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they take absolutely no device and instead pay a flat rate based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state driven miles.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Others hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public to equip devices with more functions than with little.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York City, transport officials want to develop a device for taxation, which is also pay parking, insurance only for driving distances must be paid and speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists with the added value of the benefits the system offers, motivated to participate,&quot; says a planning document of the city.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some traffic planners wonder, however, whether all the talk about the pay per mile is not just a huge red herring.</seg>
		<seg id="61">The Metropolitan Transportation Commission on the territory of the San Francisco Bay, officials said, Congress, the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing the tax on fuel.</seg>
		<seg id="62">An additional fee or an annual tax could motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume less fuel, so that they pay a fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no reason for an operation, but is also an aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislative and public affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy, and many other things.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, in a rare public demonstration commemorating the call for peace.</seg>

		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and RENAMO, which is one of the worst battles since the peace agreement, over 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It was once a notorious rebel movement RENAMO, which was initially ruled from White Rhodesia, and later the apartheid government of South Africa, in an effort to support the independent government to destabilise the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After the peace agreement of 1992, it has become an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts consider it unlikely that the country back into a full-scale conflict back the case, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For the rapidly growing economy is a lot at stake, since the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the northwest over the next few years, could investment of over 50 billion dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US into the country.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling Frelimo-Partei, the dominant force since 1975, and RENAMO are blaming each other for the tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">RENAMO claims that the Government had provoked the recent clashes, on October 17, by its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, attacked.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo-Stützpunkte and tried to kill, Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the group, said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government is RENAMO blamed for the clashes and accuses the organization, soldiers attacked.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">With AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regard themselves as &quot;losers&quot; who &quot;all his remaining forces, in order to prove that he can impose on the government's decisions.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="16">But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that the peace agreement of 1992 RENAMO.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Compared to the FT, he said that he had said that the agreement was no longer Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and it seriously,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Previous talks between the parties have not helped to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year have been fired.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;Here we have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who heads collide,&quot; says Joseph'Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mosambik-Experte.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">RENAMO, which is pushing for electoral reform, has already stated that it will boycott the elections in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have the use of violence as an attempt to ailing movement interpreted, concessions and financial benefits from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Shrink Renamos electoral success since 1992, during a recent party, which was founded by a former Renamo-Mitglied Movimento respectively de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mazanga said that Guebuza - whose resignation when his second term ends next year, the democracy of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want a transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give up the presidency,&quot; says Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear what capacity RENAMO, but it has been disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south links.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, Beira, however, the port, the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio a month suspended the use of the railways after RENAMO is an attack on the track.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether RENAMO will repeat that threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">&quot;RENAMO wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability have increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people were already due to corruption and the slow progress in the development and a recent kidnapping wave.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well stocked and debt knows the administration since 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The year 2012 can be booked as an unqualified success.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This was during the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As Andrea Roth mouth explained, is the administrative budget, with about 7.6 million euros over a million euros higher than planned.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The surplus of the administrative budget bed with some 1.8 million euros, roughly a million euros on the approach.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Thanks to the surplus is mainly higher commercial tax revenue and the share of income tax.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The capital budget was clear about the planned values.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Instead of the proposed EUR 1.5 million last year, it was EUR 2.5 million.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;This is largely due to the higher feed from the administrative budget,&quot; says Roth.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As for the financial year 2012 less than planned investments have been made, the reserve is also feeding higher.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says that Obama has the laudable efforts of the blocking tactics by Republicans had been thwarted</seg>
		<seg id="3">The policy does not apologise Website-Probleme of blood, the drone attacks</seg>
		<seg id="4">Obama's memoir on the election campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been possible</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I read a terribly sad book.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a book of which I have believed that it would be sad to me during the second year of my medical degree wit and give me hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; (courage) and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In the evening, when I finished with my patients record and go to bed, then this book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions and speeches will take your breath away.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election was a landslide and for adults, spokesman for the historic importance of this moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionaries was on her way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">When Obama went into office in 2008, he had approval values of 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Switch back to the present is a rude awakening, as if from a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a faint memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years since I made my voice for the first time, really has changed.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But it's just not what I imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved by the adoption of the burden for health insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I, too, am of the opinion that the political block too many efforts have overturned, with which our nation forward: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after countless times the Obama administration to colleagues and friends, I am trying my statement at the end.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I have reached a point of political desperation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Republican blocking tactics cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It does not explain why the National Security Agency data about the private lives of Americans collect and why whistleblowers should be punished, disclose wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It does not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was killed without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It does not justify the findings of a report, which states that the efforts of the White House to keep the media are the &quot;most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And did it cannot excuse the failure, in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act to create a simple Web site.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I do not know whether this is what I would have expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If I had to understand that the government of the previous political campaigns could disagree.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Obviously, the Abgeordnetenamt no predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown-Massaker shape the public debate.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But when I look at the above examples, then they seem largely by the government itself to be elected.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And that bothers me the most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I have chosen Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed to define its direction and positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope that we have heard for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But with a decline in the ratings for Obama to below 45% this week is a return to 2008 through this book to become even harder.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In a meeting with the electoral agents after the decision, he told his staff, they have to come back on track and the purpose of their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want us to find the magic,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We have to remember who we are.</seg>
		<seg id="42">There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree with you more.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>
