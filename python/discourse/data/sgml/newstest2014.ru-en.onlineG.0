		<seg id="0">Manufacturers of jet aircraft are about the width of the seat, when the stake large orders</seg>
		<seg id="1">Between the leading aircraft manufacturers, a bitter dispute erupted over the width of the seat tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a violent confrontation at the Dubai air show this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute revolves around the width of the seat provided on long-haul flights, passengers of economy class, whose interests are not always in the center of attention of airlines, while the amount of allocated space plays a key role in making statements about the efficiency of the last aircraft offered Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for the industry standard, which would seat width of not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in the salons of economy class, but its main American rival Boeing says that this should be decided by the airline.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft producers compete in sales of larger and larger versions of their twin-engine aircraft, and the event 17-21 November are expected to potentially record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The layout of the rear part of the plane, sit whether 9 or 10 people in a row, occupies a Central place in the statements about the economic effectiveness of new projects «mini-Airbus».</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing says its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people on the basis of the seats in economy class for more than 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says that a competing version of its A350 will be transported in economy class seats 350 people for a width of 18 inches, located 9 in a row.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Giants aircraft often exchanged blows on technical issues through advertising in trade press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">She recently demonstrated what can be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers slide depicting three people in the restaurant, pressed to each other, called «You would agree to that?»</seg>
		<seg id="11">«Boeing offers long-haul flights on the seats are narrower than that of regional turboprop aircraft», - said the head of the sales Airbus John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">With diet changes people gaining weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed cardinally.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 asked standards of modern long-distance travel, and abroad century weight of the average American men aged 40 to 49 years old increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of health.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Waist circumference of the average American men of the 21st century is 39,7 inches, according to the statistics of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus argues that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats 1950s, when the average waist those who recently called the «jet public», was already.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus says commissioned a study showing that extra inch in width seat improves the quality of sleep is 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputes the figures Airbus size seats and said that producers should not interfere in the decisions about how the airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.</seg>
		<seg id="18">According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.</seg>
		<seg id="19">«All really boils down to providing airlines choice and the opportunity to do what they believe they must do to achieve success,» the expert said Boeing salons Kent Крейвер.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They do not want, that we decide for them that will bring them profits.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For passengers question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers is increasingly becoming a factor that can influence on profit.</seg>
		<seg id="23">For this dispute is worth the race for the orders for aircraft, valued at least $700 billion in catalogue prices in the coming decades is enough to change the balance of American and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As first reported in July, Reuters, the location of the seats - this is exactly what rivalry heats up in the battle between the latest jet planes.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20% increase profitability on the one place in their latest twin-engine long-range models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">These performances Boeing partially based on a comparison of 10 seater series 777X with the original 9-seater layout of the rows of a constructive solution to 777.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Win in the unit cost decreases when compared with the 10-seater layout, currently used.</seg>
		<seg id="28">«The reason why Boeing is doing this, is to squeeze in more places and make your flight more competitive than our developments,» said Kevin Кенистон, head of comfort for passengers, the Airbus in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, analysts say saloons with full 10-local rows to existing 777-x indicate that many passengers prefer dense placing, which go hand in hand with lower rates.</seg>
		<seg id="30">«Seat width eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the sentence Airbus due to the threat from 777-th model,» the expert said on interior Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing do not supply the chair, but the offer supplier directory, from which the airline can choose.</seg>

		<seg id="4">Within two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo is one of the most violent clashes since the conclusion of the truce more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once a popular insurgency, which was supported by the first white authorities Rhodesia, and then the government of South Africa's apartheid-era efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After the armistice of 1992 it became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts believe that the country will hardly again revert to full-scale conflict, but recent events have made nervous foreign investors and the local people.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore reserves of gas and coal deposits in the North-West could raise over $50 billion in investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling party Frelimo, the leading political force since 1975, and the party Renamo accuse each other of the current tensions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Party Renamo claimed that the government was the instigator of the recent clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamo, October 17.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The attack on the former rebels then exacerbated when government troops attacked the base Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Дхлакаму - leader of the group, told the newspaper the Financial Times Fernando Мазанга, the representative of Renamo.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government blames Renamo in triggering clashes, blaming the party in the attack on the soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel the fears of instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Guebuza said AFP, the French news Agency on Wednesday that Mr. Дхлакама felt a «loser», захотевшим use «all that remains of his strength, to try to prove that he is able to impose a government of their own decisions».</seg>
		<seg id="15">As Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid the war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">However concerns have increased after reports that Мазанга said about the refusal of Renamo from the peace agreements of 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the Financial Times that meant the failure of the agreement the party Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">«Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously,» said Мазанга.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The previous negotiations between the parties have made little to ease tensions, which strengthened a series of clashes this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">«It's two influential person (Guebuza and Дхлакама), foreheads touching,» said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and expert in Mozambique.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Party Renamo, trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted this as an attempt to pressure the weakened movement concessions and financial bonuses from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Share of votes for Renamo declining since 1992, while the new party - Democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based former member of the Renamo is expected to improve its performance in these elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr. Мазанга says Mr. Guebuza, who must step down next year, when the end of his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">«He does not want to multiparty democracy, he does not want to transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the post of President,» said Мазанга.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Unclear what capabilities does the Renamo, however, she already had a devastating and violent attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key highway leading from North to South.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers North of Maputo, but includes Бейру port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, the Rio has suspended the use of Railways for about a week after Renamo threatened attack on the railway.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Мазанга was evasive when he asked to repeat whether Renamo this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Party Renamo wanted to «warn the international community that the case in Mozambique are not very good,» said Мазанга.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Instability has strengthened discontent with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and frequent recently kidnapping, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.</seg>
		<seg id="34">«People think that responsibility for the future of the country rests with the government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems,» he says.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail of the dog connected with her mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wag their tails towards the right (from the point of view of a dog), while the other dog помахивают tail mainly in the left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other representatives of canids can detect these subtle differences in the impact of the tail and react to them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Валлортигара, neuroscientist from Trent University, says: «it is Well known that people left and right sides of the brain differently participate in the formation of inducements that evoke positive or negative emotions.»</seg>
		<seg id="4">We attempted to look at this and other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that, as the man with the dogs right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and Vice versa, and two hemispheres have played different roles in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs react to various повиливания tails of other dogs, the researchers observed the animals when they watched films about the other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured heart rate animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Probably, soon we will understand why their tails sometimes sent in one direction and sometimes in another</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Валлортигара said: «We showed dogs videos with dogs of any naturalistic version or of a silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we have been able to manipulate the movement of the tail and direct tail more to the left or right».</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals saw that for the rest, nothing expressing dog moved her tail to the right, from the point of view of the shuffling tail of the dog), they remained perfectly relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they noticed the tail inclined mainly to the left (again in terms of shuffling tail of the dog), their heart rate uchashchalos ' and they looked alarmed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professor Валлортигара said that he did not think that dogs are deliberately communicated with each other by using these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In fact, he believes that the dog learned from your experience, what movements they should worry about, and what - not.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He said: «If this takes place several meetings with other dogs and often swerving their tail in one way connected with the more friendly behaviour, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience».</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and tamer deeper understanding of the emotions of his animal.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Expert in the field of behaviour of dogs John Bradshaw, visiting research fellow at the veterinary school of the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to test whether a value for dogs left and right sides.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found out that the dog turn of the head to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and the right, if you look at rather a dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another research of the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: «the Dog more often came to the dog-robot wobbling her tail was subjected to left instead of right, instead of getting anxious, the opposite behavior in relation to the Italian research.»</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the different studies are not fully perceived animals in the movies or dogs-robots as dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Might be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">«While various mammals there is sufficient evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many of the details still to be clarified, and the dog is not an exception,» he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, given the ease with which may be registered by their behavior, probably, soon we will understand why their tails sometimes sent in one direction and sometimes in another.</seg>

		<seg id="6">They want the government gave priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, and did not spend time on a long and difficult process of reforming the intricate EU institutions.</seg>

		<seg id="9">The last and most demonstrative - our Executive opinion survey revealed that a clear majority wants the United Kingdom conducted a course on modification of the agreement and the relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This result, which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and largest business groups shows that business insists on a «significant change», which will return the powers back to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are high - achieving changes in the contract and are more favorable terms for the UK will provide the 16 percent shift in voting to stay in the EU.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Russia beyond the struggle for urban pollution cars</seg>
		<seg id="1">Attempts to solve the transportation problems of big cities were observed in most cities in the world since the second half of the twentieth century.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As a rule was either their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or attempting to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars and the time of their use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A well-known example of Singapore, where the introduced strict quotas increase the number of private cars, and the right of their acquisition bought at auction.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Its price may be two to three times higher than the price of the car.</seg>
		<seg id="5">European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry to the city center.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing so-called green zone, where entrance is allowed only vehicles with certain экоклассом using fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric vehicles).</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Agency of environment protection Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 &quot;five year plan for clean air&quot;, worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).</seg>
		<seg id="8">As told to &quot;Kommersant&quot; the Director of the division for control transport pollution, the municipal Bureau of environmental protection Beijing Whether Куншенг, the main goal of the five year plan - reduction of the leading air pollutants on 20-35% by 2017, the growth in the number of private cars, to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million)and increase of no more than 5% of fuel use per vehicle.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the Agency, now the vehicles in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Among the main measures of the programme - the restriction of the use of motor transport, as well as the introduction of additional tax for car owners.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Among other things, urban measures &quot;green five-year plan include accelerated compared with the rest of the country transition to European standards of fuel, introduction of local eco-standards and labels for cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of vehicles in the Central part of the city, bans on older vehicles (in addition, creating a financial incentive programmes replacement of old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), development of electric transport (including public and official), development of public transport (including broadband).</seg>
		<seg id="12">Among the automotive innovation Beijing prohibition also applies to all private cars on movement within the fifth ring road (just in the Chinese capital six) one day of the week relevant information is contained in a number plate of the vehicle), and the issuance of registration plates for vehicles based on a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of a lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing amounted to only one-third the amount of 2010).</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to the existing state program &quot;environmental Protection in 2012-2020 years, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 year there were 138).</seg>
		<seg id="14">According to the Ministry, in 2011, the &quot;mobile sources accounted for 41% of all pollutants emissions in the cities.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars in ten times higher than industrial, but in Saint-Petersburg - nine times.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the Russian Federation yet only start to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Director of the Institute of transport Economics and transport policy of the HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for car travel, it is an unpopular, they can be accepted only if they complete versatility.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In the case of Moscow occurs unique problem connected with the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts are service and personal cars as well as cars of the &quot;privileged&quot; users, total number of which is not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total vehicle fleet of Moscow).</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recently urbanists of the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared the study, where the balance of urban areas between residential buildings, the area of road coverage and number of vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The main conclusions of the researchers: the city centre is provided roads in two times less than required, and the majority of car owners living in the centre, not to use their cars every day, leaving them on for a long time in Parking lots or just on the streets.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In result, it is proposed to build no Parking, and storage of cars, not expand, and reduce roadway (so that the streets were more friendly to pedestrians and to limit the use and disposal of personal transport within the boundaries of the buffer zone of the historic centre (total area about 3212 hectares, covering a number of Central areas of the city).</seg>

		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges Бвелле seen his father came back to life and re-lapse into unconsciousness, wandering on the hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Джамеф Бвелле was injured in a car accident in 1981, close to the Yaounde, capital of Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First he only had a broken arm, but the contagion spread to the brain and caused a hematoma, which reminded about itself until the end of life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">«In Cameroon was not neurosurgeons, &quot; said George Бвелле.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If we had money, we would have brought it from Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead Бвелле years was accompanied by his father in crowded clinics and hospitals receiving any medical treatment that they could get.</seg>
		<seg id="14">«It's not easy, &quot; said Бвелле.</seg>
		<seg id="15">- You can leave home at 5 in the morning, run to the hospital to be first, but you are not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Patients very much.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some may die due to the fact that they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation has not changed much since then, as the father Бвелле died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to the world health organization in Cameroon, only one doctor for 5000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">For comparison, the ratio in the United States - one doctor 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if камерунцы could go to a doctor, many of them could not afford.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in this country live in poverty, and nearly three-quarters of health care costs are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">«Their only problem is poverty, &quot; said Бвелле.</seg>
		<seg id="24">- And because of poverty they can't enjoy your life».</seg>
		<seg id="25">Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Бвелле was filled with determination something to do with it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Last year Dr. Georges Бвелле and his team of volunteers spent 700 free transactions.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a physician and works vascular surgeon at the Central hospital of Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He also founded a non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside at weekends for provision of free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers assisted some 32 000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, and a further 30 people stuffed in vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies and travel cross country to visit in need of assistance in the village.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Not always they lucky.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Not once they had to push the car through the river and dirt.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best premises, which can be offered by local residents.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Free medical care in these villages is indeed cause for celebration, and Бвелле with his broad smile and boundless energy of more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning brigade begins to take hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">«We take 500 people in each trip,» said Бвелле.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come from all over the territory in radius of 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others may get crutches, donated points or free of birth certificate - the documents necessary for the school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evenings brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Surgery is usually held in a school building, a municipality, or in the house; after the procedure patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitary processing of the equipment, Бвелле and its volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">This back-breaking pace, but purposefulness brigade usually help to maintain a village musicians.</seg>
		<seg id="45">«They all night beating drums, so we watched and continued to work», - said Бвелле.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday the members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">This group of камерунских doctors and foreign medical students conducted 700 free transactions last year, and they know that their assistance can be of immense value to those they are helping.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One man explained that he had received free surgery for the treatment of hernia will allow it to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">«This will change the future for me and my family,» said the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to these clinical techniques in the weekend and work in the hospital surgeon Бвелле also works nights in private health clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It is this second job, he said, provides 60 % of funding non-profit organization, and the remaining funds are covered by private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">«I don't even know when he's asleep,» said Katie O'malley, a medical student of the second course Дрексельского University in Philadelphia, a volunteer group Бвелле.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He always either in the hospital or tries to earn money for the organization to continue this campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For future doctors and nurses like O'malley, coming from the USA and Europe to join the Бвелле in its tasks, it is possible to practice, which they would never have at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">«We have an opportunity to assist in the operations, where we have helped to remove the stain of blood or keep tools for doctors Бвелле», said O'malley.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Being a sophomore, you would never have in America.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Student volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often coming from the donated drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But on arrival in Yaounde their food, transportation, and tuition is paid by the Бвелле.</seg>
		<seg id="59">«He is a hero, without a doubt,» said O'malley.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He gives his life, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon endlessly.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Бвелле almost constant workloads not is a difficult challenge.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Help live a happy life with others, doing this to his father the promise is what brings him great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">«I'm so happy when I make this work, &quot; said Бвелле.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think about my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I'm doing.</seg>

		<seg id="6">&quot;Statement of 'Brotherly circle' more like trying to unite isolated criminal groupings&quot;, - said an expert on organized crime and Professor at new York University, mark Galeotti.</seg>
		<seg id="7">According to him, &quot;brotherly circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;I haven't met anyone Russian law enforcement bodies, or elsewhere, who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization&quot;, - quotes Mr. Galeotti American Center for the study of organized crime and corruption.</seg>

		<seg id="14">However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personality and have no relation to Usoyan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to him, all combined the rather General financial and criminal interests, such as drug trafficking from Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the scandal around the inclusion of the &quot;brotherly circle&quot; of Grigory Leps - favorite singer of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin - has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Naturally, we expect that we will receive from our American colleagues, partners of more detailed information, in connection with which such decision was made, why he is in such lists are made, - said the press-Secretary of the head of state, Dmitry Peskov.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and large-scale redundancies.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Our main concern now is not the fact that growth has slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Recently he is entirely due to the consumption, which almost does not wind speed&quot;, - said the chief economist at Goldman Sachs Russia Clemens Graph, representing yesterday quarterly report of the Bank's share on the Russian economy.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Now the nominal growth of wages in Russia - about 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="6">When inflation is 6% he can provide for future consumer demand approximately on the current level, expected Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But the profitability of Russian companies falls, therefore, most likely, they will be engaged in optimisation of expenses on personnel.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Today we can see a significant growth of the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, GDP only by 2%, - explained Mr. Graph.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Companies have faced decrease of profitability.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If it grows, it can lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Not to raise the salaries of Russian business can't, says chief economist at Barclays Capital in Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Unemployment near historic lows competition for workers is high.</seg>
		<seg id="13">To lure employees, or to keep current, employers are required to raise the salary.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Consumption in Russia is supported and very fast growth потребкредитования.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to Mr. Column, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country this type of lending has not.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;The benefit to the economy from growth потребкредитования we did not see, money is not diverge in Economics, and returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments&quot;, the economist said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But the problem is - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay for unsecured loans.</seg>
		<seg id="18">They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to give to the collateral.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Interest rates on these loans are high.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, they often do not return&quot;, - said Mr. Graph.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia - possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Director of Bank Institute of the HSE Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of impending banking crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Small credit organizations, not having an access to cheap resources, which have state banks were required to raise the population's funds at high interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In response, the state-owned banks went on the warpath, and lowered loan rates, continues economist.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Small credit organizations cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If state-owned banks refuse dumping, Russia will face a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist believes the harbinger of a mass collapse.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;State-owned banks themselves with such a situation will not cope: the Deposit insurance system was not originally designed for the system crisis&quot;, warns the head of the Institute.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But consumption growth will slow and without payment crisis, analysts at investment Bank, due to the rejection of indexation of salaries of civil servants and military incorporated in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Partially blow consumption will be mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as consequence, reduction of inflation).</seg>
		<seg id="31">But only partially: if the investment is not grow (and prerequisites is that yet - see reference), consumption growth is still slow, sure in Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Vladimir Pantyushin Barclays Capital does not see any prerequisites for the realization of the pessimistic scenarios.</seg>
		<seg id="33">&quot;The main risk is still falling oil prices,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="34">According to him, the Russian economy will start to decline in the oil price below $ 90/Barr.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank can cut interest rates in the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There is a paradoxical picture: inflation declined and banks started to raise interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="37">This may indicate that they did not believe the Central Bank, who put out a transition to inflation targeting,&quot; said Clemens Graph.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The interest rate policy of the Central Bank on market rates does not affect only affects the interbank lending rates.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;For the Central Bank is a crash of all hope&quot;, - said Clemens Graph.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank, banks are used not for lending to the economy, but to manage its liquidity</seg>
		<seg id="41">Once the rate is decreasing, immediately changed the exchange rate, this means that the funds are trying to avoid the speculation against the ruble.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy is not working,&quot; said Mr. Column and reminded that to let the ruble float freely&quot; the state plans by the end of 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But you either have to do it earlier, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5 percent), he said.</seg>
		<seg id="44">According to his estimates, the ruble now artificially inflated by 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Ruble only one road - weary, - concludes the expert.</seg>
		<seg id="46">But if the Central Bank provides the финансистах even a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy by the weakening of the ruble, it can crash the ruble much stronger.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Passengers can use their own electronic devices during the entire flight to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but do not speak on their mobile phones, according to welcome the new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal aviation administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that changes will occur immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Airlines will have to show the FAA, as their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they update their manuals for flight crew and rules laying devices to meet the new guidelines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA has stated that it has already received the plans of some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have submitted plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">«Depending on the state plan, we could approve the extension of the use of electronic devices very soon», - said the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently passengers must disable its smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as soon as the door of the plane closes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They should not restart them until the aircraft has reached an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain did not give «good».</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers must turn off your device again, when the aircraft is reduced for planting, and to exclude them until the aircraft is on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are adequately protected from electronic interference, it may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, said the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most new aircraft and other aircraft, modified so that the passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Глейдинг, President of the Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">«After the new policy will be successfully implemented (and we're going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win situation,» said Глейдинг.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We frankly tired feel «duty to school»when it comes to this subject.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the connection to the Internet for surfing, e-mail, text messaging or data loading will still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the Agency reported.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers will be asked to switch their phones, tablets, and other devices into airplane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thus, still no Words from friends,» intellectual Internet-game, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was a notorious example: actor was removed from the plane of airline American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But heavy equipment such as laptops, would still need to be laid in the Luggage compartment as they can to injury, if you will be flying around the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mobile phone calls in flight also will continue to be prohibited.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Regulatory authority for phone calls belong to the Federal communications Commission, and not the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take off and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month mark Розенкер of the National transport safety Council, the national expert on the safety of transportation, CBS News, said that cell phones is still considered a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">«Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially cause harmful interference to navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they may interfere with cell tower when the plane is in the air,» said Розенкер.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Industry Advisory Committee established by the FAA to study this issue, recommended last month that the government allowed the wider use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years, pressure mounted on the FAA, with the aim of easing restrictions on their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics, such as Senator from Missouri Claire Маккаскил, argued that the prohibitions are no valid reasons related to safety.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Compliance with the restrictions also becoming increasingly difficult to achieve, because the use of the devices became widespread.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore directives turn off your devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA started to restrict the use of passengers electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers started to carry FM radios - high-tech gadgets that time.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of airplanes, but they also developed and approved by the FAA, as resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines offer passengers Wi-Fi at a cruising altitude for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi-systems, which are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of liners adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to new guidelines, said Huerta.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals a much lower power than previous generations of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals scroll through the pages.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the signals become more powerful when the device upload or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among those who sought to ease the restrictions on the use of passengers electronic devices, the company was Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, the company representatives have downloaded a airliner their devices for reading electronic books Kindle and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the Advisory Committee FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices is any risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers, said that he considered interference from devices real, even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other members of the Committee said that there are only individual messages pilots, confirming that the devices can cause interference with aircraft systems, and most of these messages are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that the FAA allowed pilots require passengers off the device while planting the devices in conditions of limited visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group of representatives of tourist industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers, which now use a variety of technological devices.</seg>
		<seg id="45">«We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of the passengers is not incompatible with security and protection,» said Roger Dow, General Director of the Tourist Association of the United States.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed антиникотиновую vaccine, which could deprive the process of Smoking cigarettes pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests before the start of the trials, which will take several years, but the Professor Ronald Crystal of the medical College Уэйлл Cornell in new York said that the first results are encouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="4">«We hope this strategy for the use of the vaccine could finally help the millions of smokers who try to quit, having tried all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern means,» said Professor at Cornell.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was designed to carry genetic information for the production of антиникотиновых antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Antibodies stalk any molecule of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the obtaining of a smoker nicotine kick.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In tests vaccinated mice that later gave nicotine, continued their normal activity.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But mice that were not given the vaccine, «relax», and this is a sign that nicotine reaches their brain, say the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Previous tobacco vaccine failed, because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections should have done so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns the liver cells in the factories of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But it is more likely that it will be used smokers to quit Smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">«They know that if they are to start Smoking again, will not give them this pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit,» he said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers to $100 for what they are carrying hand Luggage on Board their flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep all of the Bank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new fee for hand Luggage cover bags in the upper baggage compartments, so small bags placed under a seat, will remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said it would charge $25, if the fee is payable in advance and $100, if travelers will pay only once at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The representative of the Frontier Kate O'malley said that the fee of $100 must make the passengers to take care about paying in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">«We do not want to charge for it,» she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines have started to charge for the first and second bag, delivered as a baggage in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers trying to avoid these fees, fill as many could, in your hand Luggage placed in overhead storage compartments, which in these compartments often not enough space.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees - one of the ways to make passengers carry less on Board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'malley said that this new collection is not really for the sake of making money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The fact is that most loyal customers Frontier claim that find a place in the top Luggage compartment becomes more and more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website, will not have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that one passenger in the queue at the exit for the flight Frontier may get the opportunity to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'malley said that the change of procedures in the website and check-in counter Frontier is designed to ensure that passengers will know about collecting before they get to the departure gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">New collection Frontier for carry-on baggage will not be charged until the summer, though the date has not been established.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often complain about the fees for checked bags and other charges, but the airline their love.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on wall street consider adding baggage charges sign that the airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However, most of them related to fees for carry-on baggage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for carry-three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the consultant said on airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the incremental fees.</seg>
		<seg id="22">By his assessment the report of December 2011, the fee for hand baggage brings the Spirit $50 million per year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, former top-Manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew the flight of the Spirit, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, when passengers will face an unusual collection of Spirit for carry-on baggage.</seg>
		<seg id="24">«The process of planting was the smooth that I've seen in my career in the airline,» he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth, and the emergence of a fight at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he said, «and landing has passed rapidly.»</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also follows the Spirit to paying $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier said that passengers who get a soda or juice can keep the whole Bank and that topping coffee will be provided free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It will still be free to distribute the water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned it after seven months, after the passengers started to complain and no other largest airline had not followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Initiative Frontier to charge fees for carry-on baggage when passengers buy tickets directly from the airline's latest measure to attract customers to your web site.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">This gave all airlines incentive to encourage passengers can buy tickets directly from them, rather than contact the online travel Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">However Frontier went further in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September, she started giving two times less award miles frequent flyer card customers who have purchased tickets through an online travel Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday she cut the number of premium miles to 25 per cent of miles of travel.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So, the journey of 1000 miles from the Frontier, purchased from online travel Agency, would get 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets on the website of the Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The Frontier have a base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but its business is reduced and becomes unprofitable.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Revenue declined 9 percent, and flight capabilities have been reduced by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday parent company of Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic tries to correct the Finance Frontier in the framework of the sale of the airline.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Germany was the first European country to recognize the third floor in babies born to women with external genital organs of the intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Newborns will not necessarily ascribe male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as «indefinite» or «unspecified» in their birth certificates.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from the parents, who can take a hasty decision about surgery for assigned sex newborn, and counteract discrimination intersex people from happening.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One интерсексуальный people, according to the BBC, said many years later: «I not a man and a woman».</seg>
		<seg id="6">I'll stay doctors created a patchwork product with bruises and scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Approximately one out of two thousand children born each year, is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They интерсексуальность, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of «disturbance of sexual development» - an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes, гонадами (ovaries or testes) or unusual developed outer sexual organs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson may have been интерсексуалом.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Gender identity, has until now not been studied, but most experts in the United States say that if Paul could not be determined, it is better to use all the available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child prior to the operation, if ever, happens.</seg>
		<seg id="11">New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, which specializes in the issues of gender identification, said that the new German law sounds like a good idea».</seg>
		<seg id="12">Интерсексуальные children create ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">«Some people have life-threatening disorders, which require surgical intervention, however, most children do not have them,» he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can assign the floor without surgery and then see how it develops personality.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science of how the child develops any gender identity is not too accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one can answer questions about why this is happening.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is like a mystery about why people are homosexual.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people from happening as different from transsexual or transgender, as their condition is not related to gender, and to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively neither male nor female, and is typical for both at the same time or not characteristic for any one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics can be manifested in secondary sex characteristics, such as muscle mass distribution of hair on the chest and body shape; primary sex characteristics, such as the reproductive organs and the genitals or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also provides an overview about the discrimination faced by интерсексуальные and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of oppression, cruelty and crimes motivated by prejudice.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Boys with gender deviations now there is a special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal have already allow adults to put a male, female or «third sex» in its official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia norri may-Welby became the first man in the world, recognized as «asexual», defended in court the right to the preservation of «undefined» sex status for life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of internal Affairs, the German passports will be used third designation in addition to the M and F - X, that is интерсексуальный.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues are still causing contradictions, according to a news release on channel France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011 dozens of lawmakers from France, this pronounced Catholic country, signed a petition for withdrawal of the «gender theory» from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">American web site Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that «in a situation where the world is drawn into the new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity no, we are turning the two pillars of civilization».</seg>
		<seg id="28">One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also reported the web-site Baby Zone, that she would prefer that children have established a floor at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">«Raising a child is hard enough without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,» she said web site for parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born with male and female sex organs, called гермафродитами - on behalf of the beautiful Greek God, who possessed the characteristics of both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And even just ten years ago, the medical community perceptions of gender as a sheet, which can all be erased, and then draw again.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now many challenge the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and the doctor will sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive assigned floor when he grows up.</seg>
		<seg id="34">«In the middle of the XX century it was called &quot;urgent psychiatric case,» said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When such children were born, you were calling not a psychiatrist - you called a surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The predominant theory about how to treat children with the genitals intermediate type was proposed by Dr. John Mani from the Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easy to change.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He coined the term «gender identity» and argued that environmental signals, including social - how parents raise their child, interact with genes and hormones child, determining whether people consider themselves as male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one case, 1966, known as «John/Joan», his theories were in question.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during negligent circumcision, completely neutered child, removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">«Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not so», - said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15 years old, he was again the boy and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But at the age of 38 he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher said that some doctors still use this model».</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who have experienced these sex change surgery, have declared themselves «unhappy outcome.»</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such was also the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but genitals intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors could not accurately determine whether there was it a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never have a «full life» men.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Therefore, soon after his birth in 1976 external penis and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He began to give a female hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">«I knew that I'm not a girl,» he said ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In the 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But depressed and realizing that something's wrong, he required medical documentation.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he learned was terrible.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilised at birth, and no one ever told me about it.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with the violation of sexual development which did not give his body to produce sufficient testosterone for normal development of the genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Having learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving testosterone injections and removing their chest.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Operation made it unfruitful.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today it advocates in other organization under the name of the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Тэмар-Mattis, Executive Director of the California law Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law encourages earning shortcuts and stigma».</seg>
		<seg id="60">«Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and to give the child &quot;indefinite floor,» she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We fear that he will contribute to the intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We believe that it is better to assign male or female, and then wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we have not seen how to show itself this law, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Тэмар-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law, because «it allows adults to people to make a choice in favor of a third sex.»</seg>
		<seg id="65">«Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,» she says.</seg>
		<seg id="66">German law implies its assignment at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This battle, in which young children should not join at this stage.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, they can then make decisions regarding her own body.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Barats, mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh who had a daughter with violation of sexual development and that helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law will «support» both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Daughter Barats, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but it has a disturbance in sexual development called «syndrome complete insensitivity to actually androgen».</seg>
		<seg id="71">Since its androgen receptors work correctly, Kathy developed women's signs.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now, at the age of 29, Kathy is married and goes residency training in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Despite the fact that she was barren, she hopes to become a parent by adoption or gestational surrogacy.</seg>
		<seg id="75">«The law gives parents time to not to make hasty decisions for themselves,» said Barats.</seg>
		<seg id="76">It gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they write «male» or «female».</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this case, you're right - raise a child, like a child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We don't need haste to do the operation, which is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">«It allows children to participate in the decision and addresses the excitement that motivates parents, because they do not feel they are doing the right thing,» she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Eventually the child will decide what Paul him or her more comfortable, and it is splendid.</seg>
		<seg id="82">It gives children the opportunity to decide for themselves.</seg>

		<seg id="5">On Thursday the court of appeals heard oral arguments on a motion to suspend the case.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The appeals court stated the need for disqualification of a judge due to the fact that it violated the code of conduct for judges of the U.S. and ignored the need to avoid demonstration of bias, partly due to a series of interviews in the media and official statements of public response to criticism of the court.</seg>

		<seg id="2">He stated this in the course of communication with the readers of your page on Facebook.</seg>
		<seg id="3">I can definitely say that prices are determined by many factors, among which are, including customs payments.</seg>

		<seg id="5">And this will mean that prices should be reduced.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Federal government insists that the rescue package in the amount of $325 million to a weakened health system Tasmania will be supplemented with strict conditions that ensure that the state government does not spend their money wasted.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Minister of health Tanya Плиберсек announced that the Commonwealth accepts «urgent measures»to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state, higher levels of chronic disease and the limitations of the system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A decision of financing within a period of four years was made after consultations of the government with independent Deputy Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">«The government has proposed a package of emergency measures, which, we believe, will solve the specific problems facing the state», said Ms. Плиберсек.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Package size $325 million includes $31 million blitz campaign on planned operations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another 2600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract operations, will help close the gap.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There is also money for clinics accepting patients without an appointment, in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after hospital, the training of medical specialists, mental health services and introduction of systems of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals.</seg>

		<seg id="16">But the Federal opposition representative of health Peter Dutton thinks that the present Declaration is a «solution similar to лейкопластырю».</seg>
		<seg id="17">«The reason we are here is that the labour government of the state vomited $430 million from the health care system,» he said on ABC TV.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Obstructionism can't justify the problems with the web site of the reformed Obama's health care system, drones attack</seg>
		<seg id="4">Memoirs about the Obama campaign 2008 are a sad reminder of what could be</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris a second - year student of medical faculty of Harvard University.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I read terribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I thought this book will inspire me in times of discouragement on the second year of the medical faculty and revive in me a sense of hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It's called «the Audacity to win», and it is a memoir about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In the evening when I am writing the reports of my patients and I go to bed, this book takes me back to the time when the policy has inspired millions of people, and the presentations could capture the spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The victory at the elections was impressive, and conducting of the programs pause for reflection of this historic moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates wept for joy, and my parents took care of all the Newspapers, which only they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The White house had to come a young team of strategists, and people were ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At the time of entry Obama in office in 2008, the level of support amounted to 82 %.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Return currently represents a rude awakening as pulling out of the dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is difficult to remember those days of optimism, they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of the missed opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the years since then, as I lowered my first ballot, changes have indeed occurred.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was something that I could not even imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I give Obama credit for its large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on accessible medical aid until the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the abolition of the rule «don't ask, don't tell»killing Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Furthermore, I believe that the party obstructionism blocked too many attempts to move this country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health care and to close the base in Guantanamo, among others.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after countless times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I ran explanation that I can provide.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I had reached the point of political desperation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Obstructionism Republicans can't explain authorization to wiretap foreign leaders or unmanned aircraft strikes on innocent children in other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It can't explain the collection of information about the private lives of Americans by the national security Agency or prosecution whistleblowers that reveal the unlawful actions of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It can't explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or failure to comply with the limits of public funding and expenses during the presidential campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He can't justify the findings of the report, which States that applied the White house effort to silence the media, are «the most aggressive, since the days of the Nixon administration».</seg>
		<seg id="27">And lately he can't justify what you cannot develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable healthcare.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Don't know that I would expect.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Whether I was at the age of 18 years to understand that leadership may be contrary to political campaigns, which precede him?</seg>
		<seg id="30">Clearly, the work of the elected office is not predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and such random events like the massacre in Newtown.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However, in all the above-mentioned examples can be seen that they were greatly own choices administration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And that is what bothers me the most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Again I voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">MITT Romney was a strange and rough alternative, he seemed unable to take a decision on its own policy or views.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I thought that in his second term Obama, freed from the pressure of the upcoming elections, will justify the hopes that we have heard for such a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, when this week Obama's rating fell below 45 %, return in 2008 this book will become much more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me yearn for many promises, which vanished.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton struck Obama deafening defeat in the primary election in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At the meeting on the analysis of the reasons of failure he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain true to their goal.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police, when Mursi arrived with a small tuple shortly after 11 a.m. local time.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court, to welcome the new President, and, unlike the presidential pump times Mubarak, traffic was stopped only briefly to skip his motorcade on the normally busy road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Although Mursi derided as нехаризматичное «spare tire «Brothers», his personal prestige has grown dramatically since its victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who want to bring to the end the uprising 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">«Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern country», - said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges, wood-panelled hall, where he took the oath.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Later Mursi went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He was received with an official reception with the army orchestra performed the national anthem, during which he was standing at attention.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Attended military leader, Marshal Hussein Tantawi.</seg>
		<seg id="14">His arrival was greeted with the slogan «the Army and the people, one hand», which chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the University.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Founded in 1908 as a Bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s, became a stronghold of Islamist student groups .</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi took a symbolic oath of office on Friday in Tahrir square, where was born the uprising, which completed the authoritarian rule Mubarak last year, and promised to return the powers of the President, where his position was deprived of the military Council, took the case from the deposed leader.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But after agreeing to the official oath before the court, and not in front of the Parliament, as is customary, it executes the will of the military, and this is a sign that a power struggle will continue.</seg>

		<seg id="3">German media say BfV hoped to discover antenna listening devices, and these actions led to the negotiations between the USA and the Ministry of foreign Affairs in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Clapper, Director of National intelligence of the USA, in September again assured, that the USA do not use the possibility of foreign intelligence for the theft of commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their profit».</seg>
		<seg id="5">But since Edward Snowden - contract employee, who became the unmasker - began to publish his treasure secrets intelligence of the USA, European governments and CEOs are no longer sure whether to trust the Director General of the word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports that the National security Agency USA followed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, and has access to the data stored in the cloud provider in the USA, including Google and Yahoo, raised paranoia corporations, caused by the surveillance state, to new heights.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The last straw was the news that the telephone Chancellor Angela Merkel was listened to, maybe about ten years.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the most influential person in Europe may become a target, then, of course, potential targets are and business leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden has made evident the intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the USA and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I think it quite likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.</seg>
		<seg id="11">«Germany must Wake up,» said Oliver Грюн, President of the Association BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="12">German companies are convinced that the U.S. now represent almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and theft of data, according to a study published in July consulting Agency EY.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Сноуденом, however, there was still no evidence that the United States passed the commercial secrets of the foreign companies in their own companies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Politicians expressed their concern that the EU lacks the specific capabilities in the field of information technologies and the Internet, and suggested that he should try to reduce their dependence on the US.</seg>

		<seg id="20">All subsidized in Germany: from coal to hire and farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">All, apart from the IT-industry.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nevertheless, coverage and technical development agencies espionage USA, which became known through revelation Сноудена were a shock for some companies that used to be thought that the biggest risk to the surveillance of China.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Big shift happens in the cloud technologies, where the leaders of European companies to better realize that the data stored in the United States, are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to research from the trade Association of the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants have abandoned plans to use the services headquartered in the USA cloud provider after the exposure of the American program for the mining Prism.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Jim Снейб, one of the Executive Directors of the SAP, said: «We see that consumers ask a new question that arose a year ago, namely: where is my data and can you guarantee that they are physically remain in this jurisdiction».</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many German authorities say that the last message is just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets and, therefore, these data must be protected at any cost.</seg>
		<seg id="27">What happens economic espionage, is not surprising.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He always had a place.</seg>
		<seg id="29">«It was a subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,» said Kurt Bock, chief Executive officer of the chemical company BASF.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Americans spying on us the commercial and industrial level, and we are also for them spy, because it is in our national interests to defend our businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Leaders of corporations usually do not like to brag about the response that they have taken, as this may provide an advantage to the enemy.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In large companies has long been internalized the idea that free flash exhibition or keep the laptop unattended in the room of the hotel is, at least, imprudent.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Ulrich Хакенберг, member of the Board of Directors automaker Audi, said that for many years it is standard practice is to collect mobile phones before the Board meetings so that they could not be used as listening devices.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The Federal service for the protection of the German Constitution recommends heads of companies consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips vulnerability in smartphones.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Prepaid mobile phones subsequently released.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to break-ins and surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Germany, many of these companies are leaders of the world market in their particular niche.</seg>
		<seg id="38">«Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience of staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access», warns the report BfV.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The United States warned its own companies on economic espionage from other countries.</seg>

		<seg id="1">October 31, the Moscow city court ruled to invalidate the license of the registration Agency &quot;Rosbalt&quot;, - writes the &quot;Ribbon&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The deprivation of the Agency the status of the media insisted Roskomnadzor for systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In the course of the process was a very unfortunate precedent: the court considered it possible to close down the media, actually denying the publication of the right to put forward counter-arguments.</seg>
		<seg id="4">What is the &quot;Rosbalt&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">CJSC &quot;Information Agency Rosbalt&quot; was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In subsequent years, the Agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional offices.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Also the Agency has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since 2001, the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; was developed and functioned as a Federal information-analytical Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="9">By mid-2000s, the Agency included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The &quot;Rosbalt&quot; has always held a very specific niche: the core of the exclusive Agency publications were (and are still) notes referring to sources in law enforcement bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Talk about the proximity of the edition to the security forces continued throughout the existence of the Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Along with the fact that &quot;Rosbalt&quot; had an extensive base of sources in different departments, in favour of such assumptions spoke and that the head of the project there was Natalia Chaplin - wife of Victor Cherkesov.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The role of Чаплиной guide Росбалтом&quot; unclear: most often it is called the &quot;project Manager&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">General Director of the Agency is Larisa Afonina, chief editor, Nikolai Ulyanov.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In the last time &quot;Rosbalt&quot; did not appear in the rankings of the Federal mass media - not for citation, nor on the audience.</seg>

		<seg id="20">The office found a prohibited vocabulary two published on the Agency website videos (&quot;Dzhigit from Krasnodar&quot; and &quot;Pussy Riot defiled oil derricks&quot;).</seg>
		<seg id="21">Further, the parties describe different.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Roskomnadzor on the basis of identified videos accused the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; in the gross and systematic violation of the law on mass media and addressed the court demanding to deprive the Agency of the license.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In &quot;Росбалте argued that the claims office is unwarranted: first, rollers were not editorial materials, secondly, abusive words in them were masked, and, thirdly, right, after warning the videos were removed from the site.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Representatives of the Agency challenged the claims of Roscomnadzor arbitration court and when 22 October 2013 Moscow city court accepted a claim of Roscomnadzor, consideration of these complaints still continued.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, already the 25th day of the magistrate judge issued a decision not in favor of &quot;Rosbalt&quot;: chief editor Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the administrative code and fined on 20 thousand roubles - on 10 thousand for each movie.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Obviously, it has predetermined the outcome of the hearing at the Moscow city court - if abandon the idea that the outcome could be a foregone conclusion even before.</seg>
		<seg id="27">on October 31 the court decided to annul the certificate of registration of &quot;Rosbalt&quot;, effectively eliminating the Agency the status of the media.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Not to say that the &quot;Rosbalt&quot; in the course of this conflict remained alone.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The Agency was supported by the deputies of the state Duma (an application addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov 10 October signed by 26 deputies; the document was submitted on the initiative of the Communist party).</seg>
		<seg id="30">On the illegality of the closure of the periodical stated the head of the Union of journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, Chairman of the Moscow Union of journalists Pavel Gusev, the head of the presidential human rights Council Mikhail Fedotov.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Кереван: the gap with Europe gives the Scots choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another horror story about independence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Comes stories about the passport control at Berwick and the border with barbed wire along the Адрианова shaft.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of a free movement in the rest of Europe, though - which, predictably, it does not appear in the headers.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nor do they pointed out that the EU member States spend a lot of time to turn our formal rules as it suits them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Because Scotland is now not part of the Schengen zone, continued non-compliance is becoming cheap concession to Brussels instead of what he really wanted from the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So this is not a worthwhile story.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And so old that it has turned into a fossil: the first time I heard the «hoax» that «independence means passport control»at least 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the process of paraphrasing the old tales.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why do independent Scotland must obeyed orders of Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">This is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally has stalled.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With еврокризисом project «Europe» is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Throughout the European Union of parties opposed to the EU or for the cancellation of the Euro as a common currency, trying to force.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany the party sceptics «Alternative for Germany - based only this year - it came out of nowhere and got almost five million votes in the September Federal elections, thus essentially pushing the «Free Democrats» (similar to our «Liberal Democrats») of the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Always there was the internal opposition to the plan to establish a Federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, the current economic crisis was a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Austerity measures introduced Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the fetters imposed on the national economy through the conservation of the single currency, have led many people to think that the project «Europe» gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Euro crisis is not connected with the fact that national governments are at excessive budget deficits, - this was true only for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members on exchange rates, favorable for German exporters, - that German politicians and want to save.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency southern Europe is in a pre disadvantage production capabilities in comparison with Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only cure is to cut salaries and government spending that is actively supported by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Because of the current problems of the budget and currency worth a deeper problem productive capacities of Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of complex measures for «green» energy, embedded Brussels - cipher, meaning the subsidizing of the French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more for gas than in the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This парализующе adverse price conditions, as we have seen in Грейнджмуте.</seg>
		<seg id="26">No freezing of salaries in the world will not stop crushing victory cheap shale gas USA over the European petrochemical industry.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result of brewing revolt, especially in France, once the most ardent стороннице EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin is no longer needed in Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and already imposed their own economic policies of Europe, leaving a devastated economy of France in distress.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result - right, anti-EU party marine Le Pen's national front, has just won a decisive election, throwing the ruling party of the socialists in the third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">«Front» is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to the British incoming on that one cannot assume that the split among the right automatically affect in favor of the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among French white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the elections to the EU next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and the single currency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If - and it is very probably anti-EU party will receive support in these elections, the unit will first take a dominant position in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here is my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and the single currency in Europe will unite together to destroy the Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not disappear, but it would again become something of a vague «Europe (sovereign) Nations»that appealed to General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and a number of dependent economies can keep the Euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping closer ties with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific ocean indicates the probability that the UK will remain without attention in the cold Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In what position this leaves Scotland?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to become a region (essentially) Low England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can to protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to hell.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland can succeed within a free European agreement provided that we will keep its currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier to нефедеральной Europe Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise we should consider the possibility of repetition of the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The government of the Scottish national party of Scotland is - strangely enough - the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against the austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 due to objections against cuts in expenditure proposed (and implemented) labour Chancellor of the exchequer Alastair Дарлингом and arisen subsequently coalition tories and liberal Democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Scotland would be ridiculous to vote for independence only to take austerity measures imposed by the Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: the ageing of the earlier</seg>
		<seg id="1">African-American and Latino girls tend to enter puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes do not mean that puberty close</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that the blame hormones or other chemicals</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that obesity can be one of the triggers early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend to early sexual maturity is not so pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">Former CNN correspondent Pet Etheridge - journalist specializing on children's health and family matters.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Whether the mother scared if her daughter begin to form the beginnings of a breast and to grow pubic hair when I was 7 or 8 years?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, a pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Капловитц explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among American girls, and they represent a new standard.</seg>
		<seg id="9">«I spend a lot of time, reassuring parents - usually this does not mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,» said Капловитц.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious signs of development, such as the growing Breasts, pubic and axillary hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) during the last four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States the average age of 12.5 years and decreased in comparison with 12,75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">«After the Breasts start to develop, runs at least two to three years before menarche,» said Капловитц, which is also an author of the book «Early puberty in girls: how to deal with this common problem».</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time - the most accurate test, as puberty progresses.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is a discussion about what is the actual puberty, but deemed «premature», when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth of up to 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process will slow down or suspended - is that a pediatrician can monitor carefully.</seg>
		<seg id="17">More rapid progression can serve as the basis for analyses by an endocrinologist, to eliminate the serious problems such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging bones, which may ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations on drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, growth and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Капловитц careful with drugs, but acknowledges that «suppression of puberty may soften behavioral problems and sensation of girls that they are different from the other girls».</seg>
		<seg id="22">Another big problem is clear: parents just don't want to have them very young daughters were menstruation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">«They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they cope with the issues of hygiene,» said Капловитц.</seg>
		<seg id="24">«It was a shock», - says one woman, the daughter that menstruation began in 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She came home from school a little scared and upset that she was the first among her friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are many advertised theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">However, there is no consistent evidence that blame the hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Boys like girls - puberty occurs earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Капловитц argues that premise, which has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls from 6 to 9 years, which links the amount of body fat with the timing of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country of African-American and Latino girls tend to enter puberty earlier than their white peers.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are different explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Worldwide, early puberty, apparently affects everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another mystery: although boys facial hair and pubic appear at a younger age, the trend toward complete early sexual maturation not so pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other physicians participating in the conference of the AAP, confirmed the complexity of this topic.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair found even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">«We must be careful about how we define true puberty,» said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the children's hospital Гориеб in Morristown, new Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to take instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">«This may mean earlier than expected, the conversation», - explained Капловитц.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you keep quiet, your child usually react well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls who blossom early, need confirmation that even when this happens early, this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In a pawn shop in the Mall Бендемир in Singapore Джанани Амиртхалинга lays the Golden bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for the schooling of his daughter.</seg>
		<seg id="2">«My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is there,» said Ms. Амиртхалинга.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) per month as administrator and her husband still works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, the demand in various parts of Southeast Asia, where the amount of debt of households is growing is that ValueMax, where she spends their deal, this week became the third pawnshop, registered at stock exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Secured loan jewelry is not just a fast way to get your money S$1300 in the case of Ms. Амиртхалинга), but almost as cheap as unsecured Bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Usually pawnshops in Singapore calculate effective annual interest rate of 17%, slightly above - 15,4 %, offered in the Department of United Overseas Bank, a local lender with branch in the same shopping center.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can make loans faster than banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So millions of people throughout the region are treated in pawnshops, as families feel pressure due to rising cost of living and rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of steady growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap credits, подпитывавшихся loose monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and middle income turn in pawnshops, to compensate for the decrease in revenues as slowing in their economies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week, Standard &amp; Poor's, a rating Agency, has indicated the increase of the family leverage, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia led the list with 80 % of GDP compared with 60 % in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, for this week's barely emerged from technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, data showed continued declines in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.</seg>
		<seg id="15">«The point is that with the price increase people in middle and lower parts [of the income scale] will be looking for ways to Supplement their incomes where only be able to», - said song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, the Malaysian Bank.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Record-high gold prices in the last two years have increased the haste with which people put their personal belongings, as they use the possibility to get money for their family jewelry.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore, about 70 % of the things pledged 200 of pawn offices of the city-state, are the gold.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People say: «the Price of gold looks good, let us put a gold chain grandmother and get it back next month».</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnshops EasyMoney observed increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20 %.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Growth in a Lombard business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Department in Бендемире and 15 other in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also outside of Asia, too, says Йеах Lee Ching, Executive Director ValueMax.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will Fund the expansion, using 60 percent of S$66 million raised this week in the result of placement of shares on the stock exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some lenders have caused the fire of criticism due to high interest rates, Ms. Йеах says that Lombard not only offers cheaper rates than other creditors, he also does not increase the debt directly.</seg>
		<seg id="23">«Clients lay the items that they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt,» she says.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Bet wins more and more wide public recognition as a means to obtain a short-term secured funding.</seg>
		<seg id="25">And pawnshops are not only those categories of people who are in dire financial Straits.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Rich people in Singapore also use Department ValueMax, laying gold bars or watch Rolex who can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see clients from all walks of life.</seg>
		<seg id="28">«They include high net worth individuals who need to borrow money for short term commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome the temporary cash problems,» says Ms. Йеах.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Sometimes they just need money very quickly.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Black box you have a car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Until American designers roads trying to find money to repair scattered system of roads, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box, neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">These devices, tracking every проезжаемую motorist mile and transmitting the information to the officials are at the centre of a controversial attempts to modernize the outdated system of financing of highways of America, undertaken by the planners in Washington and the state.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Usually boring arena planning highways unexpectedly gave rise to intense debate and colorful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarians joined ecological groups in lobbying for the provision to the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of проезжаемых your miles and even, perhaps, how they pass, and then use this information for the preparation of tax accounts.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Tea party movement in shock.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American civil liberties Union is also deeply concerned about and raises a number of concerns about privacy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And although Congress could not yet agree or not to continue, several States not going to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They wonder how over the next decade, you can go to a system where drivers pay for each mile of the road, which they are passing.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists have already assumed testing these black boxes, some of which have the function of satellite tracking.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is really necessary for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">«This is not an issue on which we may be the right choice,» said Hasan Ихрата, Executive Director of the Association of governments of southern California, which trains plans to start tracking the state authorities miles, проезжаемых every California motorist, by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Technology for that.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds of the Government Fund the construction of roads, financed by taxes that Americans are paying at the gas stations.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Americans don't buy so much gasoline as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Vehicles passing more miles on one gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The Federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, not increased for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians do not want to raise the tax even a penny with the high prices for gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="19">«Tax on gasoline is simply impossible to save,» said Lee Маннич, expert of transport policy at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In his state was recently installed on 500 cars tracking devices for system testing помильной payment.</seg>
		<seg id="21">«This will be the best alternative in the long term,» he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nerds call it помильной user fees.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Not surprisingly, this idea attracts city liberals, because through taxes will change the nature of trips to alleviate congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Planners in California are looking at this system in development strategies to achieve the targets set ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But a member of the house of representatives bill Shuster (R-PA), Chairman of the transport Committee of the chamber, said that he also sees this system as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Free market advocates in the Fund «Reason» also delighted that force drivers to pay for each mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">«This is not just a tax that will go into a black hole,» said Adrian Moore, Vice President for political Affairs Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People pay for what they receive.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This movement is also supported by two former Ministers of transport of the USA in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction помильной payment.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The US Senate approved last year a pilot project worth $ 90 million, which was attended by about 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However, the leaders of the house of representatives rejected this proposal because of concerns rural legislators representing the voters who in everyday life often have to drive many miles to get to work or city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several States and cities, however, moving this way yourself.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The enthusiasm is manifested in the state of Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country involved 5000 drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon pay staff for miles mileage instead of the gasoline tax.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Nevada pilot project has already been completed.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In new York, he is considered.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">A coalition of I-95, which includes the transport departments of 17 States of the East coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), explores how they can carry out these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This concept has gained General acceptance.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the government can track their every move.</seg>
		<seg id="41">«Concerns about &quot;big brother&quot; and similar things is a big problem,» said Aladdin Khan, head of the questions of strategy and performance management of the transport Department of the state of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It was not what people wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When trials were in full swing, the American civil liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: «It is easy to turn these devices in devices of the full-scale monitoring».</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to create a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which will expand to store records about the routine movements of individual citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of several States where there are difficult search for a cheap technology, which would allow the state authorities to keep records of проезжаемых vehicle miles, but no information about the place and time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you can do it, said Khan, the society will feel more relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Search of this technology have led some state agencies to small, young company in California called the True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Initially, this company is not concerned with assisting in the collection of taxes in the state.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She tried to leave on the emerging market of the types of auto insurance, where drivers pay based on mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices that it tests attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically loaded using a modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">«People will be more inclined to do this if you are not tracking and speed not tracking their location,» said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of the True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Had a couple of big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There is much less expensive and less Intrusive ways to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, the designers are experimenting with the provision of drivers of various options.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose the device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they may give up the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that passing all state residents.</seg>
		<seg id="57">In other places they hope to sell the idea cautious public, forcing the device to do more, not less.</seg>
		<seg id="58">New York city transportation officials seek to develop налогооблагающее device that will also accept payment by Parking meters, provide a «pay as you go» insurance and collect data pool of speed in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.</seg>
		<seg id="59">«Motorists will attract the benefits that would be offered»the document says urban design.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some designers of transport systems, however, think about whether all the talk about помильной payment huge distraction factor.</seg>

		<seg id="2">According to their estimates, consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is the best.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Although businessmen was initially expected to increase.</seg>
		<seg id="4">After all, this year is for them fail: sales fell 7 percent.</seg>

		<seg id="7">From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already dropped by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant strengthening of the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - the drink with a small percentage of alcohol, - informed the listeners Schoeps.</seg>
		<seg id="8">No country in the world has such a hard limit of the beer market, unpredictable introduction of new illogical ban, which is allegedly justified by the struggle with alcohol abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Brewer complained that many of the legal prohibitions designed to reduce the abuse of alcohol, do not have any particular effect, however, there is increasing constantly initiatives.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Every year the city authorities promise to arrange all the more transport hubs).</seg>
		<seg id="2">By 2020 it is planned to put into operation 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What really turns the project, understood our correspondent.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A couple of months ago at the metro station &quot;Smolenskaya&quot; of Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line appeared construction fence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The inscription reads that goes developing transport interchange hub.</seg>
		<seg id="6">All this was very strange, because next to the &quot;Smolenskaya&quot; no land transport stops and therefore take on it.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To get to the nearest bus stop on the Garden ring, it is necessary to overcome some 130 metres, including land crossing Карманицкий lane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now the &quot;Smolensk&quot; almost all finished.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Disappeared flower stall, dismantled stand for Newspapers, and asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced by the building.</seg>
		<seg id="10">That's the whole transport hub.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Transport hubs are flat and capital, - explained in the press-service of the Moscow Department of transport.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Capital TPU yet.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And planar involve the construction of Parking lots, conclusion of commercial objects, hinder passengers, creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Actually, the plane TPU even engaged in the transport workers and professional благоустроители of the Department for capital repair of the city of Moscow.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hub is not necessarily a complex structure, - explains the Director of the Institute of transport Economics and transport policy of the Higher school of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Sometimes quite a roof over their heads and scoreboard, which inform about the time of arrival of transport.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For example, at the metro station &quot;Yasenevo&quot; recently opened quite full-featured plane hub.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Let without awnings, but with перехватывающими Parking and placards indicating when the bus.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But in the pursuit of a number of officials are written in the TPU all that is handy.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In 2011 the municipality planned to build at all about all 151 node, 59 of the capital construction.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Now the plans up to 2020 there are even 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Of them a hundred and fifty promise to pass this year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Although the city has a program of development of TPU has no qualitative criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization &quot;City and transport.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Report on a number of objects, but the quality of transplantation on each of them often worsens.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Criteria, according to the expert, shall be two: first - time decrease of transplantation, secondly convenience.</seg>
		<seg id="26">First of all, the opportunity to change the type of transport, comfort in the rain.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Moscow in the regeneration of TPU sometimes comes out exactly the opposite.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A vivid example of the metro station &quot;VDNKH&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Earlier commuter buses from the Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Now they stop was moved to the opposite side of Ярославки the street of Cosmonauts.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Further from the metro, much further from the monorail, but closer to the residential houses.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The gift that the residents did not want to under the Windows of the bus station and complained in all instances.</seg>
		<seg id="33">With capital TPU in Moscow didn't happen.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The first of them started building five years ago at the metro station &quot;Planernaya&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The project was intended to be a model.</seg>
		<seg id="36">And really turned out to be the model for how hub and left at the mercy of the investors becomes banal shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="37">No, there are platforms for buses, shed, not to go from the underground in the rain, and three floors of Parking lots.</seg>
		<seg id="38">However, the Khimki trolley buses produced in Belarus №202 and №203 in Moscow TPU designated gave fundamentally.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Them as strangers pushed away from the metro.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But the place is under trade more left.</seg>
		<seg id="41">One only service 32 store, but there almost everything from pet supplies to the showroom.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Well, actually, if someone of bus passengers need to buy a new car on the road?</seg>
		<seg id="43">We, when building the capital TPU, somehow always manage to shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Recently the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the Parking decided to give to the market.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Now on the third floor of TPU &quot;Planernaya&quot; among marked on the floor of Parking spaces is a brisk trade.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, нерусская speech and guards viciously поглядывающие on our photographer.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Hub morphed into a Bazaar.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The matter is that earlier at the metro station &quot;Planernaya&quot; the market was, but it was torn down.</seg>
		<seg id="49">And in the Prefecture of traders regret allowed to intercepting Parking hub.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Still due to high prices there is always empty.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The most funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build on its place... a new plane TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Such is the reshuffle.</seg>
		<seg id="53">At the metro station &quot;Kaluzhskaya&quot; distance approach from the vestibule of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="54">After the construction of the shopping centre, allegedly TPU, distance increased to 170 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="55">To take the bus, you must go through the Mall.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After 22 hours when it is closed, it is necessary to bypass it under the open sky.</seg>
		<seg id="57">However, construction on &quot;Planernaya&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot; soon would seem mild by comparison.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In mid-September, the urban land Commission of the city hall approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Four of them will be 25-storey, except for two-three underground levels.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The main monster will grow at the metro station &quot;Tushino&quot;418,7 thousand square meters of area.</seg>
		<seg id="61">Representatives of Directorate for railway stations, Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of TPU near a metro station, told reporters: in future high-rise buildings will accommodate shops, hotels and apartments.</seg>
		<seg id="62">The officials claim that multilevel Parking will occupy from one third to a half of the area.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Take for example the &quot;people's garages.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Say, garage 258 Parking places, recently built on the International street, has an area of 8015 square meters.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Means for Parking by 2.6 thousand auto &quot;Petrovsko-Razumovskaya&quot; will be about 80 thousand &quot;of squares&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="66">This is less than a third of the colossus that there are going to build.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Let one or two floors will go on all sorts of platforms for buses.</seg>
		<seg id="68">Remains of at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="69">And this, for a moment, almost two Gum.</seg>
		<seg id="70">If the capital of TPU stations build the railroad, the other sites will learn метрополитеновцы.</seg>
		<seg id="71">They also promised that there will be many &quot;object functional purpose, including hotels, offices and gyms.</seg>
		<seg id="72">By the way, in the Moscow city property Department recently told journalists that the draft decision by which investors will be able to apply for a land plot for the TPU to officials directly.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Without competition.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Therefore, they say that transport issues for the city - priority.</seg>
		<seg id="75">Perfect TPU is, for example, station &quot;Harvard in Boston or &quot;Спадайна&quot; in Toronto, said Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="76">There trolleybuses and trams go down under the ground level of the underground and distance approach from the train station to the tram is just 50 meters without going outside.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Round no unnecessary trade.</seg>
		<seg id="78">But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.</seg>
		<seg id="79">Either nothing will build any kind of отгрохаем 25 floors with offices and apartments.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Corporation Bombardier, the canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains, announced on Thursday on reduction of net profit by 15 percent under the influence of the decreased number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway division.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Located in Montreal, Bombardier also did not publish any data on flight testing of its latest CSeries aircraft and provided no new information about whether made ambitious plans for the introduction of aircraft in commercial operation by next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the first flight of the prototype aircraft held about one and a half months ago, he had still only three times, raising questions about whether testing phase on track.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results fell short of forecasts and led to the fall of shares of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Доерксен, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced on Thursday its assessment of «above average» to «industry average» from a conviction that the growth of the shares is limited in the next quarter or two.</seg>
		<seg id="6">«Although the reduction in the number of aircraft delivery was generally predictable, we, of course, disappointed with the performance gain of transport Department», - said Доерксен in the review of the stock market.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier receives new orders for the CSeries as the continuation of the flight-test program.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, if in the coming months will not be announced on new orders, we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier is hoped that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to gain a place in the lower price segment of the market where now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first prototype of the aircraft was submitted in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However, the firm orders for the CSeries yet not too much - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to verify the statements of company on fuel efficiency and the potential profitability of the airliner.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Just now there are 403 order and agreement with 15 clients and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Chief Executive officer Pierre Beaudoin was sure that Bombardier achieve its target of 300 firm orders to the moment when the first plane will be put into commercial service.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward according to plan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">«Test model of the aircraft remained on earth longer than expected,» - said he during a conference call, adding that at times when the aircraft were planned ground tests and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">All manufacturers plan to test different.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We decided to hold the first flight and make a break for updates, so we did.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It will be the same throughout the flight-test program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of the five test samples must take a flight in the coming weeks and all the others soon followed, as the company informs.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Yet analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first client will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft is 12 months after the first flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said that it assesses the commissioning and provide new information in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">«The slow pace of flight tests - even though, apparently, and corresponds to an internal graphics Bombardier - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be moved to the first quarter of 2015», - said Доерксен.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter, terminated September 30, net income Bombardier decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Gross profit decreased slightly, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4,56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth in the world largest aircraft manufacturer said that he put 45 aircraft for the quarter, less than the figure for the previous year - 57.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The total number of orders has fallen from 83 to 26 aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The portfolio of orders for the aerospace division was $32,9 billion on September 30, unchanged since 31 December.</seg>
		<seg id="30">«In aerospace results correspond to our goals, however, a small number of incoming orders and General market conditions became an unpleasant factor», - said he.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Gross income for aerospace direction fell 13 percent to $2 billion</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest manufacturer of trains, said that gross income in this sector grew by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion</seg>
		<seg id="33">The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly higher than the 31 of December.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The income of the transport division had a negative impact problems with the execution of several large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Management has declared, that in the fourth quarter will be presented to the new development plan.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that chief financial officer of the Corporation Google Patrick Пичетт will be on the Board, fell by 8.5 percent, up From$4,83 at auction in the middle of Thursday.</seg>
