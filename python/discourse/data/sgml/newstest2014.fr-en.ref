		<seg id="0">NSA Affair Emphasizes Complete Lack of Debate on Intelligence</seg>
		<seg id="1">Why the contradictory attitude of the French government? On the one hand, it publicly takes offence and summons the Ambassador of the United States on October 21 and, on the other, it forbids the Bolivian president's plane to enter its air space on the basis of a rumor that Edward Snowden was on board?</seg>
		<seg id="2">In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.</seg>
		<seg id="3">When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama, or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the Ambassador of the United States, they are responding to a real discovery, that of the scale of America's surveillance of communications within France generally.</seg>
		<seg id="4">And is it not surprising to read in the pages of Le Monde, on the one hand, a reproduction of diplomatic correspondence with the US and, on the other, condemnation of the NSA's spying on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quai d'Orsay, within a matter of weeks?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Is there not an element of hypocrisy on your part?</seg>
		<seg id="6">The journalistic method is not to adopt a moral position, but to investigate the significance and relevance of information and enable every citizen to form an opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When WikiLeaks reveals the American administration's monitoring of political and other matters somewhere in the world, we consider this to be significant enlightenment with regard to the American government.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In describing the American methods of data interception in relation to the French diplomatic representation in the United States, we do not aim at expressing indignation about this practice, but rather at describing the world as it is.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Has France benefited from the intelligence supplied by the NSA concerning terrorist operations against our interests?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Can we do without collaboration with the Americans?</seg>
		<seg id="11">The setting up of high-performance interception technology over practically the past ten years by the United States - and by France - has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Furthermore, in this regard, France and the United States in particular have implemented procedures, sometimes described as essential, for cooperating and exchanging information on an almost daily basis.</seg>
		<seg id="13">For example, France was informed of the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah through the NSA's resources.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Also France may, for example, have to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the Americans and, in return - as already briefly mentioned - the Americans may provide information to the French about other parts of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hence the question at the heart of the NSA affair is not so much the capacity or the right of a country to use interception tools, as the issue of the complete lack of prior debate - especially within parliaments - on the justification of such systems, the extent to which they should be used and, ultimately, the issue of the infringement of freedoms.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What risk does the United States actually run? Ruining its image?</seg>
		<seg id="17">However much we denounce the US, I see no way in which it can be punished.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The risk run by the Americans could be twofold.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The first is when their allies - as has been the case recently - learn that their governments have been spied on, sometimes at the highest level.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States are strained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Another effect could be more commercial: in the light of the revelations, more and more European and South American countries are balking at the idea of entrusting their confidential data to American providers that are subject to American law and hence to the grips of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Finally, the widespread exercise in revelations conducted by the media across the world, which is contributing to the establishment of a debate on surveillance practices by intelligence services that have been almost invisible until now, could force legislators - including those of America - to reconsider the powers they have granted their intelligence agencies.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Barack Obama to Meet Iraqi Prime Minister as Violence Rages</seg>
		<seg id="1">The American President will receive the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri Al Maliki, who is seeking the United States' help in the struggle against the strongest wave of violence in five years, on 1 November 2013, .</seg>
		<seg id="2">October was the bloodiest month in Iraq in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 01 November.</seg>
		<seg id="3">964 people (of which 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers) were killed in acts of violence during October and 1,600 people were injured.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The UN has reported even higher numbers with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The violence is becoming more and more deadly in spite of reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations undertaken in recent months by Nouri Al Maliki's government, which is dominated by Shiites.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.</seg>
		<seg id="7">About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence brings renewed fears of unrest while the country's neighbor, Syria, is in the grip of civil war.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Bombs strike markets, mosques, weddings and funeral ceremonies.</seg>
		<seg id="9">People are attacked in the street and even at home, and the security forces are also frequent targets of the attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The growing discontent among the Sunni minority, which held power under Saddam Hussein and is now complaining of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has favored this outburst of violence.</seg>
		<seg id="11">On Friday, the latest acts of violence left four people dead in the north of Iraq, a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, which included five booby-trapped cars being blown up in the north of Baghdad.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The majority of the violence is attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), which is also involved in the civil war in Syria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nouri Al Maliki wants a &quot;global war&quot; against Al-Qaida.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their last meeting on 12 December 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="15">At that time, the American President, who was elected on the promise of bringing to an end the US' military involvement in the country, painted an optimistic picture of the situation.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has met several government officials and members of Congress.</seg>
		<seg id="17">On Thursday, he pleaded that the international community should conduct a &quot;third world war&quot; against Al-Qaida.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The principle of security aid for Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However, they have also criticized Shiite Nouri Al Maliki, saying he is partly responsible for the resumption of violence because of his &quot;sectarian and authoritarian policies&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They have also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that &quot;the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government constitutes a serious problem in the relationship between our two countries&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Vatican is to carry out a large-scale poll across the world on the way in which parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorces and same-sex couples.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The poll will ask participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage bonds.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The poll was sent out to every national conference of bishops in mid-October, with instructions to secure as many responses as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The information will be used at a major assembly on the family that Pope Francis is planning to organize next year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="6">A spokesperson for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way in which to approach parishioners.</seg>

		<seg id="0">New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking</seg>
		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches,&quot; Prof Cornell said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But mice who had not been given the vaccine &quot;chilled out,&quot; say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Officials announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise. The kitten must have come from abroad as France has not had any native cases of the disease since 2001.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The kitten was found in Argenteuil on 25 October and died on 28 October.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;An epidemiological inquiry was initiated to identify and treat any individuals who may have come into contact with the kitten between 08 to 28 October inclusive,&quot; say the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;Five people who had been in contact with the kitten have already been identified,&quot; and have received preventive treatment.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Preventive treatment for human rabies administered after contact with the carrier animal but before symptoms appear is very effective,&quot; the press release specifies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The ministries are currently asking anyone who might have been bitten, clawed, scratched or licked on a mucous membrane or on damaged skin by the kitten, or who own an animal that may have been in contact with the kitten between 08 to 28 October, to contact them on 08 11 00 06 95 between 10am and 6pm from 01 November.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;France has been clear of rabies since 2001. This kitten or the mother were imported from another country where it is still present,&quot; says the press release.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded 'native' case of rabies was in December 1998 in a fox and that &quot;France was officially declared free of this disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in November 2001.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">A case of rabies in a bitch illegally imported from the Gambia was recorded in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Rabies is a fatal disease if not treated promptly,&quot; the ministries reminded, and it can be transmitted during the fortnight or so before the first symptoms of the disease appear.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10.</seg>
		<seg id="3">However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.</seg>
		<seg id="5">She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women's jail.</seg>
		<seg id="7">She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;It's obviously been a worrying time but we're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible,&quot; Tunks said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Google is accused of infringing seven patents.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy,&quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane's door closes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win,&quot; Glading said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air,&quot; Rosenker said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.</seg>
		<seg id="40">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot;airplane&quot; mode.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,&quot; it said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes,&quot; a spokesman said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that,&quot; it said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes,&quot; the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs.</seg>
		<seg id="3">One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.</seg>
		<seg id="7">State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Kids may say, &quot;It feels like something is poking my tongue,&quot; &quot;My tongue feels like there is hair on it,&quot; or &quot;My tongue is tingling.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, holding in Ottawa this week, comes several days after the vote in favour of the bill on medically-assisted death in Quebec.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Several palliative care associations used the opportunity to restate their disapproval.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;If every ill person had access to effective care to relieve their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very  few of them would wish to end their lives,&quot; said a spokesperson for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The Chairperson of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medically-assisted death.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations if it is adopted.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; she laments.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice-president of the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes, Suzanne Fitzback.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Halloween 2013: By the Numbers</seg>
		<seg id="1">When I was little, Halloween was magical.</seg>
		<seg id="2">My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Nowadays, I've become more of a scrooge.</seg>
		<seg id="4">I haven't signed up for the past two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won't this year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But stats show that I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.</seg>
		<seg id="19">That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.</seg>
		<seg id="20">That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
		<seg id="23">That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It's a mystery I have yet to solve.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.</seg>
		<seg id="26">They have the best names, like &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which, by the way is in an actual prison), &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot;nice face.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">Finally, let's talk pumpkins.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Lucky for us, the &quot;baby in a pumpkin trend&quot; started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
		<seg id="33">If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.</seg>

		<seg id="0">DRC: Army Attacks Last Rebel Stronghold</seg>
		<seg id="1">The diehards of the M23, who are several hundreds in number, had entrenched themselves at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres in the farmland hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located around 80km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;The fighting has not stopped since morning and is continuing despite the darkness,&quot; a resident of Jomba, according to whom a little girl had been injured by gunfire in the morning, told the AFP by telephone at around 12.30pm.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;The fighting has slightly reduced in intensity. It appears that the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) have pushed the rebels back a bit,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to this witness, who chose to remain anonymous, the soldiers had &quot;spent the night&quot; in Jomba, before going into action for a &quot;combing operation&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The rattle of gunfire from light arms could clearly be heard in the background.</seg>
		<seg id="6">From Bunagana, a political stronghold and last preserve of the rebellion to fall on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear the detonation of heavy arms.</seg>
		<seg id="7">According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), the fighting has entered &quot;the final phase&quot;: the FARDC has &quot;surrounded the remaining M23 positions to flush them out&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since the resumption on Friday of confrontations between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO has not been participating directly in the fighting, but it is providing government's troops with critical support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At the end of the afternoon, several dozen well-equipped soldiers headed off towards the front.</seg>
		<seg id="10">They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, the frontier post with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded up a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new truck belonging to the FARDC, intended to take over from another device pounding the positions of the M23 in the hills.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, called on the rebels once again on Wednesday to &quot;stand down voluntarily&quot; or be disarmed &quot;by force&quot;, while leaving open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been in discussions since December with no outcome as yet.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The political leaders of the M23 are hoping to reach an agreement there.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;We have finished the talks. The Ugandan mediators just need to organize the signing,&quot; asserted Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, although this information could not be confirmed immediately with the government.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The M23 was born of an April 2012 mutiny by former rebels, principally Tutsis who were integrated into the army in 2009 following a peace agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23. Kigali and Kampala have denied the accusations.</seg>
		<seg id="17">North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas of the DRC, and its land abounds in coveted mineral resources.</seg>
		<seg id="18">At Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, to which around 5,000 people fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the process of returning which started in the morning was reversed at midday.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;This morning we went back across the border to go back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to go back,&quot; the AFP was told by Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The gunfire seems to be getting closer to the population.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Early that evening, dozens of residents were crossing the border, some with mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.</seg>

		<seg id="1">With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want peace back; we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with &quot;we demand security&quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his &quot;attractive special adviser,&quot; Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and &quot;door-stepped&quot; her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say,&quot; Mr Edis said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.</seg>
		<seg id="8">What about the first?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Does he know about phone hacking?</seg>
		<seg id="10">He says he doesn't, we say &quot;Oh yes, he did&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: &quot;Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as &quot;Projects.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.</seg>

		<seg id="0">$325m rescue package for Tassie health</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent action&quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state,&quot; Ms Plibersek said today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.</seg>
		<seg id="6">An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania's health system,&quot; Ms Plibersek said.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little &quot;unless it's followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I'm hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state's public health system off the critical list,&quot; Mr Wilkie said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a &quot;band-aid solution.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system,&quot; he told ABC TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">You can't have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care</seg>
		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">There aren't many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Cast your vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; Georges Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It's not easy,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some people can die because they are waiting.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Their luck doesn't always hold out.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We are receiving 500 people in each trip,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;This will change my future with my family,&quot; the man said.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I'm not sure when he sleeps,&quot; said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; O'Malley said.</seg>
		<seg id="56">That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He's a hero, without a doubt,&quot; O'Malley said.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I am doing this work,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think about my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I am doing.</seg>
		<seg id="66">To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Pierre Nora's Two Frances</seg>
		<seg id="1">Perplexed by his work, academics have long struggled to define and place Pierre Nora.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Is he a professor in lecture halls and classrooms?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Of course, but with emphasis on his fondness for byroads, at Sciences-Po (French Institute of Political Sciences), and Hautes Etudes (School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences).</seg>
		<seg id="4">Does he play an arbiter of the work of others from his office in Rue Gaston-Gallimard?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Yes, but while ignoring his lesser known work and underground writing as an editor.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Is he the heir to Fontenelle's chair at the Académie Française?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Yes again, but he knows that such an honour cannot replace the real holy oil, the philosophical work, which he has foregone.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They have gladly acknowledged him as a great awakener, a driving force, a unifier of their work, but observed that he seemed disinclined to produce such work himself.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The monumental &quot;Lieux de mémoire&quot; (places of memory), to which his name is attached, has also contributed to this unclear image.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Scandal-mongers have regarded this work as a gigantic &quot;flea market&quot;, presented by an intelligent and very learned commentator with a keen eye, but who is an incurable &quot;dabbler&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The two works published by Nora almost two years ago have already proven that though he appeared not to write, he had written - plentifully and well.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This book should definitively do him justice.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, once again, there is a tendency towards ubiquity, intellectual roaming, jubilation in jumping, as if with both feet tied,from one subject to another.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Nevertheless, one quickly understands that the disparate objects gathered together in this beautifully titled book lead the &quot;second-hand goods dealer&quot; to a constant passion, that of discovering the core that makes up the French identity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Why these dramatic appeals for national unity?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Identity is a contemporary preoccupation.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Not long ago, we were asked to collectively define it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But, in the peremptory minds of our former leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.</seg>
		<seg id="19">All it took was to highlight its mistakes and, in keeping with Jacobinism, the issue would be entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects - the authorised interpreters.</seg>
		<seg id="20">What Pierre Nora is searching for is something else.</seg>
		<seg id="21">He does not position himself as an heir to an eternal Frenchness; he rejects the definition.</seg>
		<seg id="22">As an analyst anxious about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stops after each step to examine an object in the form of a puzzle, tormented by irritating questions,</seg>
		<seg id="23">such as this, which arises from the undertaking itself: why, in a country so permanently established within its frontiers, with such an ancient structure and that is so solidly built, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?</seg>
		<seg id="24">The calls are pressing only because of the need to ward off the trouble caused by discord in French history, says Nora.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division in this country are very ancient.</seg>
		<seg id="26">And the most emblematic is clearly that which split national history in two:</seg>
		<seg id="27">since the upheaval of the Revolution, the French have had two histories and two nations - one monarchic, the other revolutionary.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The second tried to kill off the first, but failed to wipe it out; on the contrary, it was wary of letting it rediscover its sacredness and was so eager for unity and indivisibility that it cut off the head of the person who was the evident and powerful incarnation of the two.</seg>
		<seg id="29">And from there was born an invincibly bipartite nation, split into left and right, lay and Catholic, adoration and hatred for the Revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To understand this unique aspect of the French identity, there is nothing better than taking a short trip outside of metropolitan France, so much so that Pierre Nora's American venture could be the heart of his book.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This is because America and France have both had a revolution, drawn up a declaration of rights, and tried to found a new society.</seg>
		<seg id="32">However, our familiarity with America only emphasises even more something that is particular to us.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Over there, people abandoned their former rulers in England and did not have to bother about them any more.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Here, people were bothered by a native old power, and were all the more radical for it.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Over there, the revolution was consensual, whereas here it engendered tragedy and conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There, the founding fathers are still honoured, but here, our revolutionary ancestors are hardly used as role models, besides, they killed each other.</seg>
		<seg id="37">There, there has been institutional consistency; here there has been a torrent of constitutions, so many mistakes to correct and tests to repeat:</seg>
		<seg id="38">the France on the way out, the France in the making.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, there has been a time when the French believed they could repair the damage done to their history and overcome the curse of the number two.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Pierre Nora has shown has shown great interest and even tenderness for this Third Republic: he salutes those who tried at the time to repair the divide created by the Revolution by teaching students about everything in the former France that obscurely paved the way for the modern France, and by offering them a unified version of their history.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Yet, this pacified identity has had its day.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Here we are in debate once again, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the inflow of protesting minorities, absorbed into the European framework.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The book thus offers both a fascinating portrait of the France on the way out, and a circumspect outline of the France in the making.</seg>
		<seg id="44">And, on top of that, there is the portrait of the historian, which should hold some surprises.</seg>
		<seg id="45">It reveals that the wanderer liked to stay at home.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The man of many curiosities is - slightly obsessively - focused on a single idea.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The one who prowled at the edges was standing in the heart of the centre.</seg>
		<seg id="48">And the man who rejected a notion of a nation over half a century ago, but who escaped from the initiatory exercise of the philosophical work, confides in us, cum grano salis, that he has ended up doing it after all.</seg>
		<seg id="49">And so he has, but in a less formal, and more exploded and subtle form.</seg>
		<seg id="50">A form, which - make no mistake - is just as restrictive,</seg>
		<seg id="51">because, over and above the format imposed in the university course, this philosophical work speaks of the inner necessity of a life.</seg>

		<seg id="0">How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives</seg>
		<seg id="1">Is it the end of passwords to access a smartphone or pay for purchases?</seg>
		<seg id="2">US, French and Japanese researchers are predicting a future where we will be recognised by biometric sensors on telephones and computers.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Bernard Didier, vice-president of Morpho, believes this will be the &quot;century of biometrics&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Biometrics will be the only way of guaranteeing the identity of an individual carrying out transactions in a world as transverse and transnational as the Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Organisations devoted to privacy protection note this fascination for biometrics, but are concerned.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In France alone in 2011, the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties authorised 774 imprint recognition systems, for recognising fingerprints, the shape of the hand or networks of veins in the hand, for businesses, institutions, cafeterias, etc.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Everyone will soon be identifiable, anywhere and any time,&quot; says a concerned Justin Brookman, consumer privacy director for the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But why such optimism for some and pessimism for others?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Biometrics will rely on new technologies that will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In France today, the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints, hand geometry and the network of veins in the palm or fingers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But each of these techniques has its limitations.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;For example, people who work with cement have damage to their fingers that renders their fingerprints unreadable,&quot; notes Philippe Robin, technical director for identification at Thales Communications &amp; Security.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Furthermore, the detection and verification of a network of veins or of hand geometry require a voluntary and specific gesture on the part of individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is both a security mechanism - this data cannot be captured without people knowing - and an inconvenience - the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and so takes time.</seg>
		<seg id="15">As a consequence, research has been conducted over the past twenty years into other methods, such as face or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Thanks to the improved precision of the sensors and the calculating capacity of the computers used to analyse this data, these techniques are becoming practical.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The accuracy of face recognition has improved tenfold over the past five years, considers Cyrille Bataller, R&amp;D laboratory director at Accenture in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automated passport gates that use face recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;Today we are carrying out research into voice and gait recognition using sonic sensors, but it requires a silent environment,&quot; says Sridhar Lyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.</seg>
		<seg id="21">DNA, a unique and unfalsifiable marker, also arouses hope and concern.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;With the current state of knowledge, it could be considered the ultimate in biometric data,&quot; confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of research, innovation and forecasting at the CNIL.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But DNA analysis still takes a long time and is expensive.</seg>
		<seg id="24">NEC is offering the judicial police a portable pack costing 90,000 euros that can analyse DNA samples on a crime scene within an hour.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognition of one person amongst others) and authentication (confirmation that a person is who they say they are).</seg>
		<seg id="26">Until now, identification has consisted of the provision of identity papers: biometric systems (fingerprints, photos, iris, etc.) will have to be given access to information that the state holds on every citizen already on file.</seg>
		<seg id="27">This will provide assurance that someone is not trying to usurp the identity of another.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This principle of comparison can be used for other purposes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">NEC is therefore proposing VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;We are gathering images from surveillance cameras and comparing them with photos of celebrities that are freely available on the Internet,&quot; explains Dany Nassif, business development director for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Another use is to take a photo of someone queuing in a shop, follow his progress using face recognition and work out the waiting time.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Authentication initially concerned physical (at borders, in protected locations, in a cafeteria etc.) or digital presence (logging on to a computer).</seg>
		<seg id="33">Added to this, more recently, are presence checks.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;A biometric timekeeper prevents the situation where one colleague clocks in on behalf of another,&quot; asserts Cyrille Bataller from Accenture.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But, more and more, authentication will also involve transactions, in particular those carried out using devices connected to the Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some cash machines by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the use of a PIN.</seg>
		<seg id="37">A similar technique is being tested at Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Angoulême by the company Natural Security, in partnership with banks and major retailers: at the point of paying with a card in a shop, the customer does not enter a code - they place a finger in a reader, which scans the veins.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The experiment is expected to last six months.</seg>
		<seg id="39">If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon be seen in shops in France.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Ways to reassure users</seg>
		<seg id="41">There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The first is to explain how it can save time.</seg>
		<seg id="43">&quot;If a customer spends thirty seconds less at a till thanks to biometrics, it would be nice,&quot; says the manager of a major store.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The second is to offer personalised services: in a few years a voice server will be able to recognise your voice and offer you customised options.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Finally, the public can be reassured by highlighting the measures implemented to protect databases.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;Digital fingerprints are stored in a primary server; the identities of individuals are in a second database. The correlation between the two sets of information is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which locks up if anyone tries to move it,&quot; specifies Philippe Robin from Thales.</seg>
		<seg id="47">However, given the lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if this line will really convince users.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Privacy protection specialists continue to be concerned.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;The advances in face recognition, the increase in the number of surveillance cameras and the huge number of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,&quot; predicts Andrew Patrick from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We don't want to charge that,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he said, &quot;and it boarded lickety-split.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It will still give away water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: &quot;It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we attempted to look at it in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other</seg>
		<seg id="9">Prof Vallortigara said: &quot;We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He said: &quot;If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.</seg>

		<seg id="2">This is what inspired a consultation exercise between parents, students, teachers and staff of the education department a year ago to reflect on ways to improve the integration of students who have roots in several cultures.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The School Board has just unveiled its vision of &quot;Living Together in French&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The organisation, called Vision Diversité, has been visiting schools for the past year to help students of every origin find common reference points that are not limited to the French language.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop tapping the lines of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, said an American official on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This decision is part of attempts by the White House to resume control of the NSA phone-tapping affair following revelations by the former analyst, Edward Snowden, who has taken refuge in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This is the first time that surveillance of the IMF and World Bank by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.</seg>
		<seg id="4">When asked about this, an official of the American administration replied: &quot;The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance aimed at offices of the World Bank and IMF in Washington.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Talking under the cloak of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had taken place in the past.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another official indicated that Barack Obama had given the order to stop these practices during recent weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The instruction was given at almost the same time as that putting an end to phone-tapping of the UN headquarters in New York.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In this regard, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved strengthening of the controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday, but still authorised them to proceed.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The major European stock markets, except London, are on a down trend in mid-session this Friday. They are being dragged down by disappointing news from businesses, while Wall Street is expected to experience a rise.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Also, investors are still treading with caution, as they believe that the American Federal Reserve might end its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the other hand, following the announcement of a 0.7% inflation throughout the eurozone, the idea that the European Central Bank (ECB) might relax its monetary policy has been spreading amongst actors in the market .</seg>
		<seg id="4">Futures on Wall Street are suggesting that opening price of US shares will rise, following two consecutive sessions marked by a downward trend.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On the securities market, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the greatest drop with the CAC 40, weighed down by the profit warning issued by its partner, Nissan Motor, on Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) recorded the worst performance in the EuroFirst300, after also reporting a decline in earnings this morning and announcing the creation of an internal bad bank structure covering £38 000 million of its highest risk assets.</seg>
		<seg id="7">On its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) is still leading the upward trend in the EuroFirst300 in response to a press release indicating that AT&amp;T was looking at a possible takeover bid.</seg>

		<seg id="6">This, in parallel with the artistic dimension, was a benefit event which helps the non-profit organisation achieve financial balance-sheet that sounds as soothing to the ear as a tune from Die Fledermaus.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would be hunting down M23 rebels right up to their bases located in the forests and mountains of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The M23 appears to be on the verge of defeat, having been driven out of the towns in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC), which it had been in control of since the start of the uprising 20 months ago.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;We will pursue the M23 and drive it out of wherever it is hiding because they are criminals,&quot; Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the FARDC, declared to Reuters.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We must not allow them to regroup because they have been making the Congolese people suffer for too long.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The time has come for peace to be restored.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Leaders of the M23 say they evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bisimwa, political leader of the rebellion, asserted on RFI that these military setbacks would not change its demands at the peace talks in any way.</seg>
		<seg id="7">According to the Ugandan mediators,talks between the government in Kinshasa and the M23 resumed in Kampala on Wednesday,.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Skirmishes were reported in the hills above Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the rebels to fall this week, and around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion started in 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the retreat of the government garrison and the inaction of the Monusco blue berets.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the largest in the world in terms of numbers, to reinforce its mandate and form a rapid intervention force consisting of soldiers from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Meanwhile, FARDC staff has been reshuffled and the army has gone on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The rate of progress of the government troops today is unprecedented.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;The M23 seems to be nearing its end,&quot; predicted an expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa has succeeded in quashing a major insurrection.</seg>
		<seg id="15">And it would also be the first time since 1996 that there is no armed group allied to Rwanda present in the east of the RDC.</seg>
		<seg id="16">United Nations experts accuse Rwanda of providing military support to the M23, which has initially made up of mutinous former Congolese soldiers. Rwanda vehemently denies this.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, called on the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman announced.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation after shells landed in Rwandan territory.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana took to the streets of the town to welcome the entry of the FARDC troops.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;We have been living with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable that we would one day be freed by the army,&quot; said an inhabitant of the town on the border with Uganda.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;We have been living in terror [of the M23], we are traumatised,&quot; the man added.</seg>

		<seg id="0">John Kerry says US spying has &quot;reached too far inappropriately&quot; in unprecedented admission</seg>
		<seg id="1">John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has &quot;reached too far inappropriately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Secretary of State also admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on &quot;automatic pilot&quot; as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: &quot;There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: &quot;We're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors,&quot; Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs.</seg>
		<seg id="18">News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He said the itinerary is still being worked out.</seg>
		<seg id="24">While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some &quot;tough love&quot; will also be dispensed.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying,&quot; Murphy said.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After dramatically throwing in the towel in January over the partial taking over of the Goodyear site in Amiens North, which is due to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of American tire manufacturer, Titan, now says that he is ready to save 333 of the factory's 1,137 employees.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Industrial Recovery, had already announced this on Monday October 21.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January, today you are back.</seg>
		<seg id="4">You had fired violent attacks and insults, talking of 'so-called workers' who 'work three hours' a day, and 'mad' unions, targeting the CGT.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It's hard to understand this U-turn.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Is this meant to please Mr. Montebourg?</seg>
		<seg id="7">I'm not trying to please anyone.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Except my wife.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I'm sorry if my words have offended anyone.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there are high levels of tax and unemployment in France too.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Does the truth offend you?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Working seven hours a day when people in other countries are working eight hours is holding France back.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In India, China and many other countries, people work ten to twelve hours a day.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But I don't have prejudices about France.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What I see is a factory which manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, a good location and plenty of room for growth.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Why does Titan need this factory so much?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But, if the price is right and the workers are qualified, it's worth trying.</seg>
		<seg id="20">What sort of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?</seg>
		<seg id="21">If Goodyear had offered the employees a good severance package after announcing that the factory was closing, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Now, let's imagine that Titan buys a closed factory from Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="23">At that point, Titan could choose to move the machinery to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, he wants to keep the factory in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid employees.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Titan has agreed to recruit them from the 1,200 or so people currently working for Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit down with Goodyear.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all the employees.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Then there won't be any employees left in the factory.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr. Montebourg has said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Can you confirm that?</seg>
		<seg id="32">The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I know he would like a four-year guarantee.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But, as I said to you, the CGT and Goodyear must first reach an agreement on the severance pay.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If all the employees accept it, the project of buying Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees.</seg>
		<seg id="36">How can we give guarantees on the length of employment when there are no employees left on site?</seg>
		<seg id="37">If Mr. Montebourg gets the CGT and Goodyear to reach an agreement and Titan buys the factory, we have every intention of staying in Amiens North for more than four years.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A new class action claim has been filed against the brothers of the Congregation of the Holy Cross involving sexual assaults, allegedly carried out, this time, at the Saint-Joseph Oratory and several orphanages, colleges and schools.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The claim is based on the testimony of an applicant identified as &quot;J. J&quot;, who would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph Oratory, where he was an altar boy and where his father worked as a painter.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;The first action involved only three institutions, and when the ruling was announced, many people said to us: 'I was assaulted at so and so place, can I add my name?&quot; says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who is defending the victims in the two actions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The class action that has just been filed specifically enables the inclusion of plaintiffs from any institution where members of the Congregation of the Holy Cross may have been involved in abuses.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Currently, the action combines the complaints of 25 individuals who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers of the Holy Cross.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The alleged deeds generally took place before those cited in the first action as many of the institutions concerned were closed in the 1960s.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Moreover, the action specifies that the Congregation of the Holy Cross and the Saint-Joseph Oratory, which is a separate entity, &quot;allowed acts of sexual abuse to be committed against children&quot;, that they &quot;exercised moral, religious and psychological constraint over the victims,&quot; and that they &quot;knew about sexual assaults committed but kept quiet&quot; and &quot;deliberately and consciously chose to ignore the problem&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The latter accusations are partly based on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers of the Holy Cross, Mr Emile Perrin QC, in the 1990s, as well as through research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of the Holy Cross who has publicly denounced the abuses.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The class action must first be deemed admissible by the Superior Court.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Once the Court has declared it admissible, it will proceed to the second stage, the preliminary hearings.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the first action, the Congregation of the Holy Cross agreed to settle out of court before preliminary hearings were conducted.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Children play on a charred tank that belonged to M23 rebels, at Kibumba in the east of the DRC on 31 October 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On Friday the Congolese army was preparing a new assault on the final bastions of the M23 rebels close to Bunagana in the east of the DRC.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The aim of the assault is to flush the M23 out of the hills overlooking Bunagana.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Yesterday, we took Bugina hill, which overlooks Mbuzi hill.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Today, Mbuzi is expected to fall as well.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Then only Rumyoni hill will be left.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Chanzu hill is not strategic,&quot; the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Mr Paluku hopes to be in Bunagana on Saturday.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The town, which is a political stronghold and the final bastion of the rebellion, lies on the border with Uganda, around 80km north of Goma.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It was recaptured by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) on Wednesday.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Since then, several hundred M23 diehards have been cut off in the farmland hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the neighbouring town of Jomba, at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In Jomba, a local contact who had reported fighting at close quarters throughout Thursday said that the situation had been &quot;calm since this morning&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy</seg>
		<seg id="1">A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.</seg>
		<seg id="8">She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.</seg>
		<seg id="10">An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.</seg>
		<seg id="13">A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot;to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I think it's conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Germany must wake up,&quot; says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium sized German IT companies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Business leaders are sceptical about this.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;That's not the way,&quot; Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Everything but the IT industry.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: &quot;We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It has always taken place.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.</seg>
		<seg id="32">For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access,&quot; the BfV warns in a report.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.</seg>
		<seg id="41">A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="42">Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: &quot;The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Mr Cook said: &quot;Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning &quot;domestic market&quot; with the city's south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing an uptick, according to research from Savills.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The three major manufacturers in Detroit realised double-digit growth as compared to October 2012, but only General Motors performed better than expected.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Analysts had forecast average sales of 15.4 million units (annualised rate, adjusted with seasonal variations), but the market settled at 15.3 million, according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would &quot;bring the UK together.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was &quot;excited&quot; to work with the UK government on the plan.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; back Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on their birth certificates.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
		<seg id="7">An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.</seg>
		<seg id="11">New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good thing.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It's like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a &quot;third gender&quot; on their official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized &quot;genderless&quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot;unspecified&quot; gender status for life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for &quot;gender theory&quot; to be withdrawn from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that &quot;as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child,&quot; she told the parenting website.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one 1966 case, known as &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theories became controversial.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not,&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But at 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher said that now some doctors are still &quot;practicing that model.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward &quot;not happy with the outcome.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a &quot;satisfactory life&quot; as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He was given female hormones at age 12.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I wasn't a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he found out was horrifying.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Surgery rendered him infertile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;invites labeling and stigma.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid it will encourage intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="66">German law is about assigning it at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will &quot;empower&quot; both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves,&quot; said Baratz.</seg>
		<seg id="76">It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'</seg>
		<seg id="77">This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing.</seg>
		<seg id="82">It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism</seg>
		<seg id="3">Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks</seg>
		<seg id="4">Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It's called &quot;The Audacity to Win,&quot; and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was simply nothing I could have imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of &quot;don't ask don't tell,&quot; to the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I've reached a point of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the &quot;most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I don't know if this is what I should have expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing.</seg>
		<seg id="32">That is what troubles me most of all.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Still, as Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want us to get our mojo back,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We've got to remember who we are.'</seg>
		<seg id="42">It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators,&quot; the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
		<seg id="9">None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.</seg>
		<seg id="11">UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market.</seg>
		<seg id="13">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Banks are scouring through years&quot; worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks&quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot;you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained,&quot; Credit Suisse said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Now the New Express is to undergo &quot;full rectification,&quot; the regulator said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The &quot;rectification&quot; order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;New Express's editorial management was disordered,&quot; the regulator said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It said it had decided to &quot;impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's license.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">It had also &quot;instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express's leadership team.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.</seg>
		<seg id="11">After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust,&quot; he told state broadcaster CCTV.</seg>
		<seg id="14">I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I've realised my wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Obama's Health Care Walk Back</seg>
		<seg id="1">Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that &quot;if you like your health plan, you can keep it.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Addressing what he called the &quot;flurry in the news&quot; about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;You're going to get a better deal,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone &quot;miserably&quot; since October.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I am as frustrated and angry as anyone,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">I am eager to earn your confidence back.</seg>
		<seg id="13">An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Coen Brothers' Homage to Folk Music</seg>
		<seg id="1">&quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; by the Coen brothers, winners of the Grand Prix at the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic comedy set in Greenwich Village in 1961 and based on folk music, which was just budding there prior to the arrival of Bob Dylan.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has recently been the subject of a review at the &quot;Cinémathèque française&quot;, scooped the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 with Barton Fink.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Since they could not hire Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary trio, Joel and Ethan Coen opted for a rising American movie star, Oscar Isaac, aged 33, and global pop star Justin Timberlake.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In this film bursting with humour, where the music is a central character and the songs are performed live, Oscar Isaac proved himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, abandons pop for folk music with contagious glee.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Carey Mulligan, in turn, abandons the wealthy trappings of Daisy Buchanan in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; for less glitzy clothes; her singing voice is soft, but her language very coarse when she speaks.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; tells the story of a week of tribulations for a folk singer who has failed to get a break and is angry with the whole world.</seg>
		<seg id="7">He reluctantly accepts last minute stand-in roles at studios.</seg>
		<seg id="8">With nowhere to live, he sleeps on the couches of friends who will still have him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Documentary-style</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;His relationship with success is tortured, and that's what interested us: a mix of bad luck and a guy who's never in the right place at the right time, not career-orientated, but honest, with a tendency towards self-destruction,&quot; Ethan Coen, who, with his brother Joel, has won several Oscars and Cannes prizes, told the press.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Even though Llewyn Davis never existed, the two directors, who are folk music fans, based their story on real people of the time, such as folk musician Dave Van Ronk.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The idea was to portray the moment preceding the advent of Greenwich Village, the New York district destined to become &quot;the epicentre of the folk music boom that created international stars&quot;, according to the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The film has the feel of a documentary, from the fusty record label overrun with unsold LPs and inhabited by a priceless old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the day and the cafés where the singers performed.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Coen brothers' magic continues to work by integrating a comical character who is permanently on screen: a magnificent, cute ginger cat who is Llewyn Davis' companion in fate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Asked how he had developed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled how he &quot;grew up in Tennessee, bathed in the blues and country music&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather. He taught me to play the guitar,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Timberlake says that although you have to work &quot;to be considered good...luck can also launch your career...more and more so today&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star says that in a career, &quot;the most important thing is to avoid getting trapped by things that prevent us from expressing ourselves&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="0">NSA Spying: The United States &quot;went too far,&quot; Kerry admits</seg>
		<seg id="1">The United States sometimes went &quot;too far&quot; with its espionage activities, Secretary of State John Kerry recognised in the first admission from Washington, which is deep in controversy with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).</seg>
		<seg id="2">After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that an official of the American government has explicitly admitted controversial activities in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;In certain cases, I acknowledge, as does the President, that some of these activities went too far and we guarantee that this will not happen in the future,&quot; declared John Kerry at a conference in London that he was participating in from Washington via a video link on Thursday October 31.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In his relayed speech, and in the presence of his British counterpart, William Hague, the head of the American diplomatic service justified at length the intelligence practices and collection of data as part of the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Citing the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since thwarted numerous planned attacks thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of data.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We have prevented planes being brought down, buildings being blown up and people being murdered, because we have been able to stay informed prior to these attacks,&quot; the head of the American diplomatic service argued.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Furthermore, John Kerry stated in his address to the Europeans, &quot;I assure you that no innocent person has been misled during this process.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">Yet America strives to collate data.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;Yes, in certain cases, this went too far in an inappropriate manner,&quot; the Secretary of State again admitted, having already had to make a statement on the international scandal during a tour in Paris, London and Rome last week.</seg>
		<seg id="10">On Thursday evening, he asserted that President Obama had &quot;resolved to try to clarify the matter and had initiated a re-examination of these practices to ensure that no-one felt misled&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the controversy between the Americans and Europeans continued to grow this week with new revelations in the press.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to the Washington Post, the NSA has been intercepting data of hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained by the former NSA consultant, Edward Snowden, stated that the programme dubbed &quot;MUSCULAR&quot; and conducted in conjunction with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, enabled the two agencies to gather data from the fibre-optic cables used by Internet giants.</seg>
		<seg id="14">According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the month of January alone - ranging from meta data on emails to text elements or audio and video files.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These interceptions apparently took place outside the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="16">However, Yahoo and Google have denied any involvement in these practices.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For ten days now, a number of major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have been revealing that the NSA had intercepted massive quantities of data and communications emanating from allies of the United States and their leaders, in particular the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Following the outrage of the European states, and even though leaks to the American press stated that the American President was not up-to-date with these spying activities, Barack Obama has refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He even pointed the finger back at the European intelligence services who allegedly got hold of these communications before passing them on to the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This concerned &quot;military operations&quot; in countries where the NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and this absolutely did not target Europe, according to General Alexander.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The discord spread to Asia on Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network, which has also aroused the ire of China.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: Growing older sooner</seg>
		<seg id="1">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent</seg>
		<seg id="3">There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;precocious&quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are important, too.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, &quot;suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls' feelings of being different from peers.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Yet, there's no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are varying explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation,&quot; Kaplowitz advised.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was kidnapped on 08 March 1986, along with three members of his Antenne 2 team who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration, and was set free almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.</seg>
		<seg id="2">He retired in 2008, but in 2004 he helped set up a hostage defence association, &quot;Otages du Monde&quot; (&quot;Hostages of the World&quot;), which he has been running for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The main objective of the association is to make it possible for hostages to press charges and bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Four AQMI (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) hostages, Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret, were freed on Tuesday after being held for over 1,000 days.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Following medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have now been reunited with their families.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Now they can gradually try to resume their lives.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; interviewed 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, a former senior reporter who retired in 2008 and is president of the association &quot;Otages du Monde&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">On the evening you were set free, you appeared on the mid-evening news on Antenne 2.</seg>
		<seg id="9">What are your memories of being set free today?</seg>
		<seg id="10">On the ground specifically, in Beirut?</seg>
		<seg id="11">The day I was set free, I was in the boot of a car where I met Roger Auque - although I couldn't see him as it was dark.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He said &quot;We're free,&quot; but I wasn't sure and thought we might still be killed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">We were very excited, but also very tense.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It was in the middle of a war and the people driving us too were very tense.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They dropped us off on a pavement.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There were Syrian soldiers there.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We were then taken to the Hotel Summerland where the press had gathered.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Some Frenchmen took us to the French Embassy.</seg>
		<seg id="19">That was when I made my first call to my parents, my family, my friends, the press and so on.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I remember taking a one-hour bath,</seg>
		<seg id="21">and having dinner in a T-shirt at the French Embassy.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I also remember a short night spent talking to Roger and Marchiani.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It was still tense as there was no way of evacuating us to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.</seg>
		<seg id="24">We got there by helicopter and took a private plane to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua got on board.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How were you received when you got to French soil?</seg>
		<seg id="26">We landed at Orly.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Chirac, the Prime Minister, was there.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It was a bit rough,</seg>
		<seg id="29">the jostling was unbelievable.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And there was a lot of media.</seg>
		<seg id="31">When I left the country, there were three television channels -</seg>
		<seg id="32">when I got back there were loads of them.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Coming down the steps of the aeroplane, being reunited with my son and parents, my friends, that was all very emotional.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Numerous motorbikes followed our car, which was driven by Roussin, from the airport to my home.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The bikes were jostling to get in front and take photos. They followed me all the way home, where I had to do some policing to stop some of them climbing up.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The media pressure was huge.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It wouldn't stop and we were well placed to know that...</seg>
		<seg id="38">Yet, the level of emotion and fatigue made it difficult to think clearly.</seg>
		<seg id="39">You come out of a hole and are suddenly in the spotlight of the media.</seg>
		<seg id="40">It's a bit complicated, a bit of a shock, quite difficult to handle.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But we'd been through the hardest part.</seg>
		<seg id="42">I was on the mid-evening news that same evening, and on TV the following day as well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Then a very gentle sort of readjustment to life started, lasting one or two months that were a bit like a holiday.</seg>
		<seg id="44">How did the medical examinations and the debriefing with the DGSE (Directorate General for External Security) go?</seg>
		<seg id="45">I had to undergo an initial medical check in Corsica.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The other tests were carried out in Val-de-Grâce in the days after my return: X-rays, examinations of every type, and an appointment with a psychiatrist.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Everything can't be sorted out in one appointment, but you know you can count on the psychiatrist, call on him if needed, that you have not been abandoned to yourself.</seg>
		<seg id="48">It is all part of the process.</seg>
		<seg id="49">I also met with the intelligence services.</seg>
		<seg id="50">They asked me a lot of questions about the hostage-takers.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It was normal.</seg>
		<seg id="52">It didn't bother me.</seg>
		<seg id="53">How do you react today to the liberation of the four hostages in Niger?</seg>
		<seg id="54">I'm listening to what's being said.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Especially the debate about ransoms.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Some things annoy me, others less so.</seg>
		<seg id="57">I try to distinguish between the questions about my past as a hostage and my role as president of the association &quot;Otages du Monde&quot;, which enables me to keep a distance and seems to me more interesting to deal with.</seg>
		<seg id="58">For example, I think about the definition of resilience.</seg>
		<seg id="59">And, I fight, alongside other people, for the recognition of the legal status of hostages.</seg>
		<seg id="60">I think there is a problem of semantics.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We need to qualify hostage-taking as &quot;political&quot; hostage-taking - that's what it is for the most part - and enable the hostages to have access to justice, to press charges and to bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Today, once again, everyone is wrapped up in compassion, emotion and is rejoicing that the hostages are free.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But who is saying that the hostages may also have access to justice?</seg>
		<seg id="64">The court in The Hague has been set up for that purpose.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Why should we not say to the hostage-takers: &quot;You have flouted the rules of war and those of all the Geneva Conventions, we're going to bring you to justice&quot;?</seg>
		<seg id="66">I think that is justified, legitimate, plain common sense.</seg>
		<seg id="67">People hear the message, but do not listen, and that shocks me.</seg>
		<seg id="68">That's my main struggle.</seg>

		<seg id="2">In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office offered to provide exceptional, provisional rehousing for the couple and their three children in a new four-room house.</seg>
		<seg id="3">However, the family refused &quot;for financial reasons&quot; and the situation is at stalemate.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The matter has become exaggerated,&quot; thinks Joël Canapa, office director.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;There have always been rats in towns.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The rat extermination company conducts two operations per year. Furthermore, we intervene at our own cost whenever there is a complaint from residents.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hence we have carried out 64 operations since last winter.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The area has not been abandoned and rats are not swarming into the town.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Due to environmental protection and public health concerns, rat extermination products are four times less efficient than in the past, but we are not going to kill a kid for the sake of two rats.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;We didn't invite the rats in,&quot; counters the father of the family, which left its home and moved into a hotel.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;We will soon be penniless and we are waiting for a new house at the same rate as the old one.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank structure to cover £38 billion (€45,000 million) of its highest risk assets, a step designed to improve its relations with the City and accelerate its re-privatisation.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another independence scare story.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
		<seg id="4">True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So, a non-story, then.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; canard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All the wage freezes in the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here's my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose &quot;Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations&quot; favoured by General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Where does this leave Scotland?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">End of the Road for Elysée Head Chef</seg>
		<seg id="1">Having entered the 500m2-space of the kitchens at the Elysée Palace as an assistant after working in embassies, the cook climbed up the ladder to become head chef nine years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="2">He has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, including at their holiday homes, and fed an uncountable number of world figures, surrounded by a cloud of anonymity that he has only emerged from today, as he retires at 60.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Born on 24 October 1953 in La Ferté-Saint-Aubin, the man with an open face, a balding head and the glasses of an intellectual is the holder of a certificate of professional competence in confectionery.</seg>
		<seg id="4">His mother was a cook in a château in Sologne.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;I've moved from one château to another!&quot; says Bernard Vaussion ironically. He is familiar, not only with the habits of the six presidents for whom he has cooked, but also with those of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;It's always the Head of State or his partner or wife who chooses the menu,&quot; he recalls.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Madame Chirac was a little more involved and would come right into the kitchen,&quot; to the point where she forbade women to enter the kitchens in the Elysée Palace!</seg>
		<seg id="8">With all due respect to heads of state who appeared relatively indifferent to fruits of the earth, &quot;they are all fond of food&quot; Bernard Vaussion reveals graciously.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jacques Chirac certainly had a &quot;more refined palate&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who forbade cheese, the plates always came back empty!</seg>
		<seg id="11">François Hollande, who reintroduced cheese, is &quot;a man who likes to eat&quot; and &quot;he is not very choosy&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The current Head of State, who has put back on the pounds he lost during the presidential campaign, does &quot;not have a specific diet requirement&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure that would rest on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elysée, where one had to serve &quot;between 200 and 250 people in around an hour&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The night before would be practically sleepless.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Such people would not understand if something went wrong.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The now former head chef at the Elysée, who shared a drink on Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, is leaving with a twinge of sorrow. &quot;François Hollande came to say goodbye.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">He was full of praise.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;His human side came out,&quot; he recalls.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The chef will be replaced by his assistant, 35-year-old Guillaume Gomez, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years himself.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After the police confirmed that they laid hands on a copy of a video allegedly showing Rob Ford smoking crack, Barrister Clayton Ruby maintained that he has never seen an investigation &quot;so botched&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The barrister said to the Canadian Press that he believes the police had &quot;ignored or downplayed&quot; evidence against the mayor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional chauffeur, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and charged him with extortion in relation with the video.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Lisi, who has previously been accused of drug trafficking, was frequently in contact with the mayor.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The police said they have also observed him delivering parcels to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Ruby says it is &quot;inexplicable&quot; that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his telephone, saying that chief of police Bill Blair knowingly decided not to act against the mayor.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In accordance with the law, the police, having themselves witnessed suspicious transactions, could have intercepted Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor and carried out a search - even without a warrant.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if this was considered necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The chief of police has not commented. However, his spokesman, Mark Pugash, has described Ruby's statements as &quot;an obvious and desperate attempt&quot; to sell himself to the media in a matter that does not concern him at all.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that might constitute a &quot;reasonable motive&quot; that could lead to criminal charges being brought against the mayor.</seg>

		<seg id="3">The expert, who was dispatched to the scene by the public prosecutor's office, stated that the cause of the explosion was purely accidental.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a gas leak and a build-up of gas.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and partner, was by her side and suffered less serious burns.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in your car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The tea party is aghast.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This really is a must for our nation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It is not a matter of something we might choose to do,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars get many more miles to the gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gas tax is just not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not just a tax going into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People are paying more directly into what they are getting.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has already completed a pilot.</seg>
		<seg id="36">New York City is looking into one.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It was not something people wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="43">As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="49">It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,&quot; the spy agency said in an emailed statement.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The issue will be resolved this evening.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was &quot;not at all&quot; compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="7">No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.</seg>
		<seg id="9">DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.</seg>

		<seg id="11">The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Charlie, founder of the &quot;Lick Me I'm Delicious&quot; ice cream company, said: &quot;It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
		<seg id="11">So each scoop costs me around £140.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It tastes pretty good though.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He said: &quot;I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists</seg>

		<seg id="1">Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities.</seg>
		<seg id="2">German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him testifying in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: &quot;Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, speaking the truth is not a crime.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness &quot;without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US,&quot; it should be taken.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.</seg>
		<seg id="13">If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be &quot;safe&quot; there, the MP said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a &quot;severe and sustained&quot; campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.</seg>
		<seg id="15">However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to &quot;my act of political expression.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A team of biologists working for the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new humpback dolphin species living off the northern coast of Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Thibaut Bouveroux, in charge of the scientific mission at the Observatoire pour la Conservation et l'Etude des Animaux et Milieux Marins (OCEAMM), discussed this discovery with L'Express and explains the long process of identifying new species.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Did the discovery of this new humpback dolphin species surprise you?</seg>
		<seg id="3">It's good news, but it didn't surprise me especially.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In the past, species have been described and identified on the basis of morphology, anatomy and geography. Today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of the science of the classification of species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Moreover, there is a possibility that these advances in genetics and molecular biology may call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a particular genus, family or even order.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of the morphological differences between species.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today, some of these classifications have been questioned as a result of advances in genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Likewise, two species that are very similar in morphology were distinguished using genetics.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.</seg>
		<seg id="10">About a decade ago, scientists recognised two species that belonged to this sub-family: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Recent analyses have enabled four species to be distinguished.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Why is this a significant discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society says?</seg>
		<seg id="13">From the point of view of conservation, it is essential to be aware of genetic differences so a species and, thus, its genetic variability can be protected.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Researchers have known about this population for a long time, but they did not know that it was part of a new species that only lives in this location.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hence, in the event of large-scale mortality in the region, caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture, we would know that we are dealing with the extinction of a species rather than the local disappearance of a population belonging to a much more widespread species.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Such loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A species is considered to be threatened or endangered based on the number of its members alive on the planet, known as the stock, and of the possibility of the species restoring itself using neighbouring stocks.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The stock of the Sousa Chinensis species, from which the newly discovered population derives, has automatically grown weaker, making it more vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Why is it rare to discover new marine mammal species?</seg>
		<seg id="20">Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This blending of genes limits the creation of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="23">On the other hand, more enclosed ecosystems favour genetic isolation, which can ultimately lead to the creation of new species.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It should be noted that the marine environment is the least known of environments.</seg>
		<seg id="25">We prefer sending robots to Mars rather than knowing what is living in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometres below the surface of the ocean.</seg>
		<seg id="26">More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it is high time things changed.</seg>

		<seg id="13">Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn't like it?</seg>

		<seg id="6">His case follows that of Lance Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been forced to leave before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared for his departure, with planning and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the army.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;I told them I wasn't ready,&quot; he said in an interview with La Presse Canadienne on Wednesday.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;For several months, I asked if there was a way that I could stay on, and they said no,&quot; he adds.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Since the start of major combat in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to stay in the army but are not capable of combat.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployment, they can be forced to leave the army.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The data presented to parliament last year indicates that, of the 1,218 soldiers discharged for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Wednesday, the liberal spokesman for former service personnel, Jim Karygiannis, asked for Lance Corporal Hawkins to be reinstated, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris demanded an immediate end to &quot;this shameful practice&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped businesses and managers win contracts, loans and promotions in exchange for money or gifts, the Primary Intermediate Court in Beijing declared on its microblog.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to &quot;sector perform&quot; from &quot;outperform&quot; on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation,&quot; Doerksen said in a client note.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated,&quot; Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That will happen all through the flight program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15,&quot; said Doerksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment,&quot; Beaudoin said.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?&quot; the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,&quot; said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He said the new media tribunal &quot;will always be biased because it's an extension of the government,&quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot;a stranglehold over the media,&quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been &quot;dealt a major blow&quot; and lambasted the bill as &quot;draconian.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot;de-listed,&quot; or barred from receiving official press accreditation.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to the Daily Nation, &quot;even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's &quot;lively blogosphere.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;No one will ever know,&quot; wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering,&quot; he wrote.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Make no mistake,</seg>
		<seg id="2">in the mind of its founder, Abdel-Malik Djermoune, the &quot;Parti de la Banlieue&quot; does not only target suburban residents.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;I chose a map of France as the logo,&quot; he asserts.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;When I talk about suburbs, I'm referring to all those who feel excluded from the larger national family.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Be that as it may, his project, which was presented during a press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers on Thursday, was born from a desire to better defend multiculturalism - the great cultural melting pot that, above everything else, characterises these districts.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;My primary proposal is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Abdel-Malik Djermoune, a 50-year-old regional attaché, today claims to be &quot;100% apolitical&quot;, although he has not always been neutral.</seg>
		<seg id="8">An activist supporter of Jean-Pierre Chevénement in 2002, he later supported Dominique de Villepin in the district from 2010 to 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my manifesto are associated with the Left, but if people on the Right are prepared to support me, I will listen to them too,&quot; he continues.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;It is only extremist parties that I will not talk to.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">Besides multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his manifesto - which can be read on the Internet - around various subjects intended to appeal to suburban residents, especially the young: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalisation of cannabis, lowering the voting age to 16, restoration of the function of caretaker, etc.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He still needs to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas in the political arena. &quot;It is likely that may be done just in time for the 2014 municipal elections,&quot; he acknowledges.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;The problem is time and money.</seg>
		<seg id="14">However, the 'Parti de la Banlieue' should at least be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and in other towns too I hope,&quot; he adds.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Abdel-Malik Djermoune claims there are already seven names on the candidate list in mainland France and in Martinique.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;And the mail expressing support that I have been receiving since yesterday are not all coming from the suburbs,&quot; he says with delight.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A &quot;genuineness&quot; test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The test, if adopted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market,&quot; she told the Australia India Institute today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the &quot;genuineness&quot; criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about &quot;whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A federal appeal court in Texas has reintroduced certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy, which had been blocked by a trial judge this week.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The decision means that a legal text adopted in the state in July generally challenging the right to abortion will be able to come into force.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The decision by the court of appeal means that doctors who practise abortion will need to have an &quot;admitting privilege&quot; with local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">An admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre to carry out a diagnosis or a procedure, based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Defenders of abortion stress that the content of the law may lead to the immediate closure of a third of clinics in the state, as these clinics have failed to obtain the admitting privilege for their practitioners.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In all, nearly 22,000 women will be deprived of access to such establishments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">On Monday, the day before the law was due to come into force, a trial judge considered that the provisions pertaining to admitting privileges were unconstitutional.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But the Attorney General for Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is canvassing for the role of governor, asked the court of appeal to overturn the judgement from the trial court blocking the application of the law.</seg>

		<seg id="1">At first, I was in denial about his death. I spoke of him in the present tense.</seg>
		<seg id="2">I was afraid of forgetting him, or perhaps I did not know how I was going to continue to &quot;spend time&quot; with him.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no formula, no method for passing through the wall of the invisible to be with your loved ones.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Then signs started to appear.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The first time I had this very strong feeling of his presence, he was in the passenger seat while I was driving.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another time is when I quietly woke up in the middle of the night and went to look at his watch, which I always have with me, lying on the bedside table.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The smiling image of my father stays with me during my everyday activities.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Our mother left us after an exhausting fight against cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At least, that is what I thought when I saw the shell of her stiff body under the crumpled sheets of the hospital bed.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Similarly, her funeral was a cold goodbye focused on the dim light of the candles surrounding her coffin.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I thought she had gone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Gradually, by way of tiny and slightly faint or faded appearances during the day and night, she soon came back into my life, evolving as she took back her place in the landscape of my mind which thought it was still in mourning.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And then she revealed herself by showing me aspects of myself I had never seen before, that were hidden by my relationship with her.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Thus, I learnt and understood that I had not lost my mother herself at all, just a woman that I did not know very well, a woman who embodied her during her stay on this earth.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In dying, this woman had completed her life and freed the person that I loved, and now she was back, whole and complete.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This detour in the path of my life is still the most unexpected and beautiful thing.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is a privilege to know that the people we love never leave us.</seg>
		<seg id="18">I am like my father, &quot;inside and out&quot;, it seems.</seg>

		<seg id="30">That lasted a long time, then one day he was gone.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In the end, it felt comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.</seg>
		<seg id="32">I don't know who it was that said that those who die are not forgotten but invisible.</seg>
		<seg id="33">My parents are no longer here but I feel them close to me constantly.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In every event, every moment of my life, I feel their presence, and I am always referring to them: what would they say, what would they think, what would they do?</seg>
		<seg id="35">I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night, but several times a week for sure.</seg>
		<seg id="36">I often dream of the last moments I shared with them before it was too late, except that there is still one thing that prevents me from enjoying the moment.</seg>
		<seg id="37">I often wake up distressed because it hits me and I feel their absence deeply.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Sometimes, some dreams affect me differently and make an impression on my mind, so, in effect, they continue to live and be a part of my life.</seg>
		<seg id="39">On the day before my ultrasound, when I was going to find out the gender of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up and hauled myself out of bed, and my father was waiting for me on the landing. He was smiling at me and was happy that I was expecting a little boy.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The following day, I had the feeling that he had come to visit me in my dream to tell me that he was sharing the joy I was feeling.</seg>
		<seg id="41">And, yes, I was indeed carrying a boy.</seg>
		<seg id="42">I loved sharing that moment with him and enjoy talking of that shared memory that happened after his death.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="44">One year previously, she had travelled with my family to Cuba.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Hence the shock that her loss provoked in the young graduate I was then.</seg>
		<seg id="46">In spite of everything, I said my goodbyes fairly quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="47">But she continues to influence my life, particularly in when I'm going through hard times, or when I have to make an important decision.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Deciding to learn Arabic and pursuing an interest in the Middle East, to the point of doing a Masters at a major university, in hindsight, were not trivial decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Actually, I often used to listen to her speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Morocco where she had lived for decades before coming back to France when it became independent.</seg>
		<seg id="50">The values she instilled in me are still there, so I often end up wondering what she would want me to do at a given moment.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It's the same with my opinions: I try to live up to the generosity and correctness of her mind as a fervent believer.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Nowadays I feel her as a daily presence, a benevolent force, a saving spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="53">I see her eyes resting on me.</seg>
		<seg id="54">My mother died nineteen years ago now.</seg>
		<seg id="55">She died after talking to me on the telephone.</seg>
		<seg id="56">I went through all the stages: incomprehension, anger, grief, tears that would come on their own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, at incongruous moments.</seg>
		<seg id="57">But time eased the pain.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Now there is just the gap, the silent emptiness, the need for her to entrust me, to reassure me in the palm of her gentleness.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Yet, she is there, a silent presence, watching me.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Every morning I see her worried eyes looking at me, I see the dark rings giving her a burdened look, the wrinkles around the lips dug by cigarettes, the lines that mark the forehead on days of worry.</seg>
		<seg id="61">My mother has taken possession of my face, and every morning she looks back at me in the mirror.</seg>
		<seg id="62">And every morning, I look away.</seg>
		<seg id="63">My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43.</seg>
		<seg id="64">We always feel her protecting us, nothing bad will happen to us.</seg>
		<seg id="65">This was her promise on her death bed; so, gradually, we learnt to smile again, and saying her name is no longer taboo but a comfort.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Of course, I talk to her at the dead of night when the absence hurts too much, and she comes into my dreams when my spirits are a little low.</seg>
		<seg id="67">We feel supported and protected in difficult moments, and the passage of time has made us realise that she was the conductor, with us trying to stay on the path she had drawn for us.</seg>
		<seg id="68">If somebody truly loved you, their absence cannot tear them out your heart or your memories.</seg>
		<seg id="69">In a way, the person you loved becomes your inner energy.</seg>
		<seg id="70">I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to asbestos-related cancer.</seg>
		<seg id="71">I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he would have thought or would have appreciated.</seg>
		<seg id="72">I was unable to attend his burial, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Sometimes my beliefs are different from his, so I am always asking myself if what I am doing conforms with his way of seeing things.</seg>
		<seg id="74">I have even had problems at work because of these convictions.</seg>
		<seg id="75">However, I can't do otherwise; I lose sleep and constantly ask myself what he would think.</seg>
		<seg id="76">I don't know if I have adopted his way of thinking or if I am simply like him - is it genetic?</seg>
		<seg id="77">Whatever the case, he will always be my point of reference.</seg>
		<seg id="78">He was a bit like an alter ego, we didn't even need to speak.</seg>
		<seg id="79">In short, he is there every day.</seg>
		<seg id="80">I feel his presence and it makes me happy.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Almost thirty years ago, my husband died aged 33.</seg>
		<seg id="82">I was 28 and our son was 6.</seg>
		<seg id="83">The immense pain that engulfed me has eased of course, but he is still close to me.</seg>
		<seg id="84">He very often &quot;turns up&quot; in my dreams, in a very specific way, so vivid that when I wake up I am sad again when I realise that it was just a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="85">The other night, he asked me how I was; I said not good, and he said &quot;I'm coming down&quot;, but in a voice so real that I woke up with a start, upset, and I switched on the bedside lamp and looked around, convinced that he would come.</seg>
		<seg id="86">I still live in the same house and, frequently, I feel he is watching me; I turn round and see he isn't there, but I know it's him and I talk to him.</seg>
		<seg id="87">I feel his presence in every room and it makes me happy.</seg>
		<seg id="88">I wouldn't leave this house for anything in the world. We were happy here and his spirit lives here with me.</seg>
		<seg id="89">I'm 58 and I have always lived alone since losing him. He is and will remain the love of my life.</seg>
		<seg id="90">I should say that I am rather sociable and have a job with responsibilities. I laugh and sing, I go out, I'm a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him. I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on the evening of 31 October 2013 during a violent clash on the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped working on Friday 1 November, following exhaustion of its fuel reserve, the Energy Authority for the Palestinian enclave announced.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A local commander of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another officer of the armed wing of Hamas, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell during an incursion by the Israeli army east of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Two other local officers of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Their bodies were discovered later.</seg>
		<seg id="6">According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Attack on tunnel dug by Palestinians</seg>
		<seg id="8">According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion a hundred metres or so into the territory before retreating.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In a statement, a Hamas spokesperson, Sami Abou Zouhri, paid tribute to the four &quot;heroes&quot; and stated that Israeli soldiers had died in the confrontation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Hamas praised the &quot;Al-Qassam heroes who died defending the territory against an incursion at Khan Younes by the Zionist occupier.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Many enemies were killed or injured during the operation.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Hamas guarantees that Gaza will be hell for the occupier,&quot; the spokesperson threatened.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Israeli army, on the other hand, stated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, which was discovered on 7 October and, according to the army, was intended for &quot;terrorist activities&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Hamas has defended its use of tunnels in the fight against Israel, stating that the aim was to capture Israeli soldiers so they could be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military statement.</seg>
		<seg id="17">During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the &quot;Tsahal forces&quot; (the Israeli army) and injured five soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Israeli attack in northern Syria</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;This mission was essential because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians,&quot; said army spokesperson, Peter Lerner.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Furthermore, Israel attacked a military airbase in the northwest of Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday 31 October.</seg>
		<seg id="21">A US official confirmed that there had been an &quot;Israeli strike&quot;, but did not give details of the target.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;In the past, the targets have been missiles being transferred to Hezbollah,&quot; he merely added.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information relating to the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Citing &quot;exclusive sources&quot; that it did not name, the Saudi-owned channel stated that &quot;the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-to-air missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon,&quot; referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that is fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions being heard at dawn on Wednesday in a defence airbase at Sonar Jable, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian coast.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pitcairn Island is aiming to create the largest marine reserve in the world, daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, following up on news from Radio Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The island, which lies to the east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The territory measures 47km2, including three other small islands nearby.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It has been British since its occupation by the Bounty mutineers, an episode in British maritime history that has been turned into three Hollywood films.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Several dozen inhabitants, the majority of them descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live on Pitcairn, with 95% of their income depending on the generosity of London.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The island's Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the tiny archipelago. It will be 836,000km2, corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.</seg>
		<seg id="7">An assistant to the mayor went to London to ask Great Britain to endorse this request.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected zone would be the first step towards greater financial autonomy for the island.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The project will need to be ratified by the British governor of Pitcairn, who is based in New Zealand, and the British government.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Creating such a reserve would permit the United Kingdom to protect the 836,000km2, provided it has the means to ensure it is policed - which it does not.</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is no airport on Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircrafts there to monitor the zone, and there is no port where military surveillance crafts can be placed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">France, on her part, already has to carry out the highly expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of 5 million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, adjacent to Pitcairn.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;They absolutely think their son was murdered,&quot; Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="5">They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,&quot; Crump said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="9">U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.</seg>
		<seg id="10">What was the cause of death?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Was his death the result of a crime?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I will follow the facts wherever they lead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">My objective is to discovery the truth.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists&quot; for a formal investigation, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of &quot;positional asphyxia.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Heinrich Muller, who was never found after disappearing at the end of the Second World War, was actually buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, confirmed to Bild.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Muller did not survive the war.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;His body was buried in a common grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin Mitte in 1945,&quot; he confirmed in the popular daily newspaper, basing his statement on archives.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This revelation comes 68 years after the fall of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime and solves one of the big post-War mysteries.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The German Secret Service, the BND, declared in summer 1949 that Muller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But the secret services were completely wrong.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Muller's body was found in August 1945 by a commando in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich,&quot; says Mr. Tuchel.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He was wearing &quot;a general's uniform&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;His service papers and photo, amongst other things, were found in the inside left pocket,&quot; he continued.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Bild also published a document from the borough hall of the Mitte district in Berlin, indicating that he had been buried in the district's Jewish cemetery.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Finding that one of the most brutal Nazi sadists was buried in a Jewish cemetery is an abhorrent enormity, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;The memory of the victims is being trampled underfoot in the worst manner,&quot; he said disgustedly in the paper.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Heinrich Muller was one of the major figures in the Third Reich never to be captured.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He took part in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, where the &quot;final solution&quot; was decided upon, and notably was in command of Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for the &quot;logistics&quot; of the extermination of the Jews and who was sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="2">ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; as he took the oath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic &quot;spare tyre,&quot; his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance.</seg>
		<seg id="14">His arrival was greeted with chants of, &quot;The army and the people are one hand,&quot; from the hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture room.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military's will in an indication that the contest for power will continue.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake</seg>
		<seg id="1">A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.</seg>
		<seg id="5">How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; jet designs.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing says its revamped &quot;777X&quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled &quot;Would You Accept This?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened &quot;jet set&quot; was narrower.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful,&quot; said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,&quot; said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.</seg>
		<seg id="33">While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Musicals, the Great Performances</seg>
		<seg id="1">Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or in French, song and dance productions are starting to take off.</seg>
		<seg id="2">After Broadway and London, Paris is finally finding its voice.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It's a revolution: the French musical is establishing itself as a successful genre.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For a long time, the majority of attempts, from 'Notre-Dame de Paris' to 'Mozart, l'Opéra Rock', have been embroiled in ridicule.</seg>
		<seg id="5">And successful acts such as 'Cabaret' or 'Les Misérables' have had an air of mystery about them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment at the Mogador has changed all that.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today, these two stages are churning out performances like hits.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The former is reprising its excellent 'My Fair Lady' this Christmas and has announced the worldwide production of 'Un Américain à Paris' as a follow-up.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At the Mogador, 'La Belle et la Bête' could well be one of the successes of the season.</seg>
		<seg id="10">On other stages, musicals such as '1789: les Amants de la Bastille' and small productions such as 'Disco' or 'Life and Times' are falling in step with the success and quality recorded so far.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book 'Histoires de comédies musicales' and speaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the hard-won success.</seg>
		<seg id="12">How are French musicals evolving?</seg>
		<seg id="13">The choice is growing.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Firstly there are the &quot;musical shows&quot; that evolve according to the will of the producers...</seg>
		<seg id="15">Some use lovely projections of images and a true story, such as '1789: les Amants de la Bastille'.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Others leap backwards fifteen years, under the pretext that you can put on pretty much whatever you want when you have Matt Pokora heading the bill.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Then there are the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet, which allow us to bring the golden age of Broadway back to life and rediscover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest composer alive.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Stage Entertainment popularizes variety English musicals by adapting them into French.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But projects under way such as 'Rent', 'Le Baiser de la Femme Araignée' or 'L'Éveil du Printemps' are having trouble finding finances.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Do we have enough artists capable of singing, acting and dancing, as on Broadway?</seg>
		<seg id="22">In Paris, when there are eight musicals in a season, then it's a good year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">We have 200 talented artists who move from project to project.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In the United States, the cradle of the musical, it is very different.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Young actors are trained in these skills in numerous schools.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are numerous jobs in regional theatres, touring companies, Broadway, off Broadway etc.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The breeding ground for talent is as sizable as the number of roles available.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Why are provincial tours so successful?</seg>
		<seg id="29">With the exception of opera, the provinces remain the poor relative of culture in France.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Few theatrical productions go on tour and most of them are usually &quot;boulevard theatre&quot;, intended for adults, not adolescents.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Musicals fill that gap.</seg>
		<seg id="32">These are the same young people that love reality television and the ephemeral stars it produces...</seg>
		<seg id="33">Offering good-looking (often talented) young men a leading role in a musical guarantees the adoration of young girls and often their entire family.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Facebook pages for these shows are skillfully managed by professionals who answer questions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The shows are eagerly expected by the time they reach a provincial Zénith (theatre).</seg>
		<seg id="36">The musicals are prepared in Paris and enjoyed in the provinces.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The show is designed to be staged in any major theatre in France in the same format as in Paris.</seg>

		<seg id="1">One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club,&quot; Hirsch said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as &quot;Stand Up for Heroes,&quot; an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.</seg>
		<seg id="7">As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed &quot;The League&quot;) and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation,&quot; though she is best known for her viral video series &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>
		<seg id="14">From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work,&quot; Steinberg said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.</seg>

		<seg id="1">One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.</seg>
		<seg id="2">US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says</seg>
		<seg id="1">Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country's north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country's civil war nearly three years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came one day ahead of the Nov.</seg>
		<seg id="4">1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or &quot;render inoperable&quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.</seg>
		<seg id="12">On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It has not updated that figure since.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Assad's troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was &quot;now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">It added that, &quot;no further inspection activities are currently planned.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.</seg>
		<seg id="23">They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, &quot;abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;I salute the fortitude and courage you've all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,&quot; the watchdog's director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In other developments, the Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The cause of the blast was not known, he said.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears</seg>
		<seg id="1">Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had &quot;never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation,&quot; the Commission was told.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He conceded the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming &quot;there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management &quot;from myself down&quot; failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was jailed for a minimum of six years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord &quot;very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident&quot; was &quot;not about reporting&quot; by staff, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly executed.</seg>
		<seg id="18">YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The hearing adjourned until December 20.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Père Lachaise crematorium is organizing a lay ceremony at 11am in memory of all those cremated at the establishment this year.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for Paris mayorship, is expected to attend and will later explain her proposals on funerary matters at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Click above to watch the ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="4">More and more French people are choosing cremation for their own funerals rather than inhumation - 53% against 47%, according to an Ipsos survey carried out on September 6 and 7 among 1,009 people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It is the opposite for the funeral of a loved one - the French prefer inhumation (53% against 47%).</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only 15% of those who lose a child choose cremation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In his book, La Mort en Cendres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-chairperson of the Comité National d'Ethique du Funéraire emphasises the &quot;violence&quot; that cremation represents for those left behind.</seg>
		<seg id="8">With cremation, there is a sense of &quot;violence committed against the body of a loved one&quot;, which will be &quot;reduced to a pile of ashes&quot; in a very short time instead of after a process of decomposition that &quot;would accompany the stages of grief&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There is also a &quot;symbolic violence&quot; that relates to the &quot;obliteration of the person's singularity and of distinctive symbols&quot;, which are reduced to the &quot;anonymity&quot; of ashes.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why is this accepted without difficulty in certain Nordic and protestant countries, but is still taken badly in France?</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Because cremation is a recent development,&quot; says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Thanatological Society and author of the book Apprivoiser la Mort.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Catholic Church only started tolerating it in 1963, a fact that has restricted efforts at getting to grips with it.</seg>
		<seg id="13">For François Michaud-Nérard, director general of Funerary Services for the City of Paris, getting to grips with cremation is about giving the deceased a ceremony as dignified as it would have been with an inhumation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The annual Ipsos survey shows the strength of attachment to the arrangement of the ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="15">77% of French want one for their loved ones, be it religious (53%) or civil (24%).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nowadays, 73% of people choosing cremation want a ceremony to be arranged.</seg>
		<seg id="17">66% of atheists or non-believers also want one.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Crematoria have adapted to this change in society.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;For a decade or so, they have been trying hard to spare families from the feeling of violence in waiting for an hour and a half, doing nothing, followed immediately by their being handed the ashes,&quot; observes Michaud-Nérard.</seg>
		<seg id="20">70% of establishments now offer a master of ceremonies to conduct the following ritual in the presence of the body: greet the congregation, mention the deceased by name, connect the deceased to those present, evoke who the person was, give sense to their death, organise a farewell.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This is what has been happening at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The masters of ceremonies are often people who have moved into this new type of employment.</seg>
		<seg id="23">There are also former Catholic priests.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is in this context that, since 2010, the Père Lachaise crematorium has been organising a number of memorial ceremonies, lay and non-religious, on All Saints Day, to which it invites the families of all those who have been cremated during the course of the year.</seg>
		<seg id="25">For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies has been relayed online, for those could not attend.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The crematorium has authorised us to broadcast it.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Since the Federal government recognised same-sex marriage, &quot;all spouses of military officers have a right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and to the associated benefits,&quot; said the Secretary of Defense in New York, in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League for the fight against anti-Semitism.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;However, some states have refused to issue these cards to same sex spouses in facilities of the National Guard&quot; set up in their region, he criticised, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Without these cards, such individuals cannot take advantage of numerous social or healthcare services in these bases, or access the shops of the latter.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that federal law was implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The refusal by the nine states started with Texas, which refused to implement these measures in Texan National Guard facilities due to a conflict between Texan law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, followed in refusal, according to a senior Defense official.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Pentagon estimates that the population concerned by the recognition of same-sex marriage involves about 5,600 active individuals, or 17,000 if the National Guard, the reserve and retired people are included.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million barrels last week.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Over five weeks, supplies have risen by more than 25 million barrels.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an uptick in activity.</seg>

		<seg id="0">It's a comeback in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who is staging &quot;A Danse Danse&quot;, her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the ink drawings and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos of Gymnopédies de Satie.</seg>
		<seg id="1">This is an evening that showcases Chouinard's entire spectrum, from art to mannerisms and from the blackness of ink to whiteness.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The background is a white screen.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the carpet, which is also white, in the immense space of the Théâtre Maisonneuve, a body appears, in profile, as thin as a line and dressed in black.</seg>
		<seg id="4">An Henri Michaux ink drawing is projected onto the screen.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The body, a simple stroke, takes its shape.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And this shape is definitive of the entire piece: it is a series of physical representations of drawings.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The dancers, all dressed in black, with only their hands and faces uncovered, wait on each side of the stage; they hurry on when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, then run off again.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This Henri Michaux play with black and white is performed as a series of solos, in a group in unison (a mass acting as a solo), a large group of twelve solos, in which each individual makes a representation of their own sign.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is reminiscent of &quot;Gloire du matin&quot;, wherein, in the form of solos, Chouinard delivers a series of choreographic tasks drawn on cartels and lined up at the front of the stage.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is the same principle in a giant PowerPoint version.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In this performance, the music is loud,accompanied by percussion and electric guitars.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The energy is great, and the rhythm fast.</seg>
		<seg id="13">There is a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, microphone in hand, to deliver, with no sobriety or reserve, part of a Michaux poem, in the flat monotonous voice of an auction, then continues to dance.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The music starts again, and the sequence continues.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This sustained (if that is possible) discharge of sound and energy ends up being deafening and numbing,</seg>
		<seg id="16">as does the regularity of the visual rhythm.</seg>
		<seg id="17">There are several beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been one of Chouinard's strong points - like the hair that is ruffled or the black fabric that extends the lines.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But the choreographic approach lacks composition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">One gets the impression that, instead of going in search of Michaux's work, the choreographer has imposed herself on it with using her mannerisms.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The result is bodies that seem flat in front of the drawings.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The Michaux inks, like Gestalt shapes, provide a level of imagination broader and richer than dance, more porous.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Only at the end, which is in negative, with the dancers broken up a strobe lights and becoming white symbols in a suddenly dark theatre, does it touch on magic.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The audience liked it, the reception was warm.</seg>
		<seg id="24">After the interval, the Gymnopédies is richer.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabric, like furniture in an abandoned house.</seg>
		<seg id="26">At the piano, dancers take turns to play the scores.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Their touching musical awkwardness shows real fragility.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Couples cross the stage as pairs of lovers, very sensual, even erotic.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Group work, small transiting solos, moving as a group, a chorus, makes the depiction less binary.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Clowns appear, another regular feature of Chouinard's work, wearing red noses, in very polarised parades of male/female lovers.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Their loves are toothy, evasive or playful.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The body movements, the laughter, the small cries beautifully translate the archaicness, the gracefulness and the absurdity of bodies in coitus, of beings melting into each other.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But the piece really takes off after the bow.</seg>
		<seg id="34">A clown comes back on stage as the audience is leaving.</seg>
		<seg id="35">At that point, anything goes: the fourth wall comes down, the explored universes are superimposed, the dancers ham it up, come down among the spectators, talk, smoke, pass through, play with the etiquette of applause, build up the hype amid a consciously calculated disorder that remains sensual.</seg>
		<seg id="36">They exude joy and madness, and that is Chouinard's art; contaminating the audience.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton</seg>
		<seg id="1">President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted &quot;extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011&quot; to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Double Down&quot; claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal rapport,&quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't &quot;materially improve Obama's odds.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley told the paper.</seg>
		<seg id="10">You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, &quot;Holy Christ, what do we do?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">While Daley characterized the research as &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something,&quot; Martin said on AC360.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">While Daley said he doesn't think the President &quot;was aware&quot; of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's &quot;possible&quot; Obama knew.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Possibly,&quot; Martin replied.</seg>

		<seg id="0">David Bowie: Four Unpublished Songs Released</seg>
		<seg id="1">The British musician is full of surprises this year.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Following The Next Day, released in January, he has put together a deluxe re-release planned for November 04, featuring several unpublished tracks.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Four have already appeared on the Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The announcement that David Bowie was releasing a new album had stunned the world.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On 08 January 2013, the date of his 66th birthday, he announced that a new album would be released in March.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After ten years of silence (his last record, Reality, was released in 2003) and very few public appearances, the British musician proved that he could still light up the pop scene.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A feast for fans</seg>
		<seg id="8">Not tired of making surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick up his sleeves with The Next Day:</seg>
		<seg id="9">the Thin White Duke was also planning to re-release the album on November 04.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He put together a real feast for his fans to mark the occasion.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This re-release, titled The Next Day Extra, was presented in the form of three disks: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, plus a DVD containing the four clips that have already been unveiled.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Next Day Extra had a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three songs from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, and two remixes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Moreover, David Bowie has introduced this fine box-set through a video.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In it, he presents each of the disks plus the accessories provided with them: exclusive photos and sleeves, a notebook for sharing your own impressions, a booklet of lyrics etc.</seg>
		<seg id="15">And finally, he gives a teaser to his new track, Atomica, which is typically in the style of The Next Day, with very prominent guitars and skillfully controlled rock electrics.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Previously Unpublished Tracks Released</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, Atomica is not the only track to have been released.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Informer, Like A Rocket Man and Born In A UFO are also available on the net.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The Informer is double-edged - an unsettling intro followed by a brilliant rush of sound that progressively slows down to make way for a pop ballad.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Was Bowie trying to make a reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity, in his Like A Rocket Man?</seg>
		<seg id="21">Either way, with this cheerful track, the singer seems to be in his element when his feet are no longer on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Space Oddity, by comparison, was much more solemn.</seg>
		<seg id="23">On Born in a UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: could he have come from another planet?</seg>
		<seg id="24">The spellbinding guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In any case, Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon in these tracks: in turn, an informer, a rocket man, possibly a Martian...</seg>
		<seg id="26">He veils and reveals at the same time, and likes to take on different personalities, as he has throughout his career, most notably with his personas: Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It is therefore not surprising that he should be holding a mask in the promotional photography for L'Invitation au Voyage, by Louis Vuitton, of which he is the new face.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He appears in one of their adverts, broadcast from November 10.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Cogeco Cable subscribers may soon have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and, ultimately, the Netflix video-on-demand service through their television in a seemingly not too distant future.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Cogeco subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and larger numbers of options,&quot; explained the president and CEO of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Cogeco Cable is thus following in the path of its competitors, like Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a precise launching date for this new platform.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail,&quot; emphasized Audet.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The ultimate goal is still to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it might offer Netflix if certain technical details (which it did not cite) could be sorted out.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the United States, the popular video service is said to be discussing the possibility of making its service available via their broadcasting platforms with some major cable companies.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech from the Throne on October 16.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the option of accessing the services on a pay-per-view basis.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;We have been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to purchase major packages of channels doesn't work,&quot; stated Audet.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Nevertheless, he hopes that the consultations carried out by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will give rise to interesting recommendations.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;These discussions need to produce a new type of reference framework for the definition of the new cultural policy in Canada relating to television,&quot; said Cogeco's CEO.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week, and these will be continued with the industry next spring.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In terms of results, Cogeco has said it has recorded a net profit of CAD 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, representing 82¢ per share.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This is a drop compared to the net profit of CAD 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, recorded in the same period last year.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The Montreal-based company says this drop is due to depreciation expenses relating to recent acquisitions.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In 2012 Cogeco bought US-based cable distributor, Atlantic Broadband, for CAD 1,360 million.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This was the company's first major acquisition after its failed aquisition attempt in Portugal.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet services provider based in Vancouver, for CAD 526 million last December.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In terms of revenue, Cogeco saw growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter, reaching CAD 504.7 million.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Its revenue stands at CAD 1,800 million for the current financial year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The net profit of its principal subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was CAD 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from CAD 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, for the same period last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Nevertheless, Cogeco Cable saw a 45% growth, reaching CAD 470.4 million.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Even so, the number of Cogeco Cable customers rose by 5,546 for the 2013 fiscal year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Audet is not concerned by this fluctuation in the company's number of customers.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;For me, this does not indicate a change in trend,&quot; he noted.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;It varies from one quarter to the next in the face of very lively competition.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe,&quot; Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent.</seg>
		<seg id="4">South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia's export routes through Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot;forever.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year's end.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a &quot;meaningful change&quot; that brings powers back to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels&quot; regulatory approach.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;Behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) based in central and western Asia,&quot; declared the head of the Chinese security services to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted online on Thursday evening.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Policy Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) made the statement in Tashkent while on an official visit to Uzbekistan.</seg>

		<seg id="4">According to Chinese police, three members of one Uighur family from the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, which shares borders with a number of central Asian countries, drove a car loaded with cans of petrol against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The driver of the vehicle, his wife and his mother all died in the fire in the car.</seg>
		<seg id="6">ETIM, which is fighting for independence for East Turkestan - the former name of Chinese Xinjiang - was classified by the UNO in 2002 as one of the organisations affiliated with Al-Qaida.</seg>

		<seg id="4">A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.</seg>
		<seg id="9">A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Ukraine Close to Economic Collapse</seg>
		<seg id="1">Rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor's, reduced Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, casting a doubt on the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for a year, to meet its financial obligations.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The government debt rating moved to B-, further down into the category of speculative investments.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This rating is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&amp;P seeing at least one chance in three that it will downgrade the rating again in the next year.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;It is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy will make it possible to sufficiently guarantee foreign currencies to meet its increased external financial commitments,&quot; explained the American agency.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013, and the trend is expected to continue.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This complicates the repayment of credit from abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="7">These reserves, which the authorities have had to use extensively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, are collapsing, leading to the agency considering devaluation more and more likely, which would inflate the country's foreign debt.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Moreover, Kiev needs liquid assets to pay for its gas imports from Russia, which accuses it of not having paid a bill of 882 million dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The announcement comes as bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of serious tension with its Russian neighbour, which is furious with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarterly drop between July and September.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Its debt, which is still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years. S&amp;P estimates it as 33.5% of the GDP, as opposed to 10% prior to the crisis of 2008-2009.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Experiencing a budgetary deficit, the country has been asking for aid from the International Monetary Fund for months. The latter, in 2010, had given the former a 15,300 million dollars loan, but this time it has released just 3,400 million.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The IMF is refusing to pay any further installments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, especially by increasing the price of gas for the population.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Following a fruitless mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that &quot;the significant need for external finance&quot; represented &quot;a weakness&quot;, even though there were &quot;signs of economic improvement&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">However, for the economist, Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, &quot;no improvement can be expected in the short term&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;There is little hope of unpopular reforms being made in a pre-election year,&quot; said the expert in an AFP interview. Presidential elections are planned for 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The only hope is for an improvement in international circumstances.</seg>
		<seg id="18">S&amp;P notes, furthermore, the &quot;uncertainty&quot; linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which for Brussels is conditional on the release of opposition leader Yulia Timochenko.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;Signing the agreement would be good for business in the long term, but it might have negative consequences in the short term in relation to Russia's reaction,&quot; explained S&amp;P, which is concerned Moscow may introduce &quot;trade restrictions&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Russia, which is responsible for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a free trade area is created between the EU and Kiev, it will have to reinforce its border controls for imported goods.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch</seg>
		<seg id="1">At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters&quot; school fees.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there,&quot; Mrs Amirthalinga says.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks&quot; creditworthiness.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can,&quot; says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People are saying &quot;the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's executive director.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt,&quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="24">There's an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see customers from all walks of life.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs,&quot; says Ms Yeah.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough</seg>
		<seg id="2">The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed</seg>
		<seg id="3">Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court</seg>
		<seg id="4">A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The solicitor, who was nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; and hailed by criminals as a &quot;top brief,&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Inquiries revealed Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would be exposed</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The court heard Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot;legal privilege.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: &quot;If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.</seg>
		<seg id="29">He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and put you before the courts.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Difficult Year for Pharmacists</seg>
		<seg id="1">The departure of almost 10 pharmacists from the Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) in Laval has caused turmoil amidst the managers of the Cité-de-la-Santé hospital in the year 2012-2013.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The pharmacy department has been left seriously short-staffed following multiple departures due to retirement, maternity leave or, simply, resignations.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is a staff shortage of almost 30%, making the financial year &quot;very difficult&quot; according to department head, Gillian Beaudet.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Even so, the CSSS has decided not to employ independent labour, which could be up to three times more expensive than taking on a full-time pharmacist.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We didn't resort to a stop-gap solution,&quot; explained Beaudet.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We consolidated or reduced some of our activities within the institution to get around while waiting for things to fall back in place.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We clearly worked hard on trying to persuade our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.</seg>
		<seg id="8">A combination of circumstances put us in a difficult situation last year.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">Improved situation</seg>
		<seg id="10">After this difficult period, 2013-2014 looks like a definitely easier one for the pharmacy department at the CSSS.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Three pharmacists have already returned to work after maternity leave and three others have been taken on in recent months.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In addition, the efforts made by the department to hold on to staff have paid off, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to stay on at the CSSS.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Things are going much better now,&quot; stressed the pharmacist.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three back from maternity leave.</seg>
		<seg id="15">So that will fill the gaps we had last year.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">Need still growing</seg>

		<seg id="1">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He could be released within 15 years if granted parole.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the &quot;Demolition Man&quot; for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;He should be put in front of the firing squad,&quot; Ms Corteen told AAP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and &quot;died&quot; three times while on life support.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anybody.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.</seg>
		<seg id="18">To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it's not much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;He didn't give himself up,&quot; Ms Corteen said.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until just recently, he really didn't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;There will be a lot of tears this year,&quot; Ms Corteen said.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Patek may yet appeal his sentence.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Row Over Closure of Emergency Unit at Hôtel-Dieu</seg>
		<seg id="1">In light of the rebellion that has been running for several months involving a section of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to &quot;put back the schedule for implementing the project and, in particular, the date for closing the emergency unit which cannot take place on November 4&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This was an official request made so as &quot;not to run any risks when dealing with emergency services in Paris at the start of winter&quot;, but also aimed at avoiding to hinder the Socialist Party's campaign a few months before local elections.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Despite the minister's instructions, the closure is nevertheless expected to take effect on this date.</seg>
		<seg id="4">At the APHP, officials prefer the term &quot;transformation&quot; or &quot;change in continuity&quot; to closure.</seg>
		<seg id="5">From November 4, the units of the fire brigade, which accounted for a quarter of the 40,000 cases brought to the emergency unit of the Hôtel-Dieu each year, will all have received instructions to take their about thirty serious cases per day to the emergency units of other hospitals in Paris.</seg>
		<seg id="6">November 4 is also the day on which hospital training resumes.</seg>
		<seg id="7">At the Hôtel-Dieu, interns specialising in emergencies will make way for five general medicine interns on Monday.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The transfer of internal medicine beds is scheduled for some point during the month.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;The Hôtel-Dieu emergency service has to close as soon as possible, and for us, that's November 4,&quot; Loïc Capron, the chairperson of the medical committee (CME) at the APHP which supports the management project, says straightforwardly.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;On November 4, patients will no longer be brought by the fire brigade, there will only be people arriving by their own means,&quot; confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, chief medical officer at the new Hôtel-Dieu.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;However, we will continue accepting emergency cases,&quot; he tempers, emphasising the permanent presence of emergency medical service vehicles on site to move critical cases.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;Senior emergency doctors will remain on site,&quot; he also assures.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the decision to close the emergency service resides with the regional health agency (ARS).</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Things are moving gradually,&quot; says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom &quot;there will be no change in terms of the service offered&quot;, come November 4.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The minister has either lied to us or has been lied to,&quot; laments emergency medical officer, Gérald Kierzek.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Dismissed from his position as head of emergency services in early July for taking a stand against the reorganisation project, he defines himself as a &quot;whistle-blower&quot; in the face of a &quot;cynical&quot; decision taken by the &quot;technical medical administration body&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;They are in the process of abandoning and killing off emergency units that were reformed less than five years ago,&quot; he believes.</seg>
		<seg id="18">For him, &quot;if the other emergency services in Paris were able to absorb the surplus, there wouldn't be a problem.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">But they are regularly saturated.</seg>
		<seg id="20">For example, there is sometimes a nine hour wait at the emergency unit at Lariboisière.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The ARS stresses that thirty patients &quot;despatched&quot; to several locations does not run the risk of becoming an &quot;avalanche&quot; for the other emergency services, where human resources would have been reinforced anyway.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The ARS, like the APHP, is defending the &quot;new hospital model&quot; which started being implemented on October 7 and is expected to continue taking 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">By the end of the year, self-employed GPs are also expected to participate in the implementation of an &quot;ambulatory care service&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Where are we heading if we start asking people to self-diagnose?&quot; asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom &quot;the concept of a non-major emergency&quot; is &quot;dangerous&quot; and marks a &quot;medical step backwards&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;The same thing will happen as with level 3 maternity units.</seg>
		<seg id="26">People are not stupid, they will go wherever the best care is offered.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;If the minister does not take a step by Monday, we will take a different approach,&quot; warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency medical officer and member of the healthcare CGT.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;We will have a greater presence in the local election campaigns and we will think about putting up a list.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="29">In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a UMP councillor in Paris and MP of the 4th arrondissement, states clearly that &quot;even if the UMP in Paris supports the continuation of emergency services at Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if you look at the duties.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="30">Ann Hidalgo, the Socialist Party's candidate, repeated on Monday morning on France Inter that she was in favour of a moratorium to prevent the closure on November 4.</seg>
		<seg id="31">If it went ahead, she would register her clear disagreement, stresses Bruno Juillard, her spokesman.</seg>
		<seg id="32">&quot;Even though the reorganisation of the Hôtel-Dieu has an underlying justification, we cannot let this happen without an acceptable plan for the transfer of patients to other hospitals.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they're the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are now 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February's consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; Lombardi said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But we've not been in that situation before -- it's all completely new.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was &quot;full of surprises -- so we don't know who he'll name.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="7">Gerard Villiers, who was born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, published four SAS books every year, and said he did not know how many books he had sold since the publication of &quot;SAS à Istanbul&quot;, the first in the series, almost half a century ago in 1965.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;Probably between 120 and 150 million, if you include every country,&quot; he conjectured last March.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Avenue Foch, just a short distance from the Arc de Triomphe, with his Burmese cat on his knee and a mischievous twinkle in his eye under the white hair, he listed some of the languages the adventures of SAS had been translated into: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese and Korean.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;That's not counting the pirate publications,&quot; he added, pointing to a pile of books on the low table, between the bronze and ivory artefacts collected from the 130 countries he had surveyed for the settings of his novels.</seg>
		<seg id="11">At the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader gets a book bearing the traditional cover, featuring a photo of a young woman with an ample bosom, carrying a pistol or an assault rifle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and contract agent for the CIA (to pay the bills for repairing the family mansion), is hot on the heels of all the world's evil-doers - communists in the 70s and 80s, then jihadists since the 90s.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Each book follows the same formula: a large dose of geopolitics and the exotic, several racy sex scenes, a touch of violence and torture.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I never made any claim to being an author of great literature,&quot; explained Gerard de Villiers.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;I think of myself as a storyteller who writes to entertain people, not send them a message.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">He worked &quot;like the great pre-war reporters, in the likes of Albert Londres, who went on location and came back with proper, lengthy investigations.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">The creator of SAS said he was &quot;making a sort of geopolitical soap opera&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;I follow up my files (on Afghanistan, Syria etc) constantly before setting off,&quot; added de Villiers.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On location, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, and services staff, some of whom I have known for twenty or thirty years.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, some of his SAS novels have been premonitory: a month before an attack on a command centre of the Syrian government, in which several senior officials were killed, he had already told the story in &quot;Le Chemin de Damas&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In &quot;Les Fous de Benghazi&quot;, he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in the city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In 1980, he described the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in &quot;Le complot du Caire&quot; a year before the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In October 2012, in &quot;Panique à Bamako&quot;, he mentioned columns of 4x4s of jihadists sweeping towards the Malian capital.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;I'm no seer,&quot; Gerard de Villiers would say in his defence. &quot;I simply make conjectures based on countries that I know well and, occasionally, some of my conjectures come true.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">After travelling to - often troubled - zones, he would spend a month at his 1976 IBM daisy wheel typewriter, &quot;every part of which has been replaced&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="26">300 pages later, he would write the words &quot;The End&quot; and correct each page by hand.</seg>
		<seg id="27">On the walls of his office hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African war lords.</seg>
		<seg id="28">De Villiers was regularly criticised by feminist groups for male chauvinism and by human rights organisations for racism - accusations he would dismiss in two sentences:</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Some women in my books are sex objects, others are beautiful, intelligent, brave women.</seg>
		<seg id="30">I have always been well-received in Africa, where I have a very large number of readers.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="31">Gerard de Villiers said it himself: &quot;Like all heroes, Malko Linge is ageless.</seg>
		<seg id="32">He will not die and will not retire.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Any more than I will.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Not everyone is pleased with Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to give traffic light posts in Brussels a &quot;face-lift&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Minister of Public Works and Transports in Brussels had launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday, consisting in repainting 16 traffic light posts in the yellow and blue colours of the Brussels region.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The aim of this is to both &quot;increase safety&quot; and &quot;enhance the identity of Brussels&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The idea is to eventually repaint all the traffic lights in Brussels, at an estimated cost of one million Euros.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the blue chosen by the Minister is &quot;too dark&quot;, according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who talks of the &quot;Flemishing&quot; of the capital and is demanding the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Not content with spending Brussels residents' money like water on this scheme of giving traffic light posts a face-lift with the colours of the Brussels region, Brigitte Grouwels is continuing her efforts to turn the capital Flemish,&quot; says an angry De Bock in a press release.</seg>
		<seg id="7">After her mango yellow and black taxis, she has ended up repainting the posts in Brussels yellow, dark blue and black.</seg>
		<seg id="8">According to the MP, there is now &quot;no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The residents of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a Christian Democratic and Flemish Minister, who is carrying out the New Flemish Alliance program herself.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is high time the Flemish Trojan Horse was stopped.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Let's not forget, Brigitte Grouwels was elected by 2,245 votes, that is 0.5% of Brussels inhabitants!&quot; De Bock concludes.</seg>
