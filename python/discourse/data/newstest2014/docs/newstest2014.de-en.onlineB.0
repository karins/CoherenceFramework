Schools are encouraged to a greater focus on math, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature students have to continue at least a Shakespeare play, a novel of the 19th Century, treat romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
In the test, see also "unseen texts" input, in order to stimulate wider reading.

Other core courses be changed next year.
In a separate initiative is Ofqual, announce the supervisory authority for inspections, a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer said Education Secretary Michael Gove, that "there is broad consensus that we need to reform our checkout system to restore public confidence" one, in which he stressed the GCSEs would be "challenging, ambitious and rigorous".
Studies show that in English schools less time for mathematics is spent - 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year - as in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore will receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, but from coalition sources say the comprehensive math exam - combined with a stronger weighting of the compartment in rankings - will probably encourage schools to be recognized more hours.
The curriculum more attention is paid to "real-life problems," including financial mathematics.

Rapists in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the offender has been sentenced on Friday to two life sentences.
This was reported by the station SABC.
The victim later died of the consequences of serious injury.
John Kana beginning of the week the crime had already been found guilty.
The act had triggered nationwide terror.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological support.
Kana had admitted during the trial to have been in the Tatnacht with Booysen in a bar.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped, but he denied being responsible for the death of the girl.
The police were initially considered by several perpetrators, but dismissed two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecutor emphasized during the procedure, she was convinced that Kana was at the time of the attack alone.
Rapes are almost part of everyday life in South Africa: Every year there are about 64 000 reports of sexual violence.
That's almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with the 82 million more populous than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's organizations in South Africa estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual violence but on the 10 - to 25-fold.

This spy revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and policies by themselves, aimed at the formerly covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these lessons learned is increasingly clear, the intended purchase of the same risks were clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven to have positive, my government dissent treated still as a breach of faith and seeks to criminalize political expression and be prosecuted.
Nevertheless: Speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States will bear with the support of the international community, these adverse attitude.
I hope that I, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation is settled, will be able me to the responsible elucidation of matters relating to the investments made in the media statements, particularly with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports appropriately and legally in accordance with participate.
I look forward to talking with you in your country once the situation is resolved and thank you for their efforts to maintain international law that protects us all.

Move through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend in order to treat hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or use your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle one of the Top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to select him for the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years saw Georges Bwelle with how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and went to hospitals that do not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle in 1981 in a car accident near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, injured.
At first he only had a broken arm, but then made ​​an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma, which should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have released him from Cameroon, if we had had the money.
Instead Bwelle spent years to accompany his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get treatment there, they had to offer.
"It's not easy," commented Bwelle.
It is five clock in the morning to leave the house and run to the hospital to be first, and is not yet first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelles father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for it, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health care spending in the state are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and to see so many of his compatriots did suffer in Bwelle the decision ripe to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 free surgeries in the last year.
He was himself a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.
In addition, he established a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME traveling on weekends in rural areas and there offering free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he squeeze and up to 30 people in minibus and take the tied medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain in the villages who need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his big smile and boundless energy - is happy at this joyous celebration.
The next morning the team begins with the analysis of hundreds of patient.
"Per trip we treat 500 people," said Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates - a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply can not afford.
Evenings, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations normally find in a school, town hall or an apartment instead, after the procedure the patient get up and go into the recovery area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the generator of the group and so work Bwelle and his volunteers into the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a tough task, but the village musicians normally help to keep the team motivated.
"You drums all night to keep us awake and able to continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then travels back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group - a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has in recent years carried out 700 free surgeries and knows that she whose work has an enormous difference for the people they help.
A man explained that the free operation of a hernia, which he had received, it now enables to work again.
"It changed my family's future," said the man.
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaounde.
With this second job he Financiers 60% of its charitable activities, as Bwelle, the rest come from private donations.
"I really do not know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia and voluntarily cooperates in Bwelles group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization, so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students as O'Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience, they would never get at home.
"We can be there, where we help to dab blood or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle keep in operations," said O'Malley.
That would be in America as a medical student in the second year never possible.
The students pay for their trip to Cameroon normally even and often bring donated medical supplies with.
Are they but once in Yaoundé, Bwelle will cover accommodation, transport and guide.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle the almost constant work is not a burden.
To help others to a happier life and to fulfill a promise he made ​​to his father, gives him great pleasure.
"I'm so happy when I'm doing this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again, to relieve the pain.

Pope Francis appointed in February first Cardinals
Pope Francis going on 22 February first new cardinals of the Catholic Church appointed as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking cleric in the Catholic Church after the Pope and it is they who choose a pope, so Francis is therefore appoint the first group of men who will participate eventually in the choice of his successor.
Currently, there are 201 Cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 years will not participate in the election of a pope - the fall of a group of 120 "Cardinal electors" to.
In a statement, in which the news was announced, said Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony on the appointment of the new cardinals will be held, which is also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to give its decision on the convening of the consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world, can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinal electors would be ready by February likely declined.
He explained that a pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of cardinal electors again amounts to 120, and so many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year was important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, so Valero.
Currently, there is a certain amount of overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from around the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the company founded by St. Francis Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the job to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was "quite possible" that Francis the Cardinals for advice please.
But so far we have not been in this situation - that's all brand new.
Valero said that typically the bishops were appointed from great places to Cardinals, but put Francis' full of surprises - so we do not know who he appoints. "

Is Europe's elite willing to make with the UK shops?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who care in the UK for wealth and job, want to change our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have given under British business leaders in order and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU's largest and most comprehensive survey.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders that represent the British company sizes, sectors and regions about.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now exported outside Europe, focusing on countries that modernize and grow, while the Member States are languishing in the EU.
You want that from the government new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored, rather than on a long and tiring process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
When asked about her view on specific statutory issues - from antitrust law to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believed that the control of these key competences should be sent back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, since according to a statement the company the cost of the rules from Brussels would now outweigh the advantages of being part of Europe's trade area - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the to which are traditionally the most Europhile.
Finally, and most will probably say, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wishes of the UK a course in the direction of change of the Agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This finding, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is on a "meaningful change" urges that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
The stakes are high - an amendment to the Agreement, and better conditions for the UK would result in 16 percent to a change of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt about it: This survey shows that the UK economy stands behind his plan for the renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that firms expect a significant shift in the balance of power back to the UK from a retrial.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro zone is now moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK as the result of our survey shows, which means an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to business regulations.

Gutach: even more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B-33 pedestrian crossing is in Gutach been put into operation at the village car park - within sight of the old town hall lights.
Two plants so close together: intention or Schildbürger prank?
This question has been clearly answered yesterday Gutachs mayor.
"The town hall traffic light has been installed at that time, because this ensures the school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-traffic secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The yesterday officially commissioned system is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Church Street.
We have the museum, two churches, park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area> Grub. "
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic had to their safety another traffic light here," said Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the District Office Offenburg.
"According to recent measurements on the B 33 daily about 12 000 vehicles Gutach the community, of which about ten percent of heavy traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, is the construction of an additional traffic light more than necessary: "Safety here just before," said Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was being considered, but rejected because of the tightness in the crossover region Sulzbachweg / Church Street.
It has previously been tested according to Arnold when choosing the location of the traffic light poles all: "By means of an extra long logs loaded especially for us Transporter, we tested whether these vehicles can move out of the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without looking fold the traffic light poles."
The approximately 15 000 euros expensive traffic light system itself is the "state of the art, what it currently on the market are," said Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights are clearly visible by drivers, for example, even when the sun is low.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
Per direction of travel, there are three lighting systems.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
Does the pedestrian traffic lights the button tests the upper radar sensor, the traffic situation.
Is the road free, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrians can be terminated.
"If a group or handicapped people walk across the street, the green phase is extended, so it comes everyone safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver must think for themselves here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the green traffic light for pedestrians, rustled a luxury-class vehicle through - in bright red

Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The government is thinking in the context of advanced actions through a "test of authenticity" for foreign workers with 457 visa.
Should the test be introduced, he came across a criterion used to prevent that the 457 to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia will be used.
Today, a discussion of the government's proposal was published after the former deputy of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the comments of the Government in regard to foreign workers because they could be perceived by the neighbors of Australia as an insult.
"Loud explanations like, foreigners should get in line behind 'and' Set first Australians' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when trade unions called for a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and if some discernment in an echo of this historical artifact in the region, would not surprise me that.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once planned by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was to discuss human trafficking in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still under consideration.
If the "criterion of authenticity" is accepted, then could someone who applied for a visa to be checked as to whether "the Application in the cases is real, in which the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company or person connected . "
Companies may also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after, have finally set hundreds in the past, companies who wanted to initially support only a small number of workers.
Meanwhile, died a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The troubled nine year old son of the man who had come with him to Australia, is served since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was on the boat also.

Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween was something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, staying up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years I have declared not ready to distribute sweets from my apartment, and probably will not do it again this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year, indicating a total of 6.9 billion U.S. dollars for candy, costumes and decorations, the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing which I am every Halloween but then look again, the trend values​​.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion U.S. dollar spent, the NRF.
This year, provocative inanimate objects all the rage.
Women no longer have cases in sexy clothes, she can now also embody tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Space Men'll make it this year in the Instagram feeds.
According to Google, are the most searched costumes zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were, to my surprise not alone.
In fact, Americans spend $ 330 million this year for costumes of their pets, so the NRF.
These are a lot of "hot dogs".
As for sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans this year will be $ 1.9 billion to spend on it, according to The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of candy bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for according to the U.S. Department of Commerce 41 million people who move with the saying "Trick or Treat" by the district.
In fact, we will be buying more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - make no mistake about anything - eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume the sugar-sweet candy corn, yet 15 million kilograms thereof are sold around Halloween, the National Federation of the confectionery manufacturer.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery I could not solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it is haunted.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which by the way is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States achieve the $ 500 million proceeds, so America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos that you pee straight in the pants and make friends then on Facebook, where you they do not get rid of again, and then the type to which you are located is a comment leaves like "cute face".
But we finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin familiar, when we were kids, and carving a jack o lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - something that we have done from an early age.
Fortunately, the "Baby in Pumpkin" trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with it, zurechtzuschnitzen the pumpkin and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans spend about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, as the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern that rots slowly in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms pumpkins were harvested.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something nice out of her 921-pound pumpkin.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) has extended on Friday its investigation on whether Obeid various State Minister to the effect affects leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids two restaurants and a café operated without an invitation after their expiry in August 2005 to extend.
Now being investigated for the accusation, Tripodi knew about Obeids concealed interest in the land after Tripodis former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole had testified accordingly on Thursday.
After years of talks, which started in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the lease contracts.
The tenants were against it and also wanted to longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for the Company at Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids annual $ 2.5 million extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who until November 2009 was Minister of Ports of February 2006, had originally called for public tenders.
But he denied to have made ​​the changes at the request of Obeid, who had as Tripodi confirmed pushed for a reorganization of the lease of government regulations.
One of the ICAC submitted telephone transcript showed calls from the August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official, who had moved into the harbor Ministry, after having worked under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
"Was that discussed in these telephone conversations theme the development of commercial leasing arrangements," asked the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi said.
I can not remember what was discussed, but it definitely was not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.

NSA revelations strengthen corporate paranoia because of government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
At the direction of the Federal Agency for State Protection and Counter Terrorism (BVT), the German domestic intelligence agency, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost of less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank is located.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the U.S. and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, was once again in September that the United States did not use possibilities of foreign espionage, "to steal the secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. firms, the latter enhancing their international competitiveness and their profit could. "
But since Edward Snowden, who has become a whistleblower former employee, has started with the release of his cornucopia of U.S. surveillance secrets to European governments and business leaders are not sure if they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency, the Brazilian oil company Petrobras spying and data American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo has procured have brought the company paranoia due to government surveillance to a new high.
The final straw brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel was bugged telephone, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can become a target, then certainly also managements potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," explains Oliver Green, President of the BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. is now presented an almost as great a risk as China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey, which was published in July by the consultant EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden however, there was as yet no evidence that the U.S. has passed the secrets of foreign firms in their own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the fact that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and they should reduce their dependence on the U.S..
The companies in this regard are skeptical.
In the Bundestag was suggested we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
"It does not work," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If you had wanted a strong European IT industry, then you would not have let her die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized by the coal cars over to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, range and technical sophistication of anomalies detected by the Snowden revelations U.S. spy agencies companies have shocked, who had previously seen the largest espionage risk in China.
In cloud computing, a great change takes place because European business leaders now are more aware that in the United States are subject to the jurisdiction thereof stored data and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, survey rejected after the revelations about the U.S. data mining activities with prism about ten percent of the non-resident in the United States members plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new issue of customers who did not exist a year ago - she is: Where is my data stored and you can guarantee that they remain physically in this right room"
Many German business leaders argue that recent reports confirm just what they already knew anyway: that powerful nations want to steal their most precious secrets and this must therefore be guarded at all costs.
The fact that industrial espionage takes place, is no surprise.
That's always been that way.
"It was for many years a subject and has not fundamentally changed by the current debate," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The American spy us on a commercial and industrial level, so how do we do that too, because it is in the national interest to defend our company.
The management usually does not brag about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that gives attackers advantages.
In large companies employees has long been ingrained that take away one free USB sticks at a fair or in the unattended leaving behind a laptop in the hotel room was not advisable to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at carmaker Audi says that it belonged for years to the standard practice to collect before a board meeting, the phones so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid cell phones when they go on trips abroad, because smartphones can potentially be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium businesses remain vulnerable against hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, the staff and financial resources to effectively protect against unauthorized access trade secrets," warns the BAT in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against industrial espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post France, Russia and Israel were ranked behind China in second place of the countries in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February who used to procure economic data of hacking.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed to when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence agencies know very well that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terror, spying on its allies."

Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and all who cheered and applauded him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena, and though he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to which he serves.
Just as it is started, it will not be long until he's on the "Horse of the Year" show - and I'm sure he will do well.

Bailout over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian Healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions that are associated with the bailout over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health services to ensure that the government of the state of the money can not waste it.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth would take "immediate action" to avert a crisis that was caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system limitations.
Funding for a period of four years was decided by government consultations with the independent MPs Andrew Wilkie Tasmania.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that affects our view of the unique challenges that the state faces," Plibersek said today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for optional services.
By 2600 more operations, including orthopedic surgery and treatments for cataracts, residues should be removed.
In addition, there is money for clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up care after hospitalizations, specialist training, provide mental health and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas of which I affected hospital staff have said that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth can, and report monthly on where the extra money was spent.
A three-member commission will be set up and to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today that $ 325 million would be of little use when "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government that they had responded to its request for urgent help, which he had expressed at first against the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to use of the public health system of the state of the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state of these optional benefits are largely offset the recent cuts.
However, the health spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement was merely a "patch" solution.
"We are, therefore, in the present situation, because the laboratory state government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health care system," he told ABC TV.
It can not be that a state government nearly half a billion dollars tears from the system and the Commonwealth put into it 300 million and then pretend to be the good news.
Dutton Plibersek urged to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent for extra paperwork.

One could call him the Dostoevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and short stories also have some serial.
Amazingly, the relationship in the exterior: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky with his massive oeuvre as Ergründer and apologist of the Russian soul to understand, to read Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite a bit in their own country.
Some titles are published by Heyne Verlag, Haffmans the cassette with the 118 stories sells Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological advances, coupled with paranoia, obsession with security and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer keyboard.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He suddenly realized early on that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human from a machine, the creator of his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg inspired.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" is from the year 1956, he exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
Here, it is the principle of "pre-crime" developed "Pre-Crime", ie what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which frighteningly similar to our own, look mutants in the future - and the police to take one.
"We gather individuals who have violated no law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch us before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "In our society, there are no felons, but we have a detention camp full of Pesudoverbrecher". Read time flows.
You accept that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought is put into action.
Dick's story acts as the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the noise of the NSA wiretapping.
Anticipation of the attack: Understanding Obama's drone philosophy and practice.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The police chief complained that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls the everyday - and what is left over by the state.
Then the supervisor itself is supervised and convicted of a future crime.
The system rotates through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own requirements.
If errors and sacrifices not only purchase, but it builds up.
The system creates the danger that it fights.
Read Philip K. Dick means to repeatedly come closer to the truth.

Court decision blocked for Stop-and-Frisk policy of the NYPD
A federal appeals court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the arrangement of a judge, the changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program ( "stop and search") had called for the New York Police Department, and gave birth to the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Court of Appeals stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be exposed, was until a decision on an appeal of the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way how the program was being implemented for the arrest and questioning of persons.
The city filed an appeal against their assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to establish a monitoring body, which should assist the police in changing their policy and the related training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday to the required suspension.
The appellate report stated that the judge should be relieved from the case because they had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by it is determined that a judge should avoid even the appearance of partiality, which was partially covered with a series of media interviews and public statements founded, in which they had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled, police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted black and Latino men would take in an inappropriate manner with the Stop-and-Frisk program targeted.
They appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program with body worn cameras in neighborhoods where the majority of controls were performed.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who have been released after a check by the police.
A hearing on the appeal of the city is after the 14th March 2014 planned.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Checks of this kind have been around for decades in various forms, but increased the number of recorded inspections during the tenure of the non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all time high of 684 330 in 2011, most of them black and Latino men.
2004 action was by four men, who belonged to all minorities filed, which evolved into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police force and influence the way how other police departments the control.
Opponents are of the view that changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime, nor would money wasted and the broader problem of police not resolved, over the past decade stand after the loss of thousands of jobs under pressure.
The judge pointed out that they did not finish the Stop-and-Frisk Practice, which was constitutional, but only the method of implementation of controls by the NYPD is reforming.

Anger at sentence for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had come in 2002 in the bombing in Bali killed responded, angry about the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was put on trial, because Umar Patek should be in their view shot summarily.
Patek, who was almost ten years as one of the most wanted persons of Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bombing to a prison term of 20 years.
With parole he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of ​​Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilty verdict was also in a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 included.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if the death penalty could have asked for the man who is referred because of his reputation as a masterful bomb-maker as "Demolition Man".
The decision has painful memories awakened in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the damage done by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago desolation.
Fighting With tears she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean really, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should bring him to a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so that I will not get another grandson and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, as on 12 October 2002, a massive bomb exploded in a pickup truck shortly after 23 clock, which was parked outside the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber could detonate a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell after the attack for a month in a coma and "died" three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said, Patek have the same fate as deserved the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell - Amrozi, Imam Samudra and Mukhlas - who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To keep him alive - no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after he has killed 202 people and injured many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers, who was on trial.
He withdrew from almost a decade of arrest, but was eventually taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces nearly four months later, the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden killing.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had provided the information that Patek was in Pakistan to bin Laden to meet up with the aim to establish the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda again.
"He has not asked," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on others.
The judgment was delivered before the ten year anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.

Traffic lights on constant red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light is simply not green.
The contact loop in the road is not responding, or the light signal is faulty.
What is one to do - running a red?
If an interested party waiting at a red light long enough and the crossing is free, he can drive, says the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The waiting time must but be "appropriate", which should be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before is to start from a malfunction of the traffic lights.
Who continues the journey despite the red light, but would have to be aware that he bears full guilt for an accident caused thereby.
Those who tolerated less than five minutes, waiting may not be long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the treated case a driver had after about three minutes continuous red ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a red light violation negligent.
The traffic light was in fact not defective, but jumped a little later to green.
But not the fine - A ban was spared because of the particular situation.

Profits at Bombardier after decline in numbers and delivery orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc. said Thursday a 15 percent decrease in net income, after he was advised by a decline in aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector under pressure.
Bombardier, based in Montreal published no flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the plane could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable, next September.
On the maiden flight of test aircraft and a half months ago, so far followed only three more starts, which makes it appear doubtful whether the test phase proceeds as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts, leading to a sharp fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday its rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the fact that the stock has limited upside potential in the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker delivery numbers for aircraft were largely expected, but by the margin development in the transport sector, we are clearly disappointed," Doerksen said in a client letter.
We believe that Bombardier new orders for the CSeries is obtained when the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if in the coming months, no new orders will be announced, we expect the market against the program is more skeptical.
Bombardier hopes that the plane number of the CSeries can catapult the company into the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, the public, and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
But so far, firm orders for the CSeries 177 are moderate, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of flight tests and see if the allegations of the company in terms of fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new commercial jet aircraft are accurate.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders at the beginning of the commercialization of the jet.
The management assured on Thursday with analysts and the media also, the program lies in the schedule.
"The test aircraft is no longer remained on the ground as expected," Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that during the life of the aircraft were ground testing and software updates have been applied.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to do a first flight and then to append a revision period, what we have done.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft was expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, it was said by the companies.
However, analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the maiden flight of the first customer a CSeries aircraft can operate.
Bombardier said it will check the planning for the commissioning (EIS) and will update in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier's internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 shifts," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended 30 September fell Bombardier's net profit to $ 147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $ 172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly gradually decreased from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of $ 4.56 billion expected, Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 last year.
The net orders fell by 83 aircraft to 26
The order backlog in the air and space division was on 30 September $ 32.9 billion and was compared with 31 December unchanged.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our requirements, but the low order intake and market conditions overall were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Sales in the air and space division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, has announced that revenue has increased in this division by almost eleven per cent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transport sector was 30 September $ 32.6 billion and was compared with 31 December increased slightly.
The profit margin in the area of ​​transport was affected by processing problems in some large contracts.
According to management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon session on Thursday the Bombardier shares rose 8.5 percent gave in and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will join the management board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer Bombardier and closest rival, announced on Thursday a ten percent drop in quarterly earnings.

Rules for electronic devices on airplanes remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian airline passengers must continue off tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to relax the rules for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their rules so that passengers see on their devices during critical phases of flight e-books, watch videos or play, provided they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight passengers, this is already allowed, but find it a lot of people angry that they e-books are not read at startup and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the U.S. airlines have to do tons of work, but follow no immediate plans to change its rules.
The air traffic control authority CASA also stated that they would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia are still valid.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in aircraft," was announced.
The topic is subject to provisions allowing the airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew.
Virgin has already led to the CASA talks over a useful expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explains that one is open to change, but this would have to be initiated by the legislature.
"We would welcome a review of the authorization of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, after we offer now (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a spokesman.
Qantas stated that they would remain until further with the current regulations.
"Our current policy stipulates that electronic devices during takeoff and landing may not be used, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, of which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it exactly.
The decision affects at U.S. companies, depending on the age of the fleet varies from.
You must prove that their aircraft can tolerate interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, carry-on programs and customer training.
"When an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases, in poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers, while the landing switch off the device.
The group also recommended to safely stow heavier devices during takeoff and landing under the seat or in the compartments above the seats.

Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which the wagging tail of a dog stands with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dog with his tail wagged more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and to respond.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to take this for us in other species.
He also noted that the right brain is in dogs just like in humans responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail wagging their species, the researchers monitored the animals, while looked at these films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of quadrupeds and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moved in the times a times in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have the dogs movies with dogs shown - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw an otherwise emotionless dog moves the tail to the right (as viewed from the perspective of wagging the dog out), they remained completely relaxed.
But it was the tail inclination mainly to the left (again, from the perspective of the dog that wags), so increased their heart rate and they looked uneasy.
According to Professor Vallortigara the dogs do not communicate with each other intentionally by these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience, in which movements they should be worried and when not.
He said: "If you have several encounters with other dogs and wag his tail in one direction is rather linked with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond based on these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Bristol said that this was not the first study in which it was investigated whether the left and right is important for dogs.
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn your head to the left when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right if there is a contented dog.
In another research project at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was written: "Dogs tend to go on a robot dog, if its, tail 'wags left and not the right place to be restless - the other way around as in the Italian study."
According to his testimony, the differences could be because the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he said.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals, that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
Since their behavior but leave simply record it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes, sometimes moved to the one in the other direction.

Pawn shops booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
In a pawn shop in the shopping center in Bendemeer Singapore Janani Amir Thal Inga will exchange a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters can.
"My husband and I have just bought a house because all my money is tied up in it," says Amir Thal Inga.
Although 3,000 Singapore dollars earn every month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative assistant and her husband also work, the monthly family income was not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where the household debt increases - so large that valuemax, where she has made ​​her exchange, this week was the third pawnshop, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The mortgaging of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amir Thal Inga - but also almost as low as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically require pawn shops in Singapore an APR of 17 percent, which is only slightly above the 15.4 percent that requires the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pawn shops offer but the advantage that there is no credit checks or proof of income is required, which is why loans are faster than with banks possible.
For this reason, millions of people contact in the region at pawn shops after families are feeling the pressure of rising living costs and an increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policy in developed economies look to families with lower and middle incomes pawn shops, so as to compensate the difference in stuttering economy.
This week marked the rating agency Standard & Poor's rising household debt burden, mainly by rising mortgage as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore in the opinion of the Agency, the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent in the year 2008.
Economists worry also because of the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which is just come out this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a persistence of weak exports and a decline in consumer demand.
"In effect, this means that with the rising cost of the people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) are trying to supplement their income, wherever that is possible," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the last two years, the trend to pledge personal property exacerbated, as people take the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family in cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged goods in the 200 pawnshops in the city state gold.
People say: "The price of gold looks good, let's grandmother's pledge gold chain and bring back next month."
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, Easy Money, has experienced in its stores a 20 percent increase in customers in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that wishes to expand valuemax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 further in Singapore, not only in the neighboring Malaysia - where the company operates four houses - but also outside of Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, Executive Director of valuemax.
The Company financed the 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it occupied this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders are caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, explains Yeah, that pawn shops not only more favorable interest rates than other lenders would offer, but also not directly increased the debt.
"Customer borrow items they already own, and the liquefaction of personal property does not increase the Haushaltsverschulung," she explained.
The mortgage lending is socially increasingly accepted as a short-term secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawn shop in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore are also in the branches of valuemax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
To us, clients come from every social class.
"This includes Wealthy in the short term borrow something for a business or investment, or have small businesses that are bottlenecks in the cash flow bridge," said Yeah.
Sometimes they also need just very fast money.

From the British government, a study was announced, which will increase the benefits of HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work by HS2 Ltd is proposed to carry on at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring together the UK closer".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to be working with the British government in this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost for the construction of high-speed rail line between London and the North of England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for another route capacity and travel time improvements for the North of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less, ultimately from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network, which brings together the UK and its cities closer."
We go ahead with HS2, because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between the 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government Keith Brown Carmichael called on to "unequivocally" to work for the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time provides the economic strength of Scotland an argument for fast rail links throughout the UK."
Therefore, we are delighted to be working as a partner of the British government and to investigate the options for a high-speed rail link to Scotland, the benefits for all and creates the connection Glasgow-Edinburgh adds that plans Scottish Government already.
I look forward to examine the investigation report with the British ministers in the next year and to jointly decide on the next steps.

Even those who could not afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany, should always consider that he could also be ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language is simplistic common in Dolce Vita,' is the textbook author resettlement willing to consider.
In their models, there are classical models of care, alternative living arrangements or the often quoted Retiree WG.
At the age of each has their ticks and quirks
'For me, as a residential community would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Certainly not., As in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen
'At the age you just need his retreats', as Ries.
That a senior living community can still work, do not want to exclude the author yet.
This must then have been different but as in the classical student apartment.
And sometimes you just want to even his rest ', she believes.
With this view she is not alone, at least in the state capital.
'Most of the old people in Stuttgart want as long as possible remain in their own home', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the civil service life in old age the state capital.
Your department advises people around the theme 'Getting Older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often take inconveniences and restrictions in buying, just to stay in their familiar surroundings to be able to, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
There are now many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all who deal with the age-appropriate remodeling their house or apartment, first of all to inform themselves thoroughly and not to instruct the first best craftsmen.
Today, there are specialists for the age-based reconstruction.
Even in the apartment to let one or other implement, and if it's just the toilet seat, clears the interior designer on.
But it is not always possible to the existing dwelling age appropriate and thus remodel accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had Waltraud Ries make.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the home, which also paved the way with stairs up to the apartment door but that would be far greater obstacle.
It will continue to search until they found the ideal property for herself and her husband.
Before the move it is a horror to her more than before the spider on her apartment door.

Cocaine addict lawyer who drug lord before the police investigation warned, go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough on
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal lawyer who warned a drug lord in front of a large police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, took care of the underworld size Neil Scarborough containing sensitive information about investigations into its activities in the drug trade, after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The by criminologists as "first class" touted lawyer nicknamed "Bash" 2011 was arrested at his home after police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug method.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, handed in while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the Bar Association.
The investigation revealed that, Ditta regular Class A drugs consumed after traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards were found in tests.
Over a period of eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation for heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people were later arrested after police ensured in a number of house searches heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction would become public.
Today Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week process in two counts of obstruction of justice and sentenced.
He admitted cocaine possession in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out against Scarborough in their investigation that he had been in February 2011 in regular telephone contact with Ditta.
Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas house and there the drug with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove put under the dustbin of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough telephoned regularly with Ditta, who was at dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine notifications were exchanged between the two.
Was announced in court that Ditta was a "regular customer" of cocaine, after Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, his wallet and to his credit in tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken with the alleged dealer, because this was his client, claiming that their discussion is subject to the "attorney-client privilege."
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and he was a hair sample taken.
When police interrogation, he stated that he operate both under his home address as well as the workplace an office and clients would call him at home because of legal matters.
Was announced in court that he had called major players in the drug trade, of which he had previously represented by some significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about it.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that you're not breaking the law."
Ditta is accused of abusing its position as a trial lawyer, he has become very involved with certain clients.
The relation in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplied his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the attorney of such persons.
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He was the police investigation as far as possible meet, so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He stood too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he admitted it, that its independence has been compromised.
Ditta had any wrongdoing by himself, claiming: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it now."
But after the hearing, said Superintendent Lee Halstead by police in Lancashire: "Mr. Ditta has the step of a criminal defense lawyer to a criminal at the moment did when he began to acquire drugs by organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives leading members of organized crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Attorneys must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure the public trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had explained the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking guilty.
Thirty-five more beteiligte'Personen in drug trafficking were sentenced to cumulative sentences of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website Ditta published a range of questions and answers about yourself, in which he stated his dream job was to represent as an attorney client on death row in America, his ultimate dinner guest was Muhammad Ali and inequality was the motivation for his working.

Council takes trackage targeted
If the level crossing be "at the Hirschen" comprehensively renovated to improve road safety?
Yes, the councilors have decided.
Schiltach must for take in hand 220 000 EUR.
The German railway intends next year to improve the Kinzig Valley railway line.
Particular emphasis has been improving security at railway crossings - regularly occur nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the communities rebuilding measures, they must participate with one third of the costs, share the rest rail and bottom hem.
Schiltach city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the special features of Bahübergangs "at the Hirschen".
But then there is the city, west to build the level of the local tunnel entrance of the train tracks a bulge.
There are also larger vehicles, for example, those long timber could carry, stand in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore suggested a retaining wall required to construct such a way that the city could widen due course the subsequent road to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This has been hotly debated in the council, as some councils the need for road circulation in doubt attracted Thomas Kipp brought his statement the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take as much money because so few vehicles in the hand"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railroad crossing "deer" was being used regularly for long timber transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" will partially transported via this route, because up to 20 meter long vehicles could not use the track at the Haeberle bridge because they could not then turn into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as Umleitungfür those vehicles that can not use the tunnel when the main road is closed, argued Haas.
Since it was anticipated that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel would have to be rebuilt and restored, as is currently the case in Wolfach, could play an important traffic importance also for a longer period the railroad crossing "on" deer ".
The councils agreed to be examined, which costs would cause the angedachte widening of the road.
Notwithstanding this was the reconstruction of the railway crossing majority agreed with the proviso that the required retaining wall is built so that the city's subsequent direction of "Bahnhofstrasse" could, where appropriate, expand for oncoming traffic to around 5.5 meters.
The reconstruction of the railroad crossing at the tannery Trautwein could, however, draw a very different problem by itself, which affects the access to the rapidly rising "Geroltzhäuser way."
The administration had let examine the reconstruction plans of the railway by the engineering firm Breinlinger because they had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser path is still easily possible.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it is not inconceivable that the slope ratios of the road could lead to longer vehicles sit.
The responsibility for this, in turn, carry the city as road construction wearer.
The conversion is therefore likely to attract liability disputes by themselves.
Since both timber removal and the turn in the current state of development worked, one should not agree to the restructuring of the railway crossing, argued Haas.
Also, at this point the risk of collision of the train with a subject on the transfer vehicle significantly lower than at the other crossings, because right next to the breakpoint center located, to which there is a good line of sight.
Even trains from Central Station forth would have to be slowed down at this point already so far that no collision threatens.
The majority of the reconstruction of this railway crossing has been denied approval, as the town of Schiltach, "would have to pay for" the problem with ride-on vehicles, the councils, as the train could withdraw from responsibility after completion of construction.
As unproblematic, the Panel considers the modifications of the level crossings "Before Heubach" and "Before Kuhbach" were made for the already crossing agreements with the railway.

Over the years Fays innovation was expanded, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines into being, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters this year.
"Most of these headliners began at Carolines and were then always successful until they were eventually to be known to occur in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event, there are appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as of "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefit for Army Veterans at Madison Square Garden where, among other things, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby occur.
With the festival also the world of comedy has grown.
A number of comedians who participate this year at the Festival, have become known through rather unconventional means, such as shipments to smaller television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.

Jenny Slate was both "Saturday Night Live" as well as "Parks and Recreation" part of the cast, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial issues Kaumau W. Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest attractions for visitors of the festival heard an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television program entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" in TV Land.
The meeting will take place in midtown Manhattan in the Town Hall.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he is here, he sometimes go through the alley between two buildings and think: Hey, if I lose all my money, then I might live here.

Due to safety concerns the visit of two facilities was not possible, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two locations were noisy Syrian statement "been abandoned ... and the present there objects of chemical weapons program had been transferred to other devices conforming to have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear if the site in Safira was one of two facilities that could not attend the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, the next month must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC.

RBS suspended two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign exchange department, two people familiar with the situation, which is another indication that global administrative inquiry into the alleged manipulation of the currency market absorbs rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigation of the world's largest financial market, go to the daily 5.3 quadrillion dollars the owner.
The two traders were the first RBS employees who were suspended in the widening investigation, to the Libor interbank business is picking up after the scandal.
The bank, which gave no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigations on this topic go on and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, reported the situation related parties that RBS have the records of e-mails and instant messages that were sent to and from a previous seller, the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority forwarded.
The dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and will now be granted leave of absence from his current position as the European leader of the forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was suspended this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any wrongdoing.
To Instant Message group of Usher were among bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said the situation related parties.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its staff, after the Swiss regulator FINMA had stated that it was examining an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six agencies around the world - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss Competition Authority Competition Commission, the FCA, the U.S. Justice Department and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - deal currently with allegations that bankers are said to have agreed in transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or receive requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these studies, the dealer puts in a region in turmoil who has heard in recent years to become one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it was virtually impossible to tamper with the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading dealers are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use our own internal platforms by banks to put back that "you can already influence with very low ticket prices the market."
The news came on the same day out when Credit Suisse announced that it had this week a dealer of their London Exchange Traded Funds offices terminated after he had late last year caused a loss of almost six million dollars.
The bank informed promptly by the competent authorities and cooperate with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained," said Credit Suisse.

Coulson put a phone hacking for checking a tip
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly put a "phone-hacking, surveillance and confrontation" when trying to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Andrew Edis QC prosecutor told the court at the Old Bailey, News of the World had in May 2005, a false rumor to the effect heard that Clarke was having an affair with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire hacking away at Pawlbys voicemails, and pursued them, but they Coulson also called and left messages, as the court was told.
"After the prosecutor believes Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, the one that stays and hopes to catch them in the act, but one that people like to face a story to see her reaction before the tabernacle of people is "said Edis.
He said NotW use three methods to investigative researching stories: Phone-hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows from the second, monitoring, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone-hacking decision?
He argues that from, but we say. "And if he knew about it"
Rumors of an affair Clarkes were first taken up by the feature editors of NotW, were told as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby: "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles together."
A band with voice mail on your phone at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, on the Pawlby and her sister were saved as "Projects".
In the time when the research led, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous phone calls in which they were asked for information about them, said Edis.
Meanwhile, supervised the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitoring the movements of Pawlby.
On 18 June 2005 Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis said Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important figures, such as the former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson Blunkett've faced because of an affair with a married woman, as he himself was romantically involved with co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny to have conspired with others, between the 3rd October 2000 and 9 August 2006 to hack phones.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have the phone-hacking added.

Early puberty: Getting faster grow
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes mean not just puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the epidemic obesity is a trigger early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should a parent be concerned when her daughter at the age of seven or eight years, breasts and pubic hair grow?
At the annual conference of the Children's Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, said the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these early physical changes are relatively common among American girls and a new norm represented.
"I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents - usually this is not a sign that puberty occurs quickly now," said Kaplowitz.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor to show up earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, it is only a slight shift in the age of menarche was (onset of menstruation) in the last 40 years.
In the United States the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to menarche," Kaplowitz said, also author of the book "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide for handling this frequent problem."
Time is the most accurate test, as puberty progresses.
It is unclear in what actually constitutes the onset of puberty, but it is "precocious" when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process is slowed or stagnated - something that can accurately monitor a pediatrician.
For faster progress tests might be indicated by a Endikronologen so serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatments for delaying an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small stature in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious when it comes to drugs, but he admits: ". Suppressing puberty can conduct problems and alleviate the feelings of girls to be different than their peers"
The other major problem is understandable: parents just do not want their very young daughters have the period.
"They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," said a woman whose daughter has received with its ten days reminder.
Although there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was scared and excited by the school to go home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensive published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are currently no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would cause.
Boys like girls come earlier puberty.
Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and the onset of puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be an early puberty of all sorts of things to be affected by economic conditions over the air to the genes.
Another mystery: Although boys facial and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend toward a full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and young children.
"We must be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician, as they should speak with their child.
"This may mean that you have to run earlier than expected a conversation," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who blossom early, need the insurance, this is the process a normal part of life, even if it is sooner than expected.

Before the derby against Schalke mitgereiste BVB supporters had taken care of with flares for ugly scenes at the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced to severe consequences.
Before Friday's game in the Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart Ultras responded with a silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which the viewer to park offered shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart at Signal Iduna.
To hear the guests were mostly fans with their songs.
The South Stand, however, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans are first presented itself exceptionally quiet: No chants, no battle cries.
The pedestal of the Capo, who usually coordinates the common accentuation remained unoccupied.
And the very front in the stands blew lonely a big flag with inscription "section stadium ban".
Just as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always became the first BVB players the place, surged on short-term jubilation.
When his teammates followed, there were loud singing and waving scarves - but not universally.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Stand nothing stirred.
The fact that the stadium announcer Norbert Dickel again the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract renewal of coach Jürgen Klopp - enumerated, did not care for celebratory mood.
It was not until five minutes before the kickoff of crested Capo his podium - and the hitherto almost tangible with hands tension erupted into a loud cry, as Dickel as usual queried the atmosphere in the stands at the stadium.
The last was, as always, the South Stand on the series - and was finally here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And as with the latest kick-off of the south stand the loud call "Derby winner will be on" came, everything was as usual again.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before derby against FC Schalke 04 some of the terraces BVB fans flares were fired into the stands and on the court - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was later kicked off because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received in his office the tops of Dortmund Ultras then - and is believed Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable for the fan representatives appointment.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire Ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure under Watzke said the ultras a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden," he explained.
The zero tolerance policy when it comes to pyrotechnics, we can not give up.
In addition, the Ultras different ways of punishment were demonstrated - until Tuesday they have now time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke, BVB will determine a sanction until the end of next week.
"This is drastic," assured Watzke.
It will be interesting how the responses to the South Stand fail then.

What happens on the go with my e-mail?
E-mail is, actually electronic letter.
Was similarly implemented in the design of the Internet e-mail service as in the conventional postal technically the secrecy?
In the design of the early Internet services was at the forefront to make communication possible.
Therefore, we did not pay for the basic technical protocols on creating a stable foundation for a anhörsicheren correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If Licensees "Anna" send an email to "Benni", the computers of the two are then connected directly?
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends in the first step the mail to the mail server of your service provider.
If she has, for example, a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider, the Benni uses.
On the route, the mail run on some other server on the Internet.
Bennie can then call from his provider of the content.
If conventional emails read along on their way through the net?
Most emails are on the go read several times by software robots.
The provider of the sender is checked in the rule, whether the mail leads a malicious program as an attachment with it.
A virus check is also done on the receiver systems.
Also, check the provider whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least wegsortiert in a spam folder.
Did the robots still another object?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needed to place contextual advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail on their upcoming holiday travel, Google may display appropriate links to holiday offers.
Read and unknown people with e-mails?
The likelihood that unauthorized people read along an e-mail, is extremely low.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies often administrators have the option to read along electronic mail.
The law enforcement and intelligence agencies have legal ways to intercept e-mails or to take note of.
There are also possible illegal Ausspäh actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mail messages against eavesdropping?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail will be encrypted effectively against eavesdropping.
With high technical complexity, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that may not even be readily recognized, who communicates with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
The mailboxes mainly privately used Yahoo and Google play according to a survey of Convios Consulting in August 2013 only a subordinate role.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail were last fallen, GMail Google could increase significantly.

Germany's largest regional church has started a campaign to promote the profession of the pastor.
Background is a potential priest shortage: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently about 1,800 pastors will halve According to our current location in 2030.
For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in an interview with the Evangelical Press.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine itself.
With Burfien the national church for the first time appointed a pastor on a full-time job to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, young people choose less and less after high school to study theology.
Burfien attributes this to the process of secularisation back: "God's voice is low, the world is loud."
Here, the profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can there my priorities set, where it is important to me.
Pastors could be as a pastor very close to the people.
They earned so much as a teacher and could live well.
Certainly get paid more in the private sector, but theologians have a safe employer.
The'll meet the young people of today, where there was not only a career, but a meaning to what we work.
According to the National Church, which comprises three-quarters of Lower Saxony, currently per year are around 60 pastors to retire.
At the same time begin about 40 graduates of theological studies her Vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or Wendland future it could be hard to fill positions.
Burfien plans to organize among other study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offer a broad education.
One can thus even be President.

Two charged with YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offenses: hearing before the Royal Commission
Two YMCA Leaders of New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offenses relating to children before 2011 allegations against the nannies Jonathan Lord were collected from Caringbah, such as the Royal Commission learned of sexual abuse of children.
But at the opening statement to the Commission of the YMCA had declared that they had "never had to do in the organization with an incident of child sexual abuse".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of misdemeanor child pornography, and another was convicted at which a physical education instructor of Caringbah YMCA Hall in 1991 for the abuse of entrusted him children.
Hare said Gail Furness, a Commission assistive lawyer that he was aware of the first case, the second but have not known.
He conceded the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission should also have been inaccurate in the assertion that "there had been external audits of the YMCA, where the YMCA was recognized as at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the Commission to show rather that the YMCA was informed that he has received the second-lowest rating of the four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of this year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, acknowledged that management had failed "from me on down" in the setting of Lord and failed to ensure that staff had been out of their obligations clear to violations of the Guidelines for child safety Report.
Lord was sentenced earlier this year for sexual offenses against twelve boys during his two years with the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem, the employee had held them to report violations Lords in relation to the safety of children.
The employees testified that they had observed violations, among other things, that the Lord was alone with children, she worked privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his lap, to a said that he had to love it, and let children play with his cell phone .
Danielle Ockwell whose superior lord was and had asked for a training course on child protection, because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the children's ministry director Jacqui Barnat that the supervisor was Lords in YMCA Caringbah, "very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable war ".
The manager stated that he would not accept statements from employees, which they had not dared to report to their superiors message.
Instead, he said, had rather affected her friendship with Lord their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare said he had the board of the YMCA NSW communicated its view that the lesson had to be learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" the organization, "not the answer" concerns by employees, and the Board have agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to urge the employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the appearance of the allegations, had been hit by the managing director of children services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said they were designed to prevent contamination of the evidence, which had been implemented but "overzealous" and bad.
The YMCA NSW was in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 there was no safe for children's organization, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in hiring, review, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was to 20 December was postponed.

Tourism: descent to the Romans
At around 120 meters in length, a sewer from the Roman period has been preserved beneath Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, can not ignore the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers in the sky, making it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who marvel at the two filigree spiers, knowing that it is also under the cathedral to discover a lot.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for its tours is the service center of Cologne tourism next to the cathedral.
The tour begins at the very unspectacular: "We start in the garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore remained of the ruins of the ancient city walls, only the stand, which was not too great.
Most users of the car park therefore now rushing past also to the Roman remains and turn off only her car.
But if you look twice, discovered a severed by metal bars archaeological site in the parking deck D2.
On display are about five feet high ruins of palm-sized stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to light, can Schulze participants on the upper parking level another look into a dark, 15-meter shaft throw.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which is, unfortunately, hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants again descend into the depths.
We see here the official seat of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
What does CCAA would like to know a visitor.
"The acronym stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium "what good German as much as" city of Roman law and the city Agrippinenser, founded by Emperor Claudius in the place of the altar for the imperial cult "means".
And the judgment hall is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel entrance leads to the Roman sewer that is available here at around 120 meters in length.
"You can calm a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima go along if you want," Schulze cheers for the guests.
A surprise has Schulze yet.
After he has brought the key to the box office, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walk-in bay.
"We are now in a mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual ablutions.
To date, in the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing level of the Rhine.
The mikvah is part of an archaeological zone in the town square, for which construction is scheduled to begin shortly.
Until the completion but still will take some years.

George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story to independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about passport checks in Berwick and secured with barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
In fact it has been on the potential economic benefits noted in the Strathclyde template that would bring more freedom to travel the rest of Europe with it, but played it - as expected - in the headlines not matter.
Also no one has mentioned that the EU Member States often rightly turn their strict rules when it is convenient for them.
As Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So really no story.
And one that is already so come in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I used the "independence means passport control" Duck heard years ago at least 40.
Here an interesting point when constantly repeating this ancient history is lost.
Why should one expect from an independent Scotland that it dances to the European pipe?
Why swap the yoke against the London from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The big, ducted after the war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the EU, parties gain ground, which are EU-hostile or want to have the euro as their common currency overboard.
Even in Germany was the euro-skeptic party alternative for Germany - founded only this year - nearly five million votes snag in the general election in September for themselves and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There have always been local opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the restrictions imposed by Berlin and the European Central strict austerity policy in conjunction with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is constrained by adherence to the single currency, many people believe, the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits - this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the euro system has its members nailed on exchange rates, which are advantageous for German exporters - and want German politicians like to be so.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe is with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany again.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - inspired by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the prescribed from Brussels 'green' energy policy - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - pay to European industry compared with the United States twice for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we could see in Grangemouth.
All wage commits the world to protect the European petrochemical industry is not about to be pushed by cheap American shale gas in the corner.
As a result, draws up a revolt, especially in France, the EU's former cheerleader.
After the war saw the French political elite, the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and could lift Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin Paris needs no more than the gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has pushed its own economic policy, which the ailing French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election and thus the ruling Socialists referenced third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to the British Labour Party that they can not assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What makes Le Pen with her newly gained popularity among the white French the working class?
You want to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-single currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in this election - and this is very possible - then could the first time such a block, the European Parliament dominate.
This is the point at which I'm getting at: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations," the General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro firm, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain distances from this project in hopes to curry favor with the United States.
However, suggests Washington's growing interest in the Pacific that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which also involves Berlin and Brussels to say what they can stick it where.
I suspect Scotland could go quite well in a looser European alliance, if we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider to emulate Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has a spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and made​​) won in 2011 cuts that the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib were responsible for the coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland, now to decide for independence to get forced austerity only to Berlin and Brussels.

FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but no cell phone conversations)
Air travelers can hear from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading, working, games, music and use the watching movies, but not on a call with the phone now, the new Directives on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were issued in the United States.
However, the passengers should not expect that these changes are implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, would depend on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta told a press conference.
The airlines need the FAA to demonstrate that airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight personnel as well as the arrangements for the storage of the device according to the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received from some airlines plans that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Under these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could expand the use of electronic devices very soon approve," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
It may not start up if the airplane has reached a height of three kilometers and is the captain of the green light.
Upon entering the landing, passengers must switch it off again and may not restart them before the plane landed.
Under the new guidelines could airlines whose planes were protected against electronic interference, allow their passengers to use the equipment even when off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new aircraft and other airmen who were converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regime is implemented safely - and we are therefore cooperating closely with the airline -, the two sides will benefit," said Glading.
It is we honestly sorry to feel on this issue as watchdogs.
Never-theless Internet connections for surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers still prohibited, explained the authority.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So no still "Words With Friends" which Scrabble similar online game, in 2011, played the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone when he had publicity leave a jet of American Airlines, because he refused to turn off the power while the the aircraft was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored, since the possibility of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone conversations during the flight also remain still prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA lifts ban possibly for certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing on
Last month, said Mark Rosenker of the Highway Traffic Safety Administration National Transportation Safety Board, a security expert for national transport issues at CBS News, cellphones would still be considered a risk.
"Mobile is really a problem, not only because it could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can interfere with transmission towers," said Rosenker.
An advisory committee of industry, which was launched to study this topic by the FAA, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on the use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argued that there was no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also more difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is mentioned that forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device up to a third of the passengers.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers after reports of disturbance of navigation and communication devices carried by passengers FM radios had become known at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they make electronic interference nothing.
Airlines offer passengers for a few years Wi-Fi if the altitude has been reached.
The adapted to Wi-Fi systems flyers are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices emit radio in general much less radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, emit minimal radiation when page is turned.
But when downloading or sending of data transmission values ​​are stronger.
Among the advocates of a relaxation of the limitations of the instruments use by passengers counts Amazon.com.
2011 invited company employees a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made ​​a test flight, to identify problems, but could not find.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk involved in the use of equipment.
Douglas Kidd from the passenger National Association of Airline Passengers said he was of the view that failure by the device was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only scattered reports of pilots who speak for a failure of aircraft systems by the device, and most of them are very old.
The committee recommended that the FAA, however, to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the equipment by the passengers during instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A grouping of the travel industry welcomed the changes, described it as a reasonable accommodation for travelers who would now be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.

Freudenstadt: Fast actions by surprise host
With a small squad, the men had to TSV I Freudenstadt start of the Schiller-school gymnasium in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
Although the Älbler were associated with an experienced team on the other line side.
Soon, however, showed that they also age-related, could keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstädter not quite.
With the hard and placed premiums on the Gönninger did extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the clean on the network center leaked by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz passes and attacks and were not in the block defense on the spot.
Two high first sentence profits expressed clearly from the superiority of Freudenstadt in all respects.
Faced with this overwhelming and decisive game performance then the third set was a bit lax and lethargic for 3-0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22) won.
Since the second November communicate with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to prevail in clear Nagold, a much more powerful opponent on the field.

In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They gave off a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused primarily when receiving a pass error and points gifts, even when the passes, the precision was sometimes in short supply and in some critical scenes prevented the excessive zeal of the view point of potential profits.
In terms of performance this very balanced encounter in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto agreed but throughout the great physical effort and a welcome commitment by both teams.

Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the population at an early stage in the planning," Mayor Jens Haussler opened the public information event for flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the church hall to be explained the measures envisaged to ask questions, voice concerns and suggest ideas.
Haussler clarified: "The final decisions make the members of the council."
The floods, the Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared met, was a decisive event was, that raised the question of safeguards for the future, said Haussler.
A river basin study had been given with the neighboring community Aidlingen in order, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many of developed land is the goal," said Haussler.
Is presumed to be the planning of protection against a loud German Weather Service statistically every 100 years to the expected flood.
The climate change is supported by a 15 percent surcharge invoice.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that had led to considerable damage Gechingen 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement we can achieve," said Haussler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros to be invested in Gechingen, the community can expect to land grants in the amount of about 70 percent.
Haussler pointed out, however, that it only give the promotion, if an overall concept would be implemented.
For this, the community is dependent on the participation of citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case could be in 2016 started to implement.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented already in the past week in the council sees (we reported) before local action in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley.
Following the presentation of the flood risk management strategies, the participants took the opportunity to express their concerns.
Among other things, has been questioned, why do not more dams and retention basins are planned for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kühn, planners of the engineering firm contracted forest and hills Corbe from home, who introduced the concept, emphasized that it needed the cooperation of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
Moreover, it should be held to find the most economical solution, Joachim forest by forest and Corbe.
There was resentment among local residents of Altorts who have to suffer even in normal thunderstorms repeatedly to overloading of the sewerage network.
The problem is known in the management and first steps have already been taken.
Haussler noted, however, that the guidelines for duct systems are other than for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality has an obligation, the sewer system be designed so that two-to three-year rain events could be coped with.
The sewers to be dimensioned larger, millions would swallow.

The redesigned Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and return.
One that would make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu is referred to according to the dictionary a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling that you have ever experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the eponymous cafes on Opschlag in the county town of Kleve in sight of the Rhine-Waal University it does not stick to the pure déjà vu feeling.
Finally, the cafe is with the beautiful name exactly the goal: to make actual stay not only mental, but always by hand repeatedly experienced.
Because it's just fun and simply beautiful.
A look inside the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer an instant good feeling.
The ultra-modern, but not cool café ambience, looks like a place to relax.
Here the team spoils with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Buettner at the top of the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variations.
In addition there is delicious cake or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old have made ​​a name as a restaurateur before the opening of this lovely cafes on Opschlag, In Kranenburg they brought the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve on the Opschlag the sympathetic café lovers hope more audience.
Not least by the university.
"Where we have no particular target group," says Daniel Buettner.
Rather, the two would like to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all ages in between.
Apropos coffee-Liebhaber.
The friendly owner couple is standing behind the coffee enjoyment.

Daniel Buettner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"For this, a baguette - that's my thing," she says of the NRZ.
Two events gave it even in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbor festival became incarnate rather be outdoors - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe Daniel Buettner is therefore not a huge fan of event evenings: "Man's can now times not please everyone".
And with an event I always speak to only those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events are more likely to be the exception for us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible".
Should read: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which more and more is becoming a restaurant mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students discover the Gastro mile and thus the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in economy class on long-haul flights, which set the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow indicates this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width, the passengers will be offered during long flights in economy class - not always the ones to try on most airlines, but this designated area is the key to the efficiency claims in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing CO.
Airbus called this week an industry standard, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but the American archrival Boeing says it should be decided by the airlines.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturer vying even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft for sale, and in the event of 17 to 21 November record expected orders.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed - especially if there are a series of nine or ten seats - is crucial for the specified economic results that will supply the new "mini-jumbo" style.
Boeing claims its modernized "777x" summarize 406 people in seats in economy class, which are about 17 inches wide and so allow ten per row.
Airbus stated that the competing version of the A350 befördere 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in economy class, where there are nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share of blows on the technical details through advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus appeals before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777x is expected to make more than 100 orders the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company introduced a display in front of which are the beginning of a new war could display and donors showed a picture in which three people squeezed together sit in a restaurant, and to the title: "Would you accept this"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in sitting in front of which are narrower than regional turboprops," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In view of changed eating habits, people are getting fatter, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747, the modern long-distance travel-defined, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
Waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st Century is, according to U.S. health statistics 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival to take hold of a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly christened "Jet Set" was narrower.
You have so Airbus, conducted studies showing that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat, the Sleep Quality Increase by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the figures of Airbus to the seat dimensions and says it is not left to the discretion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines make the balance between fares and furnishings.
The company also declared, according to studies depended on the experience in the airplane over the seat width.
"It really boils down to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they need in their view, to be successful," explained the flight cabin expert Kent Craver, Boeing.
You do not want that we dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it's about more elbow room, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that may affect the sales.
Behind the dispute is a race to aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion dollars at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a significant impact on the export performance of the U.S. or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the debate on the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claiming 20 percent more efficient per seat in its latest twin-engine long-range designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements Boeings to the results depend in part on the fact that the 777x with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 is compared.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than in currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"That's why Boeing squeezes more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products there," says Kevin Keniston, Director for passenger comfort in the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say, full cabin with ten seats per row indicated at existing 777s out that many passengers opted for the closer arrangement, which may be associated with cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inches Seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin interior, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing are no seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can select.
The globe-trotting jet-seller even wear tape measure with you to remeasure the device during the competition.
Even if they promote the comfort, but so have all manufacturers also use jets of highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten seater ranks, but still has not sold his own words.
Until recently Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered for some Jets wide seats in the aisles.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call will fizzle out after a new industry standard probably, but might distract from the shaft of 777x sales.

Veganism is subordinated to the vegetarianism, according to dictionaries, differs from this but in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians eating cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam allow these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to not eating meat and fish can be from the vegans from all consumption of animal products - honey is denied.
What remains, one might ask, but upon closer inspection, the vegan diet world characterized by a considerable ingenuity from.
"Spreads are very popular," says Ute Henkel man, the owner of the local health food store that holds a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also visited the store in Domgasse like.
For 13 years, the New Zealand-born vegan, in Lampert home he finds (almost) everything on what he needs to live. "In 1997, I introduced to my diet and became a vegetarian."
Around the turn of the century was the next step and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the food but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers leatherette normal leather.
He realized that it's also in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, be a vegan ethics.
"I do not need that animals die for me," Proctor says of the maxim of vegans, who covers the entire consumer behavior.
Instead of burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears hinterherzutrauern, the vegans have quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "actually puts his vegan any waiver, no asceticism, but also it is an asset." The assumption that reducing the variety of dining options with the change in diet, Proctor rather leads back to the force of habit.
And these conditionings could also fail no matter how many well-intentioned attempt.
"The addiction factor is a crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," says Proctor on a comparison.
And a used: "Certain tastes are not moor at the beast."
Often it's the spices or the type of preparation that make up the flavor.
"But you can produce the same effect in other ways," says the vegans.
At a barbecue brings Proctor example, eggplant, mushrooms and a few Veganwürste.
He shall ensure a balanced and varied diet, which is quite well once should taste savory.
Of course you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It is supposed to taste, but this is to reduce not only on animal food," says Proctor.
Harmful effects to eating disorders, a more widespread acceptance that he had not suffered.
For me, the change has had a positive aspect.
I take no strange cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood values ​​are well, I'll often check," says Proctor.
Especially against the lack of vitamin B12 warn Vegansimus many critics.
"Because animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing in the pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer, the vitamin B12 content is high," says Proctor.
For vegans, it also give you the opportunity to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets to be.
"My B12 levels are fine," he explains.
Long distances must not go Proctor for food procurement.
Staple food, there is finally everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find locally.
Only now and then I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that just only the finished products are expensive, but so is the case with" ordinary "finished products are also known to".
In any case, the preparation vegetarian dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than generally believed.
"In the home kitchen, there is much to discover, with a few minor tweaks can be good, if not in some cases better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbonated instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake was able to bring his parents to marvel Proctor.
Family celebrations gives the vegans a new spice.
This has momentum when you cook together, which has a new significance.
"The situations which may thereby arise are as varied as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course skepticism but it has also been met with.
No longer tastes good my food?
"Should I now feel bad because I drink milk?" - For of these questions one must act as a vegan with tact.
"I do not reject people from yes, I am part of this society," Proctor would eke no Enklavendasein.
And a closer look at the everyday world then did not appear so veganfremd as suspected - and the vegans not as restricted as is commonly assumed in everyday life.
Fast food is also allowed.
Fries are everywhere!
"Many kebab shops sell falafel, or even a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he will fallback to pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants provide so slowly respond.
"When I started 13 years ago to feed me vegan, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealanders can make a development track down: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If enough requests come, they may be inclined to add to the menu," he hopes.
Vegan Restaurants evolve, such as the galley in Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei.
Proctor who desires that other restaurants have at least stand a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically are vegan dishes for everyone.
Everyone can eat, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, however, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scares, then veganism is a sure way to make the most part impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the shopping vegan products can be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand the animal additives contained in peanuts as colorants his can, it seems to leave quickly to compliance with the ethics of so many hurdles and pitfalls of courage.
Not only, therefore, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried food but also detergents.
"Gradually, you develop a scanner look and know what signs and logos you have to look out for" It's sometimes better to do small steps than stand still or to stumble, "says Proctor.
The veganism, it is an important moral clue who beats on consciousness.
Perhaps he did not make it all that it stores its habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critical.

Bavaria's basketball team optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euro League was at the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich do not detract from the huge optimism.
"No one can forbid us to believe in it to win against the best team in Europe over the last two years," reported Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: In Munich there is basketball!
In their only third appearance in Europe's premier class, the Munich-selling long very well, were in the crucial stages but just do not clarified enough.
Guests initially managed the feat of a 15-point deficit to convert 13 minutes before the end, in a lead before Piraeus gave the game again a turn.

New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking put an end
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice against a lifetime of nicotine addiction.
Before testing in humans, further experiments are needed, which may still take some years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results look good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination once can help millions of smokers who tried to quit and have tried doing all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an innocuous virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker experiences nicotine high.
In experiments retained vaccinated mice which nicotine was administered at their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination against it would have taken a "time-out" the researchers a sign declared that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations needed to maintain the antibody level are so often given that they were expensive and impractical.
However the cost of the new vaccine are probably much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, could be a future human vaccine when he was quite sure children are administered before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely is that smokers would use him to quit.
"You know then: When they start to smoke again, they feel because of the nicotine vaccine no more pleasure here, and that helps them to take the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned at the same time, it is still more research is needed.

Egypt's first president sworn in freely chosen
Mohammed Mursi sets from the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt," as he was sworn in as the first elected president of the country and thus the successor of Hosni Mubarak took, which had been 16 months previously expelled from office.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist President of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy, about 60 years ago.
He swore the oath before the 18 dressed in black robes judges of the court, which has its headquarters on the Nile, and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people has laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, a trained in the U.S. engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group since its inception was usually taken 84 years ago as a proscribed organization by the government sharply targeted.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarding the building, as Mursi shortly after eleven clock local time, arrived in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential pomp of the Mubarak-time traffic was only briefly halted so that the convoy could cross the usually busy street, with the city center connects the southern suburbs.
Derided as uncharismatisches "spare" the Brotherhood has his personal prestige increased since his victory and a Friday khutbah in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who ans the aspirations of the uprising from the year 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak wanted to bring destination.
"Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state", in a blue suit with red tie dressed Mursi told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army band playing the national anthem, to which he listened at attention.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds present in the largest auditorium at the University with chants of "The army and the people are one hand."
Erected as a bastion of secular education in 1908 from Cairo University has evolved in the 1970s into a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Mursi presented on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square from, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of the authoritarian Mubarak's rule last year, and he vowed presidential powers to reclaim that took over from the hunted out of office President of the Military Council.
However, with the drop of the official oath before the Court and not as usual in front of the Parliament he obeys the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.

Frontier Airlines charges fees for carry-on luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 dollars of passengers who want to stow carry-on baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to up to 100 dollars for one piece of hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda to calculate, even if one could read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers could keep the whole tin.
The new fee applies to carry-on luggage in the overhead compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said, compute 25 U.S. dollars if the charge is paid in advance, and $ 100 in travelers who had paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of U.S. $ 100 Aim, travelers to move to take care of in advance of the payment.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines began in 2008 in order to charge a fee for the first and second checked bag.
Passengers who tried to circumvent these have, therefore, as much as possible crammed into hand luggage, which has the consequence that the overhead bins are often crowded on the seat.
Fees are one way to move passengers to be less to take on board.
O'Malley said at the new fee, it had not actually about making money.
This is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, which would have made ​​clear that there would always be difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website, do not pay.
This means that a passenger must be present at the boarding gate of Frontier may take one piece of luggage free, but the next person has to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley stated that the site of Frontier and the check-in procedure would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they came to the gate.
The new baggage fee of Frontier occurs only in the summer in force an exact date, there are not.
Passengers complain frequently about Baggage fees and other charges, but airlines like to grab it back.
They argue that the transport of luggage and passengers should cost money to pay for this service if they wanted him.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees as a sign that the airlines make enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have so far, however, the finger of fees for carry-on luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years before the first penalty for hand luggage and later, Allegiant Air, also a low cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who pursues the additional fees carefully.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit transferring 50 million U.S. dollars annually.
Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious what to expect him at the gate when passengers would be faced with the unusual hand baggage charge of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I've experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and palpable discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding went well."
Frontier Spirit also follows for the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company said that passengers who bought lemonade or juice, could keep the whole tin and coffee is refilled for free.
Water remains free of charge.
U.S. Airways 2008 had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks, but this made ​​seven months later reversed after passengers complained and no other large company had followed.
Frontiers step to charge fees for carry-on luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative should be directed to the customers on your own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 U.S. dollars per ticket sold.
This provides all the companies an incentive to passengers to move to the direct purchase from them instead of using an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, is gone furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive when booking through an online travel agency only half the number of frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday, the miles were further reduced to 25 percent of the route.
Booked at a third-party flight with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers therefore a still only 250 miles.
Passengers can book on the website of Frontier courts exclusively for direct purchase.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
The proceeds declined by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as we read in the financial report, which was released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.,.
Republic has been trying to get in connection with the sale of the company's finances by Frontier under control.

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled up wrestling mat in the gym in high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was born on 11 January found in an upright erected mat that stood behind the bleachers in the school gym.
The investigating officer of the Sheriff of Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but this questions the family of the 17-year-olds.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer from Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, opposite FoxNews.com.
You would never have thought he was died as it had concluded the sheriff.
"They are of the view that it was devoid of any logic, against the laws of physics as well as against the common sense contrary," said Crump.
Rather, they were convinced that the truth may be covered up to protect the person or persons who were responsible for the death of her son.
"My son went to study in the school and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation in death Johnson, as a number of important questions remained unsolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
The Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, the direction in which they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that a reasonable basis for a formal determination is made," he said.
Moore told reporters that initial autopsy value implies that Johnson had died from the effects of a "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy have, however, found a different cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions answered or need to be confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnson, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the authority of the County Sheriff was at our request on Thursday ready to go immediately to a comment.
A court in southern Georgia ruled on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that have analyzed the investigators.
The parents of the teens said they hoped that the video records contained evidence how he had died.

John Kerry declared in an unprecedented admission that the U.S. spy was "inappropriate gone too far"
John Kerry pointed with an unexpected confession softening of the defensive attitude of the United States in relation to their monitoring programs, saying that espionage was "inappropriate gone too far" in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted he wore in common with Barack Obama's responsibility to ensure that you have switched on "autopilot", as the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden about the espionage activities of the NSA were publicly.
With the leaked information, the U.S. government is caught in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
When a transmitted by video link address to the Open Government Conference in London Kerry said: "There is no question the President and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have expired almost on autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was, what is still to the Second World war and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course on the 11th September back. "
Then he admitted to be the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that the U.S. spy've crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights have been abused.
He said: "In some cases that is too far gone inappropriate."
The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore performs a thorough investigation, so no one needs to feel, think here abuse instead.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process.
Kerry insisted upon, that the NSA is a force for good and many lives were saved by their monitoring operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to devote themselves to blow up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent on killing people to blow into the air and attack governments.
What would be if you would be able to intercept that and to stop before it happened?
We actually have plane crashes, attacks on buildings and murdering people prevented because we have learned in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe in order to dispel the concerns about the alleged American spy and the Europeans to convince them of the need to continue to cooperate in anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and was worried because of their threats, no longer to participate in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration with the monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who first sits as a Democrat in the Senate and as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and the European Affairs is working, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe, have relations with some U.S. allies charged, although the head of the secret service stated this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected from NATO allies and had been replaced with the United States.
Other revelations cited on endorsed by Snowden documents, according to which the NSA had monitored the phone by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spy to his allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult Murphy said that his agency prepare the journey of the Congress before, to be held this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of other participating members to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary will still be worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also assumed that there would be some "serious words."
He said European governments need to be honest about the kind of spying programs that they themselves inserting years their population against.
"While we can change our monitoring programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, stands for John Kerry at the weekend, a trip to the Middle East and to Poland in order to deal there with the resentment of the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt, Iran and the U.S. surveillance activities.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott have a conflict of interest regarding parental leave
The billionaire Clive Palmer and MPs says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters are pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.
The mining magnate who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6,000,000 to CO2 tax, put forward the assertion, as if to wipe issues off the table if he were in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could take up to four votes in the Senate control, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or truncated.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the Daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the law.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether they receive holiday or not," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission declared Palmer with 53-vote lead after the recount officially the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the process of vote counting, so that, proceeds faster.
Tony Abbotts Töchter Frances und Bridget.
Should these elections be held two months after the end of voting?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which we marched in, enters data into a computer, dialed immediately and then at 6:30 clock in the evening was the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
To use it, because then you can erase the results if you do not like one?
Nowadays tune with pencils is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has the options for electronic voting tested and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that for his policies belong to an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take up his new duties "very seriously".
In a public office was about the service to the public.
"We seek no reward except the history, namely, that we can serve in a critical period of this community," he said.

Esa decides on major space missions: Missions for Everyone
Distant planets, black holes or gravitational waves - experts from the European Space Agency to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years now.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Worlds.
More than 1000 planets around other stars, astronomers have found.
Whether there is at least on some of them life, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: If you search for gravitational waves?
Or rather probe the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
The questions were just the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to advance research critical.
The budget for such an "L" missions is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected in 2028 and 2034.
Early September, met in Paris the elite of European space research, to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of which have now come into the shortlist.
Numerous committees examine the proposals, hook at the researchers after.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the scientific program committee.
A total of four big questions has selected the ESA, to which the missions of the program initiated in 2007 "Cosmic Vision" to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars of large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And when a star has planets, under what circumstances can there life arise?
To answer this question is to start the 2017 Space Telescope "Cheops", with the 500 previously known planetary systems are examined in more detail in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could depict Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and so search for "biomarkers": gases which are considered as evidence for biological activity.
How does the solar system?
This question will ultimately shed light on what are the requirements for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes examine an example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" Esa has been a mission of M-class (where the budget is around half a billion euros) approved for this question.
The probe is to start in 2017 and observe surface area and activity of the sun exactly.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For the ESA provides for the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) starts her journey is expected in 2022.
Eight years later they reached Jupiter and is the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede investigate.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate as to whether our known laws of nature are there still valid.
Maybe you will also find deviations that could physicists point the way to a new theory that can unite under whose umbrella all known laws of nature.
How did the universe come and what is it made?
13.7 billion years ago our universe was created by the Big Bang.
Besides we are familiar matter from which stars, planets and living beings as we exist, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy, through whose work is accelerating the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers know neither what physical laws were valid in the first fraction of a second of the Big Bang, nor from which there are dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" the Esa has also been granted an M-mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and thus allow conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals will be left at the end of the selection process only two.
Has the best chance of a license as L-Mission, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a challenging concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Among physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
Proved they were not until today.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three probes detector which is stationed in space.
He could, in contrast to plants on Earth also demonstrate gravitational waves that have arisen during the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals still compete at the second L-Mission: a large X-ray telescope named "Athena", which will explore, among other black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the "exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
Already excreted include suggestions for sample return transport from Mars, the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics.

CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such policy that has provided the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children increases with food allergies.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent, according to the CDC between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools, which are to raise awareness of food allergies in faculty and staff and as with children should be handled that show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine available - Auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used - in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction may.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrine simple stock.
The report also provides a list of typical symptoms is included, which are called by children having an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue", "My tongue feels as if it is a hair" or "My tongue tingles".

Firemen called to rescue a puppy that was stuck 15 feet above the ground on a dangerous cliff in a quarry
Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in their plight
Firemen roped off of cliff and rescued the dog from the certain death
The fire department is to bring a pooch in safety, was stuck on a 15-meter-high ledge in a cliff succeeded.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued on Wednesday from a quarry.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who own the dog, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby back to reception and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing dog and cries for help posted on social networks, as they had run away after the small traffic accident in the quarry.
Around 14:15 clock on Wednesday saw a walker, who walked his dog, the Ruby stranded on the 15-meter-high heel quarry.
The technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and roped off to save Ruby's, which was then transported in a dog cage upward.
Andy Clayton, specialist technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
She was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the bottom removed.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue - she was like frozen stiff.
But now she's fine.
She has subsequently eaten a few dog biscuits.
This was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky."
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the vet for examination, but except exhaustion and dehydration nothing found.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "In watching the rescue was scary."
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold them back in the arms.
The vet said that if the fatigue has gotten too big and it would have collapsed, they would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done a great job.
It was really brave what they have done.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that they would fall off, but it stayed up."

Discovered "super tunnel" for drug smuggling: U.S. border
On the border between Mexico and the U.S. investigators have a "super" tunnel discovered and shut down for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities said that more than 500 meters long tunnel between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system was equipped.
Three suspects were arrested accordingly, seized eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel had not been reported to be taken in use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think that they could dig under the radar of time," said the Attorney General of the U.S. District Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the discovered one end of the tunnel had been.
Addressing the drug gangs assured Duffy: "If you continue to build such tunnels and tries to use them, we are determined to do so at a huge waste of your dirty money".
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a continuous battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, in Mexico more than 77 000 people were killed in connection with drug-related crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the elaborate features of the tunnel go investigators believe that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year to complete.
The track system was equipped so that there electrically powered cars could be used.
On the Mexican side of the entrance is in a building that is 80 meters away from the border.
According to authorities, leads a ladder 20 feet in depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters wide.
He would have been so well suited to promote illegal immigration towards the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine-Fund.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the seized marijuana.
All three threatened lifetime maximum sentence imprisonment, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels were discovered, it was said at the press conference in San Diego on.
It was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel.
Typically, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through the tunnel.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes were now cut off, Bill Sherman said of DEA DEA in San Diego.
You would do anything to get into the United States.
Those detained details were not known, at least one is Mexican, it said.
You should expect to prison terms of up to ten years.

Obama's back down in health policy
After heavy criticism President Obama made yesterday backtracked on his often repeated unambiguous promise: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands from their insurer have received a letter of termination, the Republicans accused the President before the last few days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama qualified his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to numerous media reports on the dismissal Obama urged those Americans who have received such notices, on, look around on the open market for a new insurance policy.
Most citizens could obtain a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"You get a better deal," he said.
The government said it is not surprising that the five percent of the population having completed an insurance policy would have to look for another deal, since its contract did not meet the new standards by the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans very directly: You deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform had gone "miserable" since October.
"I'm as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This saying of an applied Sebelius to a seated behind her adviser at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a debate with Republican Deputies Billy Long of Missouri. It was about whether they should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours hearing Long Sebelius pressed repeatedly with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act have voluntarily waived a government-sponsored insurance to themselves enter into a collective at HealthCare.gov, which they now sell millions of Americans wanted.

Parents of intersex children can choose "Sex undetermined"
Germany is the first European nation where a third gender is recognized for children who were born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn is assigned no longer rigid male or female.
Under the new law parents have to explain no more sex for such children, but can "undefined" or "not set" on the birth certificate specify.
Objective of the Act is to take the pressure off parents so they have to make any hasty decisions regarding surgery for sex reassignment in the newborn, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said according to the BBC years later: "I am neither male nor female."
I remain the patchwork that was created by doctors, maimed and scarred.
It is estimated that comes one of 2,000 children each year either as a boy or as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual.
Understanding the gender identification is still not very well developed, but guess most experts in the United States, and thus you should use the best information available to gender assignment, if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you look at - if at all - decide for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has focused on the problem of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersexed children represent an ethical dilemma
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention is required, but for most children is not that," he said.
One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how developing the identity.
The scientific data about how a child ever develops his gender identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but because of their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously defined or not clearly identified as one of them.
These characteristics were evident in subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination, which intersex and transgender people see exposed in the workplace and the extent of harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Not with the gender image matching boys now have a special camp.
It is now possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to state on official documents male, female or "third gender".
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "genderless" person after a court lifelong maintenance of an "unspecified" had conceded gender status.
German ID cards have next to M and W in the future a third assignment, X for intersexual, the Ministry of Interior.
In neighboring France Gender issues are still controversial, as a news story on France 24
2011 signed dozens of French MEP strict Catholic country, a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, on the grounds: "If the world is dragged into a new state, where sex is a choice, but not sexual activity, then we rotate two other pillars of civilization. "
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone, they think it would be better if babies will be assigned a gender at birth.
"The parenting is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of one's child," she told the parents website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically children who were both born with male and female sexual organs, referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, looked at the medical gender as something you could wipe out and then rebuild.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation be challenged after it is now known how complex gender identity, and that physicians also may be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing with that of their assigned gender.
"Middle of the 20th Century it was called a psychiatric emergency, '"Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then you did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that gender is malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental stimuli - such as parents raising a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped as to whether a person consider to be male or female.
But in one, known under the title "John / Joan" case from 1966 his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision, to castrate the child completely and remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but what he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of gender operations have replaced the public, "not happy with the result" are.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So its external organ and testes were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew that I'm not a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should get a vaginoplasty.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth - and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, by which his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of the genitals.
After learning the truth, he transferred back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed himself.
He has become infertile due to the operation.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project that intersex individuals are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "encourage stamping and stigmatize" could.
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and the child with a not fixed 'results," she explained.
We fear that favors interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex, and then to be seen.
But still we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law, because "it allows adult recognition as a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she explained.
In German law it comes to the assignment at birth.
This is not a battle, to which one should force young children at this time.
When they grow, they can decide on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of other supports in a support group, says the German law "authorize" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity.
Because of the receptor defect in the target cells for testosterone Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married, she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, hopes, however, to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room, so they have to make decisions should not be rushed," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do various tests and to clarify things, giving them time before they "male" or "female" writing.
In this way everything is in order - you pull the child tall and loves it.
It has a wonderful baby and enjoys the parents happiness.
And one must not rush to make an operation that can not be undone.
"That includes the children in the decision and eliminate the fear that haunts parents, because they think they would not do the right thing," she said.
Ultimately decides the child's sex, the better suits him - and that is wonderful.
Thus children are able to make the decision themselves.

Excellent battle mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novella "The Old Man and the Sea", Horst Janson is cut to the body.
Janson is himself a veteran of his craft, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago none can be fishing kidding.
Thus, the two complement each other great.
One seems almost to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom saith the fisher boy Manolo.
When Santiago sits hunched tired of living on the chair, that's really at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that copes Janson excellent.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and eventually by his knowledge and his strength of will win the fight against the fish.
Janson is long stretches as sole performer on stage.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues no moment are boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water, are so real that the audience forget that the sea but consists only of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat act before the fishing village.

Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing in the dark ice - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals exploited and transformed it into a brilliant treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the glowing protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, whereby the pH is raised in the protein and the lights will be triggered.
Chris explains, the ice cream react to the heat and light in the mouth - so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream responsive to the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth is heated, the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful glow effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream that I have ever made​​, because of the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball cost me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf belong.
But his latest creation to be even more ambitious.
He says: "I ​​would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
That in and of itself impossible due to the refraction of light, which is caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream is, but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream utilizes the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are manufactured by Chinese scientists artificially

Google, Samsung, Huawei weigh Nortel patents verklagt
The group, which has thousands of former Nortel patents, struggled on Thursday to an avalanche of lawsuits for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbid on the bankruptcy auction of Nortel from him.
Rockstar consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion dollars, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies sued for patent infringement before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents relate to technology, put the search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising in agreement, the suit so that goes to the heart of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that use Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with the mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid over $ 900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google raised its offer several times and offered last 4.4 billion U.S. dollars.
After being outbid on the Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion U.S. dollars, a business that was also motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in suit of the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so," says the statement of claim.
Rockstar calls a high damages from Google because it claims Google's patent infringement was intentional, so the accusation.

Frankfurt parking fees are to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be significantly more expensive.
The magistrate of the city this morning advises on a template of traffic Councillor Stefan Majer (Green).
Accordingly, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
But that are not raised prices, but the time interval from parking meters and ticket machines to be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December must then decide nor the city council.
The Retail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce holds the "not a good idea."
The parking directly outside the shop was "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers."
The Traffic Club Germany is of the opinion that an increase after two decades "entirely appropriate and actually long overdue" is.
Public transport will also be more expensive.

Oil prices are further up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price has also continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry China's manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil for delivery in December fell to $ 96.24 a barrel at late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange up 14 cents.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large crude oil supply has impacted prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday the U.S. offer has increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer was increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of stronger demand by two reports of a growing activity in the Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached its lowest level in the previous quarter for the past two decades.
Crude oil from the Brent, a benchmark of international crude oil, which is also used by U.S. refineries, fell on the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to $ 108.58 per barrel.

The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood well, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the front passenger and rear seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Sure, for one or the other cocktail or champagne may be responsible!
What could be better than chilling the next Drive-In to go to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit, I'm happy with it, if it late at night or very early in the morning goes to fast food overtaking.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then off you go home and go to bed!
But on the way home to make the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers felt.
For what must be one missing that one throws his fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?
Lie mainly on the weekends discarded paper bags on roadsides and in parking lots.
"Why?", I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags with, respectively, home to the nearest trash?
It's not just that the paper stuff littered the landscape.
Bags have already covered transport facilities such as guard rails and triggered accidents.
About something thinks said "throwaway society" but not after, probably do not even know what this word means actually.
If you are often on the road at night, especially with several people in the car, you know how a back seat after they partied through the night might look like: clothes, bottles and other trash piled since.
There were a few bags but also account for more or less nothing - as opposed to the street, where no one wants to trample on the leftovers of others.
I see already come the day on which the cities and towns, the clearing away is too stupid - and must demand the fast-food chains for their bags pledge.

A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the crumbling highway system, and believe the solution we have found, is housed in the dashboard of each car in a little black box.
The devices that record every kilometer and report the information to the authorities, are core point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system of financing of U.S. roads.
This usually rather boring field of road design has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and speak out in favor of the government, the small boxes to record the number of kilometers - and possibly where they were driven - use and the information can then be used for the calculation of tax assessments.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while you can not agree on an approach in Congress, several states do not wait any longer.
You currently consider how they can change to a system over the next ten years to pay for the drivers per mile driven.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachograph, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This really is a must for our country.
"There is nothing that we will only be able to use," said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of Southern California Assn. Governments of planning a record of miles driven in all California motorists in the state from 2025.
The way how we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The move comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by Americans at the pump is broke.
But in America not so much fueled as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians dare not at high fuel prices, the tax to raise even one cent.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently 500 cars equipped with tachographs, with which a miles-based payment system to be tested.
"This is the most sensible long-term alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea in urban liberals will appeal, because the tax could be used for example to influence the driving behavior so that congestion and greenhouse gases are reduced.
The California planners rely on the system in the development of strategies by which the ambitious statutory goals of the state should be reached on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he is the most viable see long-term alternative.
Even the free marketers of the Reason Foundation are pleased with the idea to let drivers pay by the distance traveled.
"This is not a tax, which disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for policy at Reason.
The people pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had asked the Congress in a report in 2011 to move towards mile based charging.
The U.S. Senate approved last year a $ 90 million expensive pilot project, which would have covered 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House prevented the advance and responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on the way to work or in the city in everyday life.
Several states and cities do not move nevertheless on your own in this direction.
On most committed is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the biggest experiment in the country.
These drivers will pay to the State soon the miles charges instead of mineral oil.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such.
Illinois testing to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, to which the transport ministries include 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are researching how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were fitted with the devices, drivers were skeptical at the thought that the government could track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and earnings management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the test started off, the ACLU warned of Nevada on their website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph in adult monitoring devices."
There was no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that now hold out for affordable technology with which the state can collect the mileage, but not exactly when and where.
With that said, Khan, and the public would be killed.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The Company is not originally occur to help states in the taxation of motorists.
Rather, their goal was to break into an emerging market for car insurance foot, where drivers are supposed to pay on the basis of miles driven.
But the devices are tested by their interest to the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs big mistakes were made.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with it, to give motorists a series of choices.
You can opt for a unit with or without GPS.
Or they do not select a device and instead pay a flat fee based on the average driven by all the inhabitants of the State of miles.
Other sites are hoping to sell the concept of a suspicious public, by equipping the device with more features than with fewer.
In New York City traffic officials want to develop a device on taxation, which also have to pay for parking, insurance must be paid for mileage and speed data from other vehicles in real time are collected, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion.
"Motorists would be motivated by the added value of the benefits that the system offers to participate," it says in a planning document of the city.
Some transportation planners wonder, however, whether all the talk about the Pay per mile is not just a giant red herring.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of the San Francisco Bay told officials that Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual fee could be drivers of hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use less gasoline, imposed, so that they pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation when an aspirin is also sufficient," said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists do worry about their privacy, and numerous other things.

Bad Durrheim-: A dream come true for the FC
On the importance for the city and the football club's official opening ceremony for the artificial turf sports field lost despite the cold weather and the rain of anything.
A pleasant ceremony had probably all wanted last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play here.
So all those out in the cold that came without an umbrella or such a could not hold for some reason.
That was the musicians who framed the ceremony, just as so many speakers.
Therefore wet was also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
He thanked especially Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been heavily involved for the implementation of the project, the local council, the parties and club members, who brought up.
Here especially Lothar hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioner laid 400 square paving stones of the new routes.
This remarkable volunteer work also paid tribute to the member of parliament Charles Rombach.
More Greetings were for urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Frederick Knorr from the planning office, which announced a donation for the youth section of the club.
Mayor Klumpp brought to mind that recurring effects of weather in spring and autumn the original pitch so afflict that he could not be recorded.
15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem, as has been thought of to build a third place at the site of the football clubs or at the Realschule at Salinensee.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, thoughts came to the application of an artificial turf sports field, which was generally considered as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken two years ago when the FC took over the Schabel exchange at long lease, promised a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
The council decided in October 2012, the acquisition of the remaining 356 000 EUR in the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp concluded.
Construction of 68 times 108 meter artificial turf took place on 4 June.
During the three-month-long construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the application of a dirt bike track.

Snowden willing to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service has stated that he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German Bundestag, when the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander not provide answers about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele Snowden met on Thursday in Russia, where it has received asylum in order to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter of Snowden, who was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday from Ströbele, writes this: "Even if the result of my efforts was proven to have positive, my government treats dissent continues as unfaithful and attempts to criminalize political expression with criminal threat at which no defense is possible. "
But to tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government from drop the charges against him.
The charges levied by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk with German officials, then we find ways to make it work."
The relations between the U.S. and Germany are affected by the allegations that NSA had intercepted the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy, who heads the responsible for the secret parliamentary committee, said that one should take the opportunity to Snowden to listen as a witness, if this was possible, "without endangering him and ruining relations with the United States entirely."
Ströbele, a representative of the Green, published a picture of yourself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia when he was leaving the country.
When Snowden informative in Germany, then he needed an assurance that he is "safe" is there, so the deputy.
Snowden explains in his letter that he saw himself exposed to a "serious and ongoing" campaign of persecution have driven him from his home.
He was, however, affected by the global response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians - even in the United States - have called the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a credit for the general public.
In his letter Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, "if the difficulties were solved about the humanitarian situation."

Safety concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential people
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the Statue of Samora Machel, the country's founder and first president of Mozambique to agree peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of the country they swapped their business attire against a T-shirt saying "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there are almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement initially ruled by the White Rhodesia and later apartheid government of South Africa was supported in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back again into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast growing economy, much is at stake, since the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camp in the north-west could be in the next few years investments of over 50 billion U.S. dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko bring from the U.S. into the country.
The ruling Frelimo Party, since 1975, the dominating force, Renamo and give each other the blame for the tensions.
Renamo claimed that the government had the recent clashes provoked by 17 October had its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo attacked.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamo spokesperson told the Financial Times.
The government gives Renamo the blame for the violence and accused the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Compared to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama consider oneself as a "loser" who "wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can the government impose its decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying, Renamo give the peace agreement of 1992.
Compared to the FT, he stated that he may have meant that Frelimo not respect the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and that seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions that were sparked by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), the heads come together," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial incentives from the government.
Renamo electoral successes shrink since 1992, during a recent party, which is likely to improve in the elections, founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM).
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is pending when his second term ends next year - would destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he did not want to give up the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear on what capacities Renamo has, but it has taken disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connections.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, Beira is located in the but, the port, use the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale on the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted for a month to use the railway, after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good," Mazanga said.
The instability was the frustration over the government further increased, says Fernando Lima, Head of Media Coop, an independent media company, because many people were worried already because of corruption, the slow progress of the development and a recent kidnapping wave.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultan, a protester, said that people just wanted stability.
"Not interested Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads," he said.

Chinese newspaper is after calling be "reformed"
A Chinese newspaper, which had called on the title page the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation should be reformed, said a press regulator.

Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports of the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized," admitted the regulator in a statement.

In addition, we have "the Yangcheng Evening News Group instructed to carry out a complete rectification of the new Express and recommended to determine the relevant person in charge at the new Express and immediately to check the leadership team of the new Express."
Chen had several articles for the new Express written, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case I Zoomlion damaged as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the confidence of the public," he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was out of money and fame.
I realized that I had acted wrongly.
Following Chen's apology from the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that they had failed to review the reports correctly.
Various known suspects have passed recently televised confessions.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a change in the law earlier this year in which the authorities were forbidden to force anyone to blame themselves.

In such attacks, the target site is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and collapses the site.
The cyber tactics is relatively simple and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.

Children should get taught as "role models for life" myths and legends, says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brute force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthurian legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland for a "careful selection" age-appropriate works pleaded.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore already part of education," he said.
I have suggested as a plan for twenty years.
He added, with authors and teachers who "overly didactic" were, children would "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories would the messages "subliminal" conveys.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales is stated: "One can trace certain intentions, but you should keep them as possible in the background."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented subliminally, are revealed through the story and not explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of telling.

The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book before and they reported on Thursday night that the Topberater the President had "large group meetings and surveys the end of 2011" was carried out to find out whether it look better waning for Obama's hopes for re-election if he fall Biden leave.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book features thoroughly the history of the efforts of key personnel of the campaign and the White House after, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to measure what effect it had on the survey results, the to replace former Secretary Clinton against the Vice President.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest advisers of the President - including Daley, former Obama Campaign Manager Jim Messina, and the former senior White House adviser, David Axelrod, David Plouffe and - knew about the envisaged change it.
In "Double Down" is said Daley had been at the forefront of efforts to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship" before you finally decided against such a move, after data showed that the candidacy of Clinton's "chances Obama "would not significantly improve.
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I expressed a number of things that you should consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.

Council is pleased with sound fiscal
Whenever it comes to the budget in council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schoenach is well stocked and debt since 2005, knows the administration already no longer.
Also the financial year 2012 can be accounted for in this sense a complete success.
This became clear during the presentation of the financial statements for 2012.
How Rothmund Andrea explained that the operating budget is approximately 7.6 million euro failed over a million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget lies with approximately 1.8 million euros, some one million euros over the neck.
Due to the excess is especially the higher business taxes and the community share of the income tax.
Also the capital budget was significantly higher than the planned values​​.
Instead of the expected 1.5 million euros it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher supply from the administrative budget," Roth mouth.
Since less investment has been made as planned in the 2012 budget year, the reserve supply is higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"Such a work can not shake easy to come by," Gerster praised in view of the financial statements.
He and the local councils were visibly pleased with the excellent figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but exactly these good numbers could citizens soon dearly.
Due to the good financial position, the municipality in the past did not require high collection rates.
This in turn grants but had been reduced by the state, according to Gerster has often.
For these grants from various balancing sticks, there are conditions.
Under this, the cities and municipalities applying for grants, met certain assessment rates.
"The issue of assessment rates, we need to look at, because in the coming years investments are pending, for which we would like to grants," Gerster announced in this context.

Cry of despair a Obama voter
I have President Obama elected twice in the hope that change is possible
He says that Obama has made ​​commendable efforts have been thwarted by the blockade tactics of the Republicans
The blockade policy apologize not the site problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 elections were a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a sophomore at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book of which I have thought it would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope.
It is said (to win courage) "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election.
When I am finished the evening with my patients transcripts and go to bed, then takes me the book back into a time when the policy inspired millions and could talk a take your breath away.
The election was a landslide victory and newscaster paused to lead the historic significance of this moment in mind.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on his way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
As time 2008 Obama moved into office, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Again, switch to the present is a rude awakening, as if one is torn from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I made the first time my voice has actually changed something.
But it's just not anything I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has reached, by the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the Army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I am also of the view that the party political blockade tactics have tilted too many aspirations, with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, just to name a few.
But after the Obama administration I defended towards colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have arrived with my attempts at explanation at the end.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican blockade policy can not explain why one allows listening to foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It can not explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished who disclose government wrongdoing.
It can not explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, or why public financing and spending limits are bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it says that the efforts of the White House for the immobilization of the media are "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration."
And jüngstens it can not excuse the inability in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act to design a simple website.
I do not know if it is what I should have expected.
Had I 18 should understand that the government's work would run counter to their previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the deputies Office is not a predictable rate, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre influence the public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, then they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and half-baked alternative, he did not seem to be able to set its direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections would fulfill the hope of which we had heard so long.
However, with the decline in the approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week to return to the year 2008, this book has become the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a passage in the book describes how Obama had to put in the primaries in Pennsylvania a heavy loss against Clinton.
In a meeting with the election workers after deciding he told his employees that they have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remind ourselves who we are.
There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.

In Pfullendorf the current is more expensive
Citizens Pfullendorfs have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne bias against the SÜDKURIER confirmed, come to 70 to 90 Euro extra costs per year to a four-member family Pfullendorfer.

Josef Winkler writes for more than 30 years the hardships of his childhood and youth of the soul.
The disasters of his Catholic childhood village - the silence, the penchant for brute force and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and lack of pleasure - has the Carinthian poet described many times.
The Büchner Prize winner is best known as a prose writer, theater texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prose Gerhard Fresacher designed for his performance of "lightning on the tip of the tongue" which is now on display in the garage X at St. Peter's Square, so a collage of prose together.
The theater-makers about connecting elements from the autobiographical novel "The serf" (1987) with prose miniatures from "corpse, his family belauernd" (2003).
On the largely emptied stage - important requisite: a crumpled bed, is suggestively copulating and masturbating on the - the eight-member ensemble lurches through the text material.
This director Fresacher seems to trust the little text.
The 70-minute performance glossed over the template with a plethora of directing ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come off at the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic transformations.
They are grabbed me hard, dipped his head under water, stapled with their evening gowns on the wall.
Wedged in cellophane or bodice, they teeter dangerously high heeled through the staging, either they monologues loudly or are completely silent on the stage floor.
The text hardly conveys to these strained, however.
The best moments of the evening has when it is sung - the spectrum ranges from deep purple to include folk songs.
Only towards the end of the performance turned over something comes to rest, and Winkler's nigh absurd humor flashes.
