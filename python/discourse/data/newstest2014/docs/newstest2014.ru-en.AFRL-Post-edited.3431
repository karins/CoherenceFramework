Germany is the first in Europe to allow "uncertain gender" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe, where "uncertain" will be allowed in the registration of children born with unclear gender, instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will be allowed to leave the gender "uncertain" in the birth certificate registry.
Instead of "f" (female gender) or "m" (male gender), parents can initially record "x" (uncertain gender).
This decision is aimed to not push parents to hurry with gender clarification surgery.
According to the statistics, one in 2,000 babies in the world is born with unclear gender.

Anger over the verdict of one organizer of the Bali terrorist attack
The remaining survivors and relatives of 202 victims of the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict of Umar Patek, the last of the conspirators to appear in court, and stated that he should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in south-east Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building the explosive devices used in the attack.
He could be freed within 15 years, if he gets parole.
The 45th defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of attacks on two night club in the popular tourist area of kuta, during which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty on a number of other charges related to terrorism, including in a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have suggested life imprisonment, although they could request that the man, nicknamed "the master bomb-maker" for his reputation for making explosives, should be sentenced to death.
This decision evokes painful memories for June Kortin, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old daughters Jane and Jenny in the terrorist attack, almost ten years ago.
Barely concealing her own tears, she said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
"I really believe that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad, "the AAP quoted Ms. Kortin.
"I have to live every day knowing that I will never have grandchildren and I will never see my daughters."
The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device, left in a van parked outside, detonated just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the "Paddy" bar, where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack, with a ton of explosives, only 20 seconds earlier.
After that attack, he fell into a month-long coma and "died" three times, while connected to a life-support system.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell of "Jemaah Islamiyah", responsible for the bloodbath, along with Amrozi, Mukhlasa and Imam Samudry who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty all the more.
To save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.
To get 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last of the terrorist attack in Bali, to appear before a court of law.
He was hiding for almost a decade, but in the end was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda boss Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that the intelligence indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to restore the ties between southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Kortin.
Until recently he regretted nothing about how much grief he caused others.
The judgement came in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"This year there will be a lot of tears," said Ms. Kortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.

Chicago goalie Nikolai Khabibulin stressed that he understands that he has to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings, Hawks' goalie Khabibulin missed six goals against Tampa Bay and then four against Ottawa; in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed goal.
We need to play well, and in the last two games for me this failed - began CSN Chicago's Khabibulin.
I have to find confidence in training, maybe, for me to approach the games and try to achieve the best result.
You need to examine your past games and work on those weaknesses there.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel reasonably well.
But for some reason, after several goal it all turned into a snowball.
Perhaps I have to relax a bit.
Goalkeepers - I think, including me - are always trying to make the perfect play.
If I miss four, five, six, I am not enthusiastic.
No matter what happens in front of my goal.
I still work on myself, not to miss so many goals.
It's cool that they support me, but the simple fact: I must play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to spend it much better.
But what happened, happened.
I have to put it aside.
I will try to play better next match.

Energy Dnepropetrov has launched a unique program to rescue... nests storks
In olden times to accomodate storks, villagers installed cart wheels on high posts, which supported the heavy nests.
Instead of such special poles, however, storks have chosen transmission line posts, interlacing branches rest on the wires, making Aistin's house safe.
Grandmother Anne, who has lived near the Aistin family house in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsk district for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles, despite the best efforts of its inhabitants.
As the birds put new branches on top, the lower layer, which has already fallen between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course each year at the Metochion Gnezdilis, a family of storks lay and hatch three or four chicks each summer, but don't want to remain without light.
Once the birds departed for warm regions, grandmother Anne called the Tsarychanka Depn, which owns the posts.
She did not expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovk, they were surprised that nest in general still holds, said technical director Sergei Berezovsky.
The wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, which weighed 150 - 200 kilograms, had began to corrode.
At any moment the birds could die from electrical discharge.
Yes, local people risked losing power due to damage to the wires.
However line workers began the operation to rescue the nests, and not for the first time in their careers.
They were helped by ornithologists from Dnepropetrovsk National University, who have developed a scheme of transferring the nests.
They also held training sessions for the employees of regional networks.
Famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power companies at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
Estimates show that more than 50 nests in that area are in an awful state.
Special metal platforms, reminiscent of a funnel, were created for the renovation.
The branches were then moved from the old nest.
According to experts, the old branches are enough to lay a foundation for the returning birds to nest.
Then the storks arrived at his house.
The first nest was reconstructed a month ago in the village of Gerbil in the Novomoskovsk district.
Local electrical workers built a new reinforced concrete pole and placed the existing nest on the platform.
The whole operation cost power producers around nine thousand rubles.
And the other day a housewarming party was held in the village of Ivanovk in the Petrikovsk district at the house of grandmother Ani.
Here the platform secured to the same place, only without the wires.
Ornithologists are not sure the cautious, conservative birds even noticed that their spring "apartment" was overhauled.
Before the end of the year they expect to move another four nests in the Tsarichansk and Dnepropetrovshk designated protection areas.
By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others have ruthlessly killed them.
Sad area news the other day - in the village of Ust-kamenka in the Apostolovsk district, on the opening day of the hunting pheasants, for entertainment, poachers shot a family other birds at a local pond.
The noble birds are not afraid of people - locals fed them and did not abuse them.
When the villagers heard the shots and rushed to the pond, four birds were already lying dead in the water.
Now members of the Apostolovsk district police are investigating who shot the birds, which are entered in the red book.

Vitaly Mutko: water cannon?
It seems to me that we have returned to 15 years ago.
The minister of sport Vitaly Mutko voiced his opinion about the unrest in the stands during the match cup's "Shinnik stadium" - "Spartacus ".
I am a supporter of that, he told organizers of sporting events: the clubs, the league, the RFU.
But we can see that they have borrowed this position.
They expect that someone would come by and demand order.
This is a very good position but not quite correct.
We need to organize supporters, clubs should invite their stewards and not let it go.
We now have developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
After it is adopted, we will end this problem.
But I still have to invite all organizers of football into the process.
I read an interview with Leonid Feduna.
The state, they say, let the law right quickly.
This feeling that it is fans "Bavaria" in Yaroslavl who arrived and arranged everything.
And we are outsiders.
But in general it is terrible to see how the podium from top brands.
And this in a country that is preparing for the world cup.
"I have a feeling that we have returned to 10-15 years ago," Mutko at said.

A lawyer with cocaine addiction who warned crime gang boss about the police investigation, is jailed
42-Year-old Basharat Ditta transferred information to crime boss Nile Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction will be revealed
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment at Liverpool Crown Court.
The prestigious lawyer who told the crime boss about major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug dependence, was jailed for three years.
42-Year-old Basharat Ditta transferred criminal boss Nile Scarborough classified information about the investigation into his activities by trafficking drugs after being threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed among criminals "Steep" lawyer, was arrested at home in 2011 after a police operation to monitor Scarborough, which he represented before the court, associated with drugs.
Officers noticed as 32-year-old Scarborough left three sachets with cocaine at the home of a lawyer in the town of Blackburn, Lancashire county while he was at the dinner of the association of lawyers with colleagues.
Investigation exposes that Ditta regularly used the class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
At that time all four suspects a police large-scale investigation into the activities of the criminal organization in the distribution of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mersyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and another 32 people were later jailed after heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and more than £200,000 in cash were seized by police during a series of raids.
42-Year-old Letniy Ditta transferred information to criminals because of fear that his cocaine dependence would be uncovered.
Today at the Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors law firm based in Blackburn, was coated in disgrace after acknowledging his guilt in two cases of intentional obstruction of justice in court proceedings in Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted possession of cocaine in one of the previous court sessions.
The revelation of the lawyer came after police activity investigating Scarborough found that he regularly spoke by phone with Ditta since February 2011.
The two detectives followed up on suspects and found, as Ditta approached the home in Blackburn and put drugs of 60 percent purity under garbage boxes for the lawyer.
Shortly after the broadcast, Scarborough repeatedly spoke with Ditta, who was at the dinner at the football stadium at Ewood park, the Blackburn Rovers F.C. team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court heard that Ditta "regularly" used cocaine, after tests found traces of the class a drug in his hair, his wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he spoke with the suspected dealer, because that he was his client, and insisted that their communication is subject to lawyer-client privilege.
During his detention Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a few credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, he also had a sample of hair taken.
In a police interview he said that along with the workplace, he had a home office, and customers came to his home on legal matters.
However, in court it became known that after major arrests, he called one of the largest participants in the drug trafficking, a number of which he previously represented in court to tell of what detectives know about them.
The prosecutor Ann Wight said: "If anyone knows that he should not violate the law, then it is an attorney in criminal cases."
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position of counsel in criminal cases because he became too close with certain customers.
Contact about which we say is not just a drug dealers, but a drug dealers that supply the drugs of their own lawyer.
Some of his conversations, of course, turn out to be valid, because he was their advocate.
However, it largely shifted the boundaries of normal relations between lawyer and client.
He headed off to the police investigation as hard as it may be to enable these individuals to continue their criminal activity.
Mr Ditta dishonoured his profession.
He became close to certain customers, in particular, Scarborough and feigned his disinterest.
Ditta admitted guilt and said: "If i was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to convey the information to Mr. Scarborough ,Ii would not wait for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting senior officer Lee Halstead of Lancashire police said: "Mr Ditta turned from counsel in criminal cases in the criminal offender, and started to buy drugs from representatives of organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the purposes of the main participants in the criminal gangs that left him to extract valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and persuade the public trust and confidence.
Mr Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
The investigation into Mr Ditta led a division of Lancashire police in a particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already secured for him the sentence on three occasions storage of cocaine, and now by the demands of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case will serve as a warning to criminals that nobody is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years after acknowledging his guilt in collusion with the purpose to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud, were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, which Ditta arranged in the form of questions and answers, he says that his dream job would be a lawyer representing clients with the death sentence in america, the perfect companion for him over dinner is Muhammad Ali, and his motivation to work is inequality.

The manufacturers of jet aircraft feud over seat width, when large orders at stake
A violent dispute between the leading manufacturers of aircraft erupted about the width of the tourist class seats on long flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai air show this month.
The dispute focuses on the dynamic of the width of the seats available to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class, whose interests are not always the centre of attention of the airlines, with the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard, which would have included the width of the seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main American rival, Boeing says it must be up to the airline.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of increasingly large versions of their long-haul aircraft, and expected potentially record orders at the November 17 – 21 event.
The layout of the rear part of the plane — especially whether it seats 9 or 10 people in a row — occupies a central place in statements about the economic performance of new projects such as the Mini-Airbus.
Boeing argues that its new 777x will be reduced to 406 people on the basis of seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed on the 10 in each row.
Airbus says that its competing version, the A350 will transport 350 people in ecomomy class on seats 18 inches wide, located on nine in a row.
Aircraft manufacturing giants often exchanged blows on technical issues with the help of professional advertising in the press.
And now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the airshow in Dubai, where the 777x, is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
Airbus recently demonstrated what may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing an advertisement depicting three people in a restaurant, side by side, titled "Would you agree to that?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Likhi.
With modern changes of diet people have gaine weight, but economy seats have not changed dramatically.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 introduced travelers to modern standards and long-distance travel abroad, the average weight of American men aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
Waist measurements of the average American male in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Health.
Airbus says that its rival is committed to the concept of the seats of the 1950s, when the average waist measurements of the traveling public were smaller.
Airbus says it ordered a study indicating that an extra inch in seat width improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputed Airbus figures on the size of seats and said that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find balance between prices and amenities.
Boing said studies show that the convenience of airline cabins depends not only on the width of the seats.
"It really comes down to providing airlines choice and the opportunity to do what they believe they need to do to succeed," said Boeing cabin specialiston Kent Kreyver.
They do not want us to be solved for them that will bring them profits.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is the race for orders for planes, worth at least in the $700 billion in the coming decades — enough to change the balance of the American and European exports.
As first reported by the Reuters agency in July, the location of the seats is what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest reactive aircraft.
Airbus, as well as Boeing, also announced 20-percent improvements in profitability at one place in their latest long-haul jet models compared with the market leader in this segment, the 365-passenger boeing 777-300ER.
The numbers claimed by Boeing are based in part on comparing 777x 10-seat rows with the 9-seat row layout of the original 777.
The win in the specific cost decreases when compared with the 10-seat row layout used currently.
"The reason why boeing makes it, is to squeeze more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared with our development," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus head of passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say the cabins with full 10-seat rows for existing 777-x indicate that many passengers prefer dense seating arrangements, which can go hand in hand with lower fares.
"Seat width of 18 inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view offer Airbus is under threat from the 777-y model," said interior cabin specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select.
Exploring the world of the jets even with blocking a roulette to check the competing plans.
While praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense cabin layouts for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seat rows, but says they still do not sell it.
Until recently, Airbus highlighted the need for additional cabin modifications offering broader aisle seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the experts say it is unlikely the appeal for the new industry standard "will soar," but it might distract attention from the wave of sales of the 777x.

The subsidies from the regional budget cover 187 settlements out of 288.

The share of grants in the budget income for 122 rural settlements exceed 50% and 83 - 100 percent funded.
In the framework of the budget funding from the regional budget is about 25 billion rubles, "said Oleynikov.
The vice-governor also noted that in three towns - Mytishch, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the volume of budget revenues were more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The incomes of rural settlements of many areas of less than 3 million rubles, "is entirely lacking".
The costs of local administrative machinery in 88 settlements in the region is over 70%, "with a lower quality of services," Oleynikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipal formations region until the end of november to consider what villages need, uniting with urban districts or changing the system of administrative management.

In addition, the Mozhaysk, Kashirsk, Solnechnogorsk, and Kolomensk districts and municipalities have outstanding requests for enlargement.
Discussion of this issue in cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
Chairman Igor Mosobldumy Bryntsalov also said that all unite in the upcoming reform plan of 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of the region.

Concern about security in Mozambique due to escalating the conflict of influential people
Under Vzirayushchey at them down the statue in Zamora, President Mashela of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo, to chant slogans about peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want a return to peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she traded a business suit for a t-shirt decorated the inscription "we demand security" in portuguese, and joined in the capital on thursday to a crowd in independence square.
Within two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo — it is one of the most violent clashes since the signing of the ceasefire, more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a rebel movement, which was driven by the first white government of Rhodesia, and then the government of the South Africa of the apartheid era in an effort to destabilize the government of an independent country.
After the armistice of 1992 it became the opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again return to full conflict, but recent events have made both foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years, from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the U.S.
The ruling party, Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party accuse each other in this tension.
The Renamo party argues that the government has become the latest instigator of attacks, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on 17 october.
The attack on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked a Renamo base and attempted to kill Afonso Dkhlakamu, the leader of the group — Renamo representative Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times newspaper.
The government blames Renamo for triggering clashes, accusing the party in an attack on soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to allay fears of instability.
Guebuza told AFP, the French information agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt fewer constraints to use "all that is left of his forces to try to prove that he can impose the government own decisions."
Meanwhile Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
But worries have grown after reports that said Mazanga refused Renamo from the peace agreement of 1992.
He told the financial times that meant Frelimo was party to the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to talks, but very seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which led to a series of clashes this year.
"This is two influential persons (Guebuza and Dkhlakama) struggling each other," said Joseph Khanlon, lecturer from Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to go on the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which tries to get electoral reform, has already announced that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted it as an attempt to pressure the Oslabevshego movement to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has decreased since 1992, while a new party - the democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former members of Renamo is expected to improve their performance in these elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza, who is to step down next year, when ends his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he did not want to transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the post of president," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what possibilities Renamo has, but they have already had devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the motorway leading from the north to the south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is just a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beyru — the port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended use of the railways for about a week after Renamo threatened an attack on the railroad.
Mazanga was straightforward when he was asked a question about whether Renamo repeat this threat.
The Renamo party wanted to warn the international community that matters in Mozambique are not very good, "said Mazanga.
Instability has added to discontent with the government, but many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recently more frequent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop independent media companies.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems," he said.
Omar Sultuan, who participated in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
"Nobody cares, neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want a renewal of the world, they want to free access to the roads," he said.

Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia so far will remain in force
Australian airlines and passengers will still need to off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing in the United States, despite the measures to mitigate the regulations relating to data devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration in the United States has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided that those will remain in "flight mode".
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers consider this decision, as American airlines to spend a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but pointed out that they are not planning to in the near future to change its procedures.
In managing the safety of civil aviation they considered this statement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight still operate in Australia.
"The safety of civil aviation currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.
This issue is regulated by rules that require air carriers to ensure the maintenance of safety at any time, and for passengers to comply with safety rules with crew member instructions.
The company Virgin, which has already discussed expansion of its onboard entertainment system with wi-fi, with civil aviation safety authorities was not opposed to changes, but said that it would follow the directions of the regulator.
"We would have welcomed the review of the safety of civil aviation question about allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think this will improve the quality of customer service now, along with the (wireless on-board entertainment system) we have on our aircraft," the spokesman said.
Qantas said it would adhere to the existing rules at the moment.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices may not be used during takeoff and landing, and we are not planning to change it soon," she said.
FAA decision applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will, of course, carefully study the FAA decision and the reasons that caused it.
For carriers in the United States the impact will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Carriers will have to prove that their airplanes have resistance to radiation from mobile devices, as well as to revise manuals, training materials, guidelines on carry-on luggage and instructions for passengers.
"After the airline will inspect and confirm safety of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, easy electronic devices such as tablets, smartphones, electronic books and at any altitude," the FAA stated.
In rare cases, poor visibility, the crew will provide instructions to passengers turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, according to the recommendations of the group, larger devices must be placed under seats or in the upper storage compartments during takeoff and landing.

Obama abandons his pledge on healthcare
In the storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday changed his often repeated, unequivocal pledge that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination of service from their providers in recent days, Republicans savaged the president for misleading the American public.
Yesterday Obama withdrew his repeated initial promise to the public.
"The majority of people who have health insurance that works, they can keep it," he said in his speech in Boston.
Touching on what he called "the animation in the news" about the termination of service, Obama called for Americans receiving these notices to seek other options on the market.
Most people will be able to get the best, comprehensive health insurance plans for the same price or even cheaper than had been forecast.
"You get more favorable terms," he said.
The administration said that no one should be surprised that the 5% of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable medical care, said that the launch of the web site has been "appallingly bad" since October.
"I was upset and disappointed like everyone," she said.
"I really want to regain your trust."
Secretary Sebelius uttered this phrase that caught the open microphone, sitting behind her assistant at the hearing yesterday in the house after heated debate with the member of the house of representatives, Billy Long, Republican from Missouri, about whether she is obliged to join the Obama healthcare program.
After more than three hours of hearings Long repeatededly asked Sebelius to say why the "architects" of the Affordable Care Act do not voluntarily renounced the government sponsored insurance plan and instead purchase insurance through healthcare.gov, which the act now imposes on millions of Americans.

Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case would be heard fairly
On Friday Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev reported that the Greenpeace activists will be reviewed in strict accordance with Russian law.
France should have no doubt doubt that the case will be conducted in compliance with the law; we hear all their concerns.
"We can guarantee adherence to the law," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with the prime minister of France Jean-Marc Hérault.
Among the detained activists Greenpeace is a citizen of France.
Pierre Pizanyu, like other activists is charged with hooliganism.
"I asked, can we expect a humanitarian gesture towards the detainee citizen" - Ria Novosti quotes Mr. Hérault.
"Our country cannot sustain activity which may cause damage to the environment, no one has the right to violate laws", - said Dmitry Medvedev in turn.
According to him, the activity of any structures that are trying to influence the technologically sophisticated and insecure processes, including energy production, is dangerous.
He stressed that these objects are "powder kegs", and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, reports Ria Novosti.

Coulson resorted to phone hacking to check the confidential messages
The former editor of the news of the world Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" when trying to confirm false information about Charles Clarke, who was at that time in the post of Minister of Internal Affairs.
Crown court prosecutor, lawyer Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World received false news that Clark met with his attractive "special" contact Khannoy Polbi.
The newspaper recruited a private investigator to hack voicemail of Glenn Mulkeyru Polbi and interviewed Podsteregala at her home, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, the court heard.
"The prosecution maintains that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is not a person who will stand beside somebody's house, hoping to find someone, he caught a man who loves history suggest to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that the newspaper News of the World had used three methods of investigation stories: the hacking of phones, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally implicated in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveilannce, he simply must.
What about the first?
Whether he knew about the hacking of phones?
He says no, we say: "oh, yes!"
Rumors about Clark first attracted the attention of the editors of the News of the World when the source, who was sexually interested in Ms. Polbi, said: "do not waste time with it, Charles."
Recordings of voice messages, obtained from her phone at least three times, was removed from the Mulkeyra's house in august 2006.
Investigators also found computer records of a private detective, in which Miss Polbi and her sister are referred to as "projects".
During the period when it was under observation, the grandmother and grandfather of Ms. Polbi received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about her, said Mr Edis.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Tyorlbek and former reporter James Uezerap controlled the monitoring of Ms. Polbi.
Leaving her a voice message on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: "I have the history that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would like to discuss with Charles."
Mr Edis said that Coulson's participation in this history followed the same pattern as with other influential people, for example with the former Minister of Internal Affairs David Blunkett.
The jury heard on thursday that Coulson entered into a confrontation with Mr Blunkett over the affair with a married woman while he himself met with editor Rebekkah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks have denied membership in a conspiracy with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkeyr, Tyorlbek and Uezerap confessed to hack phones.

In the databases of Ministry of Internal Affairs no group "Fraternal Circle", to which the U.S. links Leps
The group "Fraternal Circle" to which Washington has linked singer Gregory Leps, does not exist in the databases of the Russian security services.
As Interfax noted, after reports appeared in the media that the U.S. Treasury was adding Leps to security checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Fraternal Circle", law enforcement agencies of the Russian federation checked all databases, but the group was not identified.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad, as believed by security services.
"Even in the very title - 'Fraternal Circle', there is an element of mystery, a hint of a secret lodge.
"All this is very similar to Pier-Aktsiyu", is the agency spokesperson stated.
The U.S. treasury announced on October 31 that they have added Arthur Badalyana, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalina, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalskogo and Igor Shlykova to their checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Fraternal Circle ".
The persons listed in this list are suspected of links with Vladislav Leontevym and Gafurom Rakhimov, who are prominent members of criminal groups and have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps "serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontief".
At the next stop Gregory's producers declined to comment on the U.S. charges against the singer, calling them "delusions".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama indicated that the "Fraternal Circle" syndicate is among "substantial transnational organized criminal groups" and "asked the Ministry of Finance to investigate their global criminal operations".
The man's inclusion on U.S. Treasury blacklists entails the blocking of his assets in the U.S. and a ban on business contacts with him persons by residing in the States.

Scientists shed light on how a dog's tail is related to its mood.
Earlier research has shown that happy dogs hold their tail on the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while alarmed dogs hold their tail mainly on the left side.
But now, scientists say that other members of the dog's family may notice these subtle differences in tail position and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a Professor at Trent University, says: "it is well known that in people the left and right side of the brain are involved differently in shaping the stimulators of positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this and many other species.
He added that just like humans, in dogs the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to various tails positions of other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of the animals' heartbeat and analyzed their behavior.
Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction, and sometimes — in another
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed videos of dogs with dogs — either a natural version or a silhouette, to get rid of any of the other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct more tail left or right."
When the animals have seen that nothing in the rest of the tail expressing the dog moved to the right (from the point of view of the observed dog's tail), they were totally relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was left mainly (again from the point of view of observed dog's tail), their heartbeat increased and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that dogs deliberately communicated with each other using these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience, about what movements they should worry about, and what not to.
He says: "If there are several meetings with other dogs and holding their tail to one side is often associated with more friendly behavior, while the other side is less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of that experience."
The researchers say that these results may give owners and veterinarians a deeper understanding of emotions of the animal.
An expert in the field of behavior of dogs, John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher in the Veterinary School at Bristol University, said it was not the first study to test whether a value for dogs left and right side.
Last year a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn the head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at peaceful dog.
And in other scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Dogs often approached the Sobak robot when its tail was held to the left, not right, rather than become alarmed — the opposite of behavior towards the Italian study."
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies are not entirely susceptible to animals in films or Sobak robots as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.
"While on various mammals there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for various purposes, many details are yet to be specified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be observed, perhaps, soon we will understand why their tails sometimes heading in one direction, and sometimes — in another.

How will business be conducted between Europe and England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April, with a mandate to poll representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we ordered the biggest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK business and the EU.
The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a broad slice of business in the UK based on the size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking for opportunities for exports outside europe, paying special attention to the countries which are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spend time on a long and difficult process of complicated reform of EU institutions.
When they were asked about their opinions on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to laws on products, most business leaders believed that control over these key areas of competence should be reclaimable by Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives have stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits from being in a commercial zone of Europe — even 40 percent of large enterprises, which are the most traditionally minded of all companies, have agreed with this.
Last and most indicative — our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants Britain to change its course on contract and on relations with the EU, based on trade, not politics.
This result, which was among enterprises of all sizes including the largest business groups, shows that business insists on "meaningful change" that would bring powers back to Britain.
The stakes are high — the changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide a 16 percent shift in voting for it to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should not have any doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects the review will lead to a major shift in the balance of power back to the UK.
The best conditions for British business will become increasingly necessary as the Eurozone is on a path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and growth in the UK and, as shown by the results of our survey for business this means greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in the standards of Brussels.

Local politician in Turkey announced a hunger strike against a wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began construction of the separation wall near the town of Nusaybin in south-eastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the BDP party spoke out sharply against the construction.
The mayor is on the border with Syria in the Turkish city of Nusaybin'isha; Gekkhan announced a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syria border, reported Ria Novosti, the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) on Friday.
Police repeatedly worked to break up protest demonstrations.
The foreign minister of Turkey Muammer Guler initially denied that construction was taking place, then stated that the wall is being built to ensure border security.
"Mayor Nusaybina'isha Gekkhan, a member of the BDP, has announced a hunger strike, thus turning their protest against the construction of a wall into a deadly struggle", - said the press service of the party.
The mayor says construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other; the Kurds crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is the inhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree," quoted'isha Gekkhan party representatives.
According to the spokesman, on 7 november at Nusaybine a rally is expected to be held against the construction of the separation wall.

In Siberia, peopse should not be devoted vegans: tomatoes are no replacement for meat
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, reports a correspondent for Ria Novosti.
People who completely reject products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
They do not move here to this winter without a loss to health, and hothouse tomatoes will not compensate for that, say doctors interviewed about the new Siberian diet.
Drink a liter of milk
Strict vegetarianism becomes a way of life when abstaining not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, and eggs.
But dietologists in Novosibirsk in Siberia and other cities believe people should to adhere to the same stringent standards in nutrition for health.
Complete refusal of animal products harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for in a strictly plant based diet.
You need to include milk or eggs in your diet, "stated dietitian Marina Bogay.
She cites as an example that fish contains the essential omega-3 fatty acid.
The richest such vegetable oil is linseed.
"For a person to take in the necessary quantities, they would need to drink litres!" says a nutritionist.
Doctors are confident that residents of Siberia need to pay special attention to their food in winter.
Vegetarianism is especially questioned in this season.
Reality in winter imposes higher requirements for food.
To keep warm, you need the extra calories.
"If people keep themselves away from animal products, can lead to a calorie deficit", experts say.
Dietologist Olga Późniak agrees with this.
She adds that imported fruits and vegetables are not a solution.
It is better to eat mostly foods which are grown in the region of residence or where you were born.
The genetic code is configured for better digestion of these products.
And during the winter, people are not totally OK, your puppy and hot supchika or even something posytnee "- the doctor explains her position.
According to her, vegans do have very useful foods, such as various grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples, and frozen berries remaining in the winter.
But this is clearly not enough for nutrition.
According to gastroenterologist Claudi Vracha, organisms in Siberians have sufficient vitamin levels only from mid August to mid September.
The full transition to vegetarianism is difficult in our harsh environmental conditions, when the temperature can change 30 degrees per day and the snow is on the ground in May.
To sustain life, the body will need energy, and that, above all, fat, "the medic concludes.
Doctors say that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
As children grow up, they need a construction material, including in the form of amino acids.
But by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them an inferior diet.
Pregnant women also need high protein content, vitamins and trace elements in their diet.
"Vegans need them" - insists Bogay.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, play with the toys which he wants ".
His body is already formed, the skeleton and organs.
But children still need to eat better.
If the parents are depriving him of trace elements and amino acids, choosing for him that he will be there, it is just a violation of the rights of the child.
"Deficits of those or other substances are needed for the development of the brain and bones," she says.
All interviewed medical specialists agree on the low quality of the winter crop in greenhouses and imported fruit and vegetables.
Food brought up and grown in greenhouses contains fewer required trace elements than those (grown up) in the open ground.
"They aren't quality products" says Bogay.
Arifulina also notes that imported and hothouse vegetables and fruits are far from an ideal standard.
Sometimes the desire of the manufacturers to build larger crops damages the quality.
"Apples are brown when cut, cucumbers quickly lose quality, and tasteless tomatoes" are examples given by doctors, adding that they likely contain excessive amounts of fertilizers.
And they are not good sources of vitamins and fiber.
Vera Petruk, a candidate of agricultural sciences in the laboratory at Siberian Physical-Technical Institute of Agricultural Issues disagrees with this.
She says that with the right approach and proper observance of all standards and requirements, the cultivation of vegetables in greenhouses may succeed.
If they try to push more into a square meter, then, of course, more often plants will require mineral fertilisers.
For example, with too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes are growing quickly, but they are large and watery "- she explains, adding that the issue of quality, in the first place, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.

Russia cities struggle to move beyond polluting cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities were observed in most cities around the world in the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, attempts focused on re-inventing and expanding highways, or attempted to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
A widely known example is Singapore, which introduced strict quota increase in the number of private vehicles, and the right of their purchase is bought at auctions.
The price may exceed two to three times the price of the car.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the center of the city.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart have introduced so-called green zones, where entry is allowed only for cars with high fuel economy using a fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric cars).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, in 2012 approved a "five-year plan of clean air" costing about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As he told Kommersant the director for vehicle pollution control for the Beijing municipal environmental protection bureau, the main objective of the plan is the reduction of major air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, an increase in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (5.2 million now), as well as an increase of no more than 5% of fuel per one vehicle.
According to the agency, motor vehicles in beijing are now responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.
Among the key measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the imposition of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city measures in the "green five-year plan" are accelerated compared with the rest of the country, including transition to fuel european standards, the introduction of the local system fuel economy standands, labelling of cars, restrictions on entry of cars in the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (besides creating a financial incentive programs to replace old vehicles for hybrid or electric cars), the development of electric vehicle (including public and official), and the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Among Beijing automotive innovations includes applying a ban on the movement of all private cars within the fifth transport ring (there are six in the capital) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the signs for vehicles), as well as the issue of registration plates for vehicles on the basis of lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).
According to the state programme "Environmental Protection for the years 2012-2020", the number of towns with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (in 2012, there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Environment in 2011 "mobile sources" dropped to 41% of all emissions of pollutants in the atmosphere of the city.
An Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are the ten times larger from industrial sources, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
The Russian Federation only recently started thinking about the possibilities of restricted regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The director of the Institute of Transport Economy and Transport Policy for the HSE, Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car travel is obviously unpopular, they can be taken only by assuming their complete versatility.
In the case of Moscow is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two groups weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts - service and personal cars, as well as vehicles "preferred" users, the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand. (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow).
The Urban Economy Center in St. Petersburg prepared yesterday's study, which analyzed the balance between urban areas and residential development covering road surface and the number of vehicles.
The key findings of researchers: two times less city centre roads are required, but most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time on car parks or simply on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build a parking and rental facility, rather than expand roads, and reduce parts of roads (in order for the streets became more friendly for pedestrians), as well as limit the use and placement of personal transport within the conservation area of historic centre (common ground around 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).

A trip on the dirt, the rivers and the jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Belle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Belle and his team spend nearly every weekend, taking hundreds of patients
In this African country there are not so many doctors — just one in 5,000 people
Cast your vote here, or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Belle — one of the top 10 CNN heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other top 10 CNN heroes, so he becomes a hero of the year.
This man receives $250,000 to continue his remarkable work.
For 21 years, Georges Belle saw his father come back to life and again sink into unconsciousness, wandering across hospitals, which were not properly equipped to help him.
Dzhamef Belle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken hand but the contagion spread to the brain and caused an infection, which affected him to the end of his life.
"Cameroon had no neurosurgeons," said Georges Belle.
If we had the money, we would have flown him out from Cameroon.
Instead, Belle years accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals receiving any treatment that they could get.
"It is not easy," said Belle.
— You can leave from your house at 5 a.m. to run back to the hospital to be first, but you are not the first.
So many patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation is not much changed since Belle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in cameroon there is only one doctor per 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States — one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could go to a doctor, many of them could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health expenditures in it are private.
"Their only problem is poverty," said Belle.
— And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their lives. "
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Belle became determined to do something with this.
Last year, Dr Georges Belle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations.
He became a doctor and vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his band of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and another 30 people drive in vans with medical supplies chained to their roofs and travel over rough terrain to visit villages in need of help.
They do not always have luck.
More than once they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as the true heroes: their arrival becomes a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms local residents can provide.
Free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration, and Belle with his broad smile and infinite energy is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning the team starts to take hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 people on each trip," said Belle.
They come from the whole vicinity within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people get treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, disease, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive donated crutches points or free birth certificates - documents needed for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually held in a school or municipal building, or in a house; after the procedure, patients come and go in the operation area to make space for the next person.
Using a generator to provide lighting operating and sanitization equipment Belle and its volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.
This determination sets a frantic pace, but teams of rural musicians usually help.
"They all night beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work," said Belle.
On Sunday, the brigade members are sent back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonians, foreign doctors and medical students, performed 700 free operations last year, and they know that their aid could be of great value for those they help.
One man explained that he obtained free surgery for the hernia treatment will allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinics and his work as a hospital surgeon Belle also works nights in a private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second work, he said, that provides 60% of the funding for his a nonprofit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he sleeps," said Cathy O'Mally, a second year medical student from Dreksel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Belle's group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization to continue with these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as about O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Belle in implementing his objectives, it is an opportunity to practice which they would never have got at home.
"We have got to assist on operations, where we helped remove the blood stains or keep the tools for doctors Belle", — said about O'Malley.
Being a nursing student, you would never get this kind of opportunity in America.
Student volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with medicines.
But on arrival in Yaounde Bell pays for their meals, transport and education.
"He is a hero, without a doubt," said about O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organisation, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is infinite.
For Belle the almost constant work load is not an ordeal.
Helping others to live a happy life, to fulfil this promise to his father — that is what brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when i do this job," said Belle.
— And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

The "Russian mafia" in the United States a new name finally takes hold - "Fraternal Circle"
This week in America new "Russian mafia" new names and four companies were added to blacklists.
The US Treasury has designated three representatives from Russia, Uzbekistan and two Israeli citizens members of "Fraternal Circle".
One of the Russians was singer Gregory Leps, whom the U.S. suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
In all, the United States lists 22 people as linked to "Fraternal Circle" and six organizations affiliated with it.
Nevertheless, many experts have expressed doubt that such an organization exists.
"The name 'Fraternal Circle' is more like an attempt to unite the disparate criminal gangs," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and professor at New York University.
In his opinion, "Fraternal Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".
"I had yet to see anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would have confirmed the existence of such criminal organizations," said Mr Galeotti, of the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Liz Shelley, a professor at George Mason University agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they act together, then it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," her words echoing those from the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that "Fraternal Circle" unites in more closely with Russian thief Aslan Usoyana, known as Ded Hasan.
The criminal authority was assassinated in January of this year.
So, activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zacharias Kalashova, blacklisted in 2012, were closely connected to Ded Hassan, and another participant on the list, Temuri Mirzoyev, celebrated Ded Hasan's nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr Galeotti notes that some people on the list have no relationship to Usoyanu.
In his opinion, all of them feature more common financial and criminal interests, such as the delivery of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps - the beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - in "Fraternal Circle" attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we hope that we get more detailed information from our American colleagues, in connection with how the decision was made and why he was included in such lists, said a spokesman for the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian federation, its interests would be protected.

Tony Blair said that he would take advantage of the chance to return as Prime Minister of Great Britain, but concedes that he is unlikely to return.
In an interview on the eve of the evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his retirement in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a special peace envoy in the middle east.
Answering the question of whether he would have returned to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but this is unlikely to happen, so..."

Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the outcome of a draw in the 10th round match of the Italian cup with "Lazio".
The expert also noted their failure at the start due to a series of injuries to leading players.
I am very sorry that we have not managed to win, said Allegri of TMW.
The team has played a match, creating three or four good opportunities.
In the first half we allowed nothing against "Lazio".
In the second the Romans increased their score, but in general I can't say that we lost concentration.
It was necessary to win.
Last season we fulfilled the task of getting into the champions league.
Now we lag behind the schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries of key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players with character.
However our members and now are good.
Look at Kaka, who held a meeting at the highest level.

The British police present Assange extradition notice
British police today handed a notice of extradition for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange who took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said they handed the 40-year-old Australian an "official requirement to surrender" with the requirement to report to the police station, adding that as part of this requirement, he will then be subject to arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes after he exhausted his opportunities in accordance with British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm will transfer him to the United States, on June 19, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London asking the South American country for asylum.
"Scotland Yard handed the 40-year-old man an official requirement to surrender, which obliges him to come to the police station at a date and time of our choosing," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the notice of the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the US, to charge him with possible charges of espionage after the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website Wikileaks.

Now the Roman Senchin is located in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Eltyshevy", the other on the French language.
Recall that his novel was a finalist for four prizes: "Yasnaya Polyana", "Russian booker prize", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year, the writer of this book was awarded the prize of the government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin - clearly the leader in the current generation thirty-year and no language prose writers.
Virtually every publication of his hard, built on a modern material life stories and legends are heated debate among critics of the most different directions.
It is possible to assert, that collected together articles about the prose and journalism of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publishing creates a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the beginning of the 2010s.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial modern writers", according to critic Sergey Chuprinina, it mostly is about how its participants understand the word "literature", see what the present and future not only of our literature but also of life.
Unfortunately, the books are not allowed to include most of the articles and reviews of the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical articles and reviews are, as a rule, in cutting sections of paragraphs in "..."

Snowden can answer questions in Russia
American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, most likely will not have to travel outside Russia to testify in cases of tapped telephone conversations of German chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation said the American might answer questions from representatives of Germany in writing or other means in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he will lose the status of a refugee and could be extradited to the United States according to Washington's request", the agency spokesman said.
"However, in principle, the prosecutor general of the Federal Republic of Germany could send their representatives to Russia or submit written questions to Snowden", the source said, adding that this question should be elaborated on the international level.
Earlier, a member of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Schtrebele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the trial about phone tapping by American spy agencies of negotiation of the chancellor of Germany.
Snowden was ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow, or in the territory of Germany.
The CIA contractor made clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the American NSA blocked his travel, Snowden was ready to come to Germany.
But for this we have to clearly define the conditions of his arrival, "Schtrebele said to the Euronews TV channel.
Snowden lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, said his client would cooperate with German investigators, but will decide himself when and how.
US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA in the US, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, then leaked information about secret U.S. intelligence operations on internet surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by US authorities in absentia, pending serious accusations against him, and prior to the beginning of August remained in the transit zone of the Sheremetyevo airport.
On 1 August Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year, and on the same day he left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said his client took a job at "a major Russian company".
German media reported last week about NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, Americans began to listen to the phone calls of the chancellor back in 2002.
A listening device was allegedly at the U.S. embassy in Berlin.
After the publication of these data German authorities indicated that the surveillance of Merkel violates laws and German sovereignty.

Children must study myths and legends as "life models," the author says.
Tales of the Torah could show that "brute force cannot defeat the subtle trick", and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many of the myths are "too wild, too scary and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools," Krossli-Holland stands for "carefully selecting" age appropriate texts.
"I think it is wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have advocated the introduction into educational programs for twenty years.
He added that the "excessive moralization" authors and teachers from "interest" in children, and the basic ideas in a fascinating history.
Krossli-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote "a collection of norwegian myths" and the british folk tales for Penguin Publishers said: "you can of course be the intention, but you better keep them with him."
Perhaps the biggest difference between writing for adults and writing for children, is the need to feel some kind of hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary to have an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be clear; unfolded through history and not clearly formulated.
The old principle: to show, not tell.

Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the fragile driver of economic growth in Russia, consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of arrears on unsecured consumer loans and mass layoffs of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.
Lately, it is almost entirely due to consumption, which does not ease turnovers ", said Clemens Column, Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia, presenting yesterday's overall quarterly report on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation at 6 percent, it will be able to meet future consumer demand roughly at the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, however, most likely, they will improve the expenditure on staff.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are rising by 10 per cent, while GDP is only 2%, explained Mr. Column.
The company experienced a decline in profitability.
If it does not rise, it could lead to lay-offs and a rise in unemployment.
Russian businesses cannot raise salaries, said Barclays capital chief economist for Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
With unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
To lure away or keep employees employers must raise wages.
Consumption in Russia and very rapid growth.
According to Mr. Fields, because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans this kind of lending does not have a multiplying effect on the economy of the country.
The benefit to the economy from growing we saw no, the money does not go to the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments, said economist.
But the problem in another - at Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on unsecured credit.
They are mostly not rich, and have nothing to offer as security.
Interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they often do not return, "said Mr. Column.
However the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of arrears on unsecured credit.
The director of the HSE banking institute Vasily Solodkov now sees signs of growing banking crisis.
Small credit organizations without access to cheap resources, which traditional banks have, were forced to raise funds for the population through high interest rates.
In response, traditional banks went on the war-path and began to lower lending rates, says the economist.
Small credit organizations cannot give loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margin.
If traditional banks do not abandon dumping, Russia is in a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The economist believes that the revocation of the licences of several banks in recent weeks is a harbinger of collapse.
"By themselves traditional banks can't cope with such a situation: the system of deposit insurance was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," warns head of the institute.
But consumption growth will slow and without the crisis of non-payments, believe in the prestigious - because of the refusal of indexing salaries for civil servants and the military, which in the current version of the draft budget.
Partially hit consumption will be softened by the freeze tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, reduced inflation).
But only partly: if investments do not rise (and the prerequisites for this are not yet - see the certificate), consumption growth still slows, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital is waiting until he sees the prerequisites for implementation of the pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still falling oil prices, he says.
In his estimation, the Russian economy will shrink when the cost of oil falls below $90 per barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank cannot cut interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation fell, and banks have been raising rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the central bank, transitions its target interest rate for inflation ", said Clemens Column.
The policy of the central bank on market rates affects not only the interbank lending rates.
"Hopes for the central bank all collapse," praised Clemens Column.
The money received by the central bank auctions, banks are not lending to the economy, and to manage its liquidity
As soon as the reduced rate, just changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later, the central bank will understand that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Column and reminded that the state plans to ruble float by the end of 2015.
But will either have to do this before, or pick up a key central bank rate (5.5%), he says.
In his estimation, the ruble is artificially overvalued by 10%.
Ruble only one road is weakening, - the expert concludes.
But if the central bank in financial system even the shadow of a doubt that the currency is not part of the policy to weaken the currency, it can bring down the ruble is much stronger.

The meeting could take place either in Moscow, or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Kristian Schtrebele - that he knows very much.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his travel, Snowden was ready to come to Germany.
But first we will need to clearly define the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding the U.S. spy programs.
The Senate committee on intelligence approved a bill yesterday, providing additional restrictions on the activities of the American intelligence agencies online.

FAA: "Air passengers can now use the gadgets on planes (but not to call from your mobile phone)"
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines, published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect change to occur immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
FAA has indicated that airlines will have to show how their planes meet the new guidelines and that they must update their training manuals for members of the flight crew and the rules on the installation of devices to conform to the new guidelines.
FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines which have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the condition of the plan we could approve the increased use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA stated.
Passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain indicates that it is safe to do so.
Passengers should turn off their devices once again when the plane is descends for landing, and not to use them while the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and runway taxi, FAA said.
Most new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers could use wi-fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleyding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the change.
"After the new policy is safely implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carriers to achieve this), it will be a win-win option," said Gleyding.
We frankly are tired of feeling like "cranky schoolteachers" when it comes to this issue.
But using the internet connection for web browsing, exchange of electronic mail, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, still no "Words with Friends" — the social game which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a notable case: the actor was ejected from an American airlines flight for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the aircraft was at the gate.
But heavier devices, such as laptops, still need to be stored in the overhead storage compartment because they could injure someone if they were to fly through the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones in flight are still banned.
Regulatory powers on telephone falls under the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may remove a ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month Mark Rozenker from the National Council for Transport Safety, the national transport safety expert for CBS news, said that cell phones are still considered a safety risk.
"Cell phones — it really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we know thanks to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers is when the plane is in the air," said Rozenker.
An FAA advisory committee created to study this issue, recommended last month that the government allowed the more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has grown on the FAA, with the aim of easing restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Democrats Senator from Missouri Claire McCaskill, argue that there is no legitimate reason for the prohibitions related to safety.
The restrictions also becomes more difficult to enforce, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off devices.
The FAA restricted passenger use of electronic devices in 1966, in response to reports of pocket navigation and communications equipment, when some passengers began to wear a FM radio — high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they also developed and are approved by FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have already offered passengers the use of wifi at cruising altitude for several years.
The aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of aircraft adapted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals with much lower power than previous generation devices.
Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals when turning pages.
But signals become more powerful when the device downloads or sends data.
Among those who pushed for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices of passengers was the company Amazon.com.
In 2011 company representatives acquired an airliner to check for problems when using their Kindle devices for reading electronic books, but never found any.
FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices presents any risk.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Passengers said he believes distractions from the devices are real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages pilots, confirming that the devices might be creating interference for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA require pilots be allowed to require passengers to turn off devices during landings and in limited visibility.
A group of representatives from the tourism industry welcomed the changes, calling them are a step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not inconsistent with safety and protection," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. travel association.

Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to implement information provocation against senior officials of Lithuania and the countries of the eastern partnership is such a statement the agency BNS done in department of defense of the republic (DGB).
The information was published on the portal DELFI.
According to the report, in particular the Moscow intends to "book" Lithuanian president Dalyu Grybauskaite and publish fraudulent documents, allegedly found in Russian state archives, which concern facts from the biographies of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the security services, the preparation of the information attack was led by the Department of Public Management Processes of the administration of the Russian president on regionalism and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov formerly of Lithuania, who participated in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Smirnov, also a member of the operation, is ostensibly an employee in the department.
According to the intelligence agency, until the end of 2012 under the guise of a scientific work, Smirnov regularly travelled to Lithuania and met with local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the territory of the country.
On the eve of the disclosures Lithuanian President Grybauskaite has said what she knows about the upcoming information.
In her opinion, the main causes are a successful Lithuanian presidency of the Council of the European Union countries and a "desire for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader previously has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So, she stated that the Kremlin "are insufficiently respectful" to Lithuania.
In addition, Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of meddling Lithuanian affairs.
Recall that in september Rospotrebnadzor suspended imports of Lithuanian "molochki" in Russia.
It was reported that the products do not conform to epidemiological sanitary norms.
Then the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia did not lift the ban, the government of the country must prepare an appeal to the WTO.

New anti-nicotine vaccine may inhibit the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which could deprive the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before trials on humans, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are encouraging.
"We very much hope that this strategy of using vaccines can finally help the millions of smokers who tried to quit using all methods available in the market today, but find their nicotine dependence is too strong to overcome it by using these modern means," said the Cornell professor.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing getting a smoker nicotine high.
In tests, vaccinated mice which were later given nicotine continued their normal activities.
In mice which were not given the vaccine, researchers observed signs that nicotine later given to the mice reached the brain, researchers say.
These experiments were described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections were needed so frequently that the process became expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it uses liver cells as factories of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccines were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit.
"They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from smoking due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.

Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for what they bring as hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soft drinks, though their announcement on Wednesday indicated that passengers can leave yourself the whole bank.
The new fee applies to hand luggage stored in the overhead storage compartments, however small handheld bags placed under the seat remain free.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is payable in advance, and $100 if travellers pay at the gate.
A spokeswoman for Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee encourages passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to charge the higher fee," she said.
Airlines began to charge for the first and second bag checked bags in 2008.
Passengers, trying to avoid these fees began to make heavier use of more carry-on luggage; as a result of this increased demand, the overhead storage bins often do not have enough space.
Fees are one of the ways to make passengers less carry on board.
O'Malley said that this new fee is not really about making money.
The fact of the matter is that most loyal Frontier clients say that finding a place is the overhead storage compartments have become more difficult.
Passengers who bought tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue for a Frontier flight might be able to carry a bag for free, while the next customer in the queue could pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changes to procedures on the website and the Frontier check-in desk are intended to ensure that the passengers will know about the fee before they get to the gate.
The new Frontier hand baggage fee will not apply until the summer, though the date has yet to be set.
Passengers often complain of fees for baggage and other fees, but airline adore them.
They argue that the baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many on wall street believe the addition of baggage fees enable airlines collect to enough money to cover the costs of air travel after several years of losses.
But most of them are not related to the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand baggage fee three years ago and fellow discount carrier Allegiant Air later followed its example.
The only other airline in this group is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airlines consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the extra fees.
In his assessment of the report from December 2011, Spirit's charge for hand luggage brings in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines senior manager, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and he was wondered what he would find at the gate, where the passengers would face the atypical Spirit fee for hand luggage.
"The process of boarding was the smoothest of those that I have seen in my career in the airlines," he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and boarding went quickly."
Frontier also follows Spirit with respect to fees at $2 for coffee, tea, soft drinks or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who get soft drinks or juice, can have the whole can and that coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will still be handing out free water.
In 2008 US Airways attempted charging for drinks for a short time, but abandoned this after seven months, after passengers began to complain, and no other major airline not followed its example.
With respect to Frontier charging a hand luggage fee when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, it is the latest measure to attract customers to its web site.
Airlines pay online ticket providers such as Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gives all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than from online travel agents.
But frontier has gone further than others in this area.
In september, the airline started to give two times less frequent flier miles to customers who bought tickets through online travel agencies.
On wednesday the airline cut the number of frequent flier miles down to 25 percent of the miles travelled.
So on a 1,000 mile trip from Frontier, bought from an online travel agency, would earn 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has the base of loyal customers in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming less profitable.
Revenue fell 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results announced on Wednesday by its parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to rectify the finances of Frontier in the sale of the airline.

Putin has impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck missiles of Russian production, which reportedly targeted Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition to destroy their chemical weapons production facilities by 1 November.
This was done in the framework of the agreement brokered by Russia and the United States to avert military action, which nearly took place this summer.
Read more about weapons and about what all this means for the Syrian president, from our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said that Assad's regime will be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of U.S. bombing, but in the form of transaction, which made a friend of Assad, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria announced the decommissioning of a chemical weapons factory.
The more long term and arduous task - the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components.
As we understand, this is about a thousand tons.
Washington previously said that Assad's days are numbered.
I think Assad must go.
The question is not if this will happen, but when it happens.
He is no longer legitimate and must go.
But assad remains.
And feels more confident.
His forces are still using artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, many go hungry.
Some are forced to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons inspectors, who were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, has been called a success of diplomacy, and Assad himself stressed he is ready to cooperate.
Today in washington, the Syria ambassador to the U.S.A. had to answer tough questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother's pain is hardly easied because he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad still holds.
And changing weapons on power.

Tomsk man sentenced to 240 hours for an extremist video
The Leninsky district court of Tomsk sentenced a resident of the city, who posted an extremist video on a social network, to 240 hours of mandatory work, the Ria Novosti representative of the regional court press service reported on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013 the man posted a video on his page of the popular social network, which is listed on the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case against him was opened, based on alleged violations of the Russian Federation criminal code against "inciting hatred and enmity, as well as the humiliation of the dignity of the person committed publicly".
"Leninsky district court has considered the case in a specific order and found a man guilty of committing this crime, and has determined punishment in the form of 240 hours of mandatory work", the agency spokesperson reported.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.

Parents can choose to register intersex children "uncertain" gender
Germany became the first European country, which acknowledged a third gender for children born with external sex organs of intermediate type.
It will no longer be necessary to attribute a male or female gender to newborns.
The new law does not require parents to determine the gender of such children, allowing parents to register the gender as "indefinite" or "unidentified" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents that can result in quick decisions about surgery for assigning gender to the newborn, and counter discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, one intersex person said many years later: "I am not a man and not a woman."
I am a doctor's patchwork product of bruises and scars.
Every year, roughly one in two thousand children is neither boy nor girl.
These intersex persons have one of approximately 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual development disorders" — the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed external sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign a gender than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if it happens at all.
New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgical intervention, but the majority of children is do not present them," he said.
You can assign gender without surgery and then see how personality develops.
The science of how the child will develop a gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It is a mystery, why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the european commission in 2011, describes intersex people as distinct from transgender or transsexual because their condition relates not to gender, but to their biological structure which does not correspond to solely either male or female sex, and but rather has characteristics typical of both sexes or of neither.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual symptoms such as muscle mass, hair distribution cover, chest and physique; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and gonads.
The report also gives a general idea about the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crime based on prejudice.
Children with gender variations now have a special category.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register as male, female or "third gender" in its official documents.
In june, a 52-year-old resident of Australia Norri May-Uelbi became the first person in the world to be acknowledged in court to have the right to maintain "undetermined" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, German passports will mark the third gender, in addition to M or F — X for intersex.
In neighboring france, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on the TV channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, a deeply Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is involved in a new state, where gender is a matter of choice, and sexual activity — no, we still stand for these two pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn baby from the state of Maryland also announced that she would have gender specified for children at birth.
"It is difficult enough to raise a child, and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child," said the web site for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female reproductive organs were called hermaphrodites — after the handsome greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And yet just ten years ago the medical community described gender as a sheet on which we can all erase and then draw again.
But now many are questioning the ethical justification for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes makes the wrong choice, not knowing how the child's assigned gender will match as the child grows.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called'an urgent psychiatric case'," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't ring the psychiatrist — you rang the surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to treat children with intermediate genital type, was proposed by Mr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily amenable to change.
He introduced into circulation, the term "gender identity" and argued that the signals of the environment, including social signals — from parents to the child — interact with genes and the child's hormones in determining whether a person is considered to be a male or female.
But in one case of 1966, known as "John / Joan", his theories were called into question.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during a botched circumcision, that the child also be castrated, removing his testicles, and raise him as a little girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but this was not the case," said Drescher.
When he was about 15 years old, he became a little boy again and married to a woman.
But after 38 years, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that today some doctors are still "apply this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the internet, people who survived the sex change operation for declared themselves "dissatisfied with the result."
Such was the case of Jim Bruce, a writer from the state of Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but genitalia of intermediate type.
Doctors could not accurately determine whether he had a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live "a life of a man."
However shortly after his birth in 1976 Bruce's external sexual organ and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to take female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew that I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
After 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty.
But after suffering from depression and understanding that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he learned, it was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about this.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development, which kept his body from producing enough testosterone to enable normal genital development.
After learning the truth, he again became a man, taking testosterone injections and removing his breasts.
The procedure made him sterile.
Today, he works in defense of others in the organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring the perception of intersex people into normal view.
But Ann Temar-Mettis, executive director of the California association Legal Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "urges labeling and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take a hasty decision and give the child an "uncertain gender", she said.
We are afraid that this will contribute to intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign male or female gender, then to wait.
But we have not seen this law in action, so all we can do is make suppositions.
Temar-Mettis said her organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adults to make choice in favor of the third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their official sex," she says.
German law implies its assigned at birth.
It is a battle which small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr Arlin Baratz, a specialist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law "supports" parents, as well as children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a sexual development disorder called "complete androgen insensitivity syndrome."
Because her angrogen receptors work incorrectly, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Now, at 29, Katie is married and studies pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she is barren, she hopes to become a parent via adoption or having gestational surrogate motherhood.
"The law gives parents the time not to take any hasty decisions themselves," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do any analysis or understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female."
In this case you in order — baby love child.
You have a lovely child, and you feel joy.
We do not need to do the operation quickly, which is irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in solving and eliminates the worry that is driven by parents, because they do not feel that doing the right thing, "she said.
In the end the child decides what gender feels more comfortable for him or her — and that's fine.
This gives children the opportunity to decide on their own.

U.S. Secretary of State: the Secret Service sometimes "went too far" in collecting data.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that in collecting data, American intelligence services Proslushkakh "sometimes went too far." However, the politician noted that the information that appeared in the media about 70 million people being wiretapped does not correspond to reality.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed during this process, but it was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases it reached too far and was illegal in nature.
AFP quotes secretary of state: "The president and I accept it as wrongdoing... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future."

Experts at equestrian events gathered in Cardiff to fight for the prized "Horse of the year" knew that competition would be very high.
However, no one was prepared for the emergence of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before he took his first steps, this baby with his pet Shetland pony, Toffy, a lynx breezed through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This Nerazluchnaya pair — the same height — has received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held in the central city of equestrian sport, Sunnybank Radri, near Cardiff.
Leaving a general review to the background of men and women in elegant livery, he shifted his Nabekren Kepku and proudly guided around the two-year Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his innate ability with horses, which was not developed over years.
However, Toffy received the highest score for appearance and character.
Fenton was given Toffy on his third birthday in March of last year, and since then he has worked with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, also said: "Fenton and Toffy make a beautiful pair. "
They had a lot of rivals, but these two have gone with a gold cup and Rozochkoy.
This was only his second performance with Toffy, and we were all delighted when he won.
Total strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to have a picture taken with him.
This boy from the village that lies near Ebbwyl in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Cowells, which has showed horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Cowells said: "All of the audience was stunned, and all chanted, gasped, cheered, and waved."
He ran on the sand along the entire length of the arena and, although he looked tiny, he perfectly made his case.
Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens that he cares for.
Judging by how he started, soon he will take part in "Horse of the Year "— and I am confident that he will play well.
A spokesman for the annual horse fair said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The judges remarked on Fenton and Toffy for their appearance, and for the way they presented themselves at the show ring.
They value coherence of ponies and their breeders, and Fenton and Toffy were best in the ring.
I am confident that Fentonu helped him look attractive in the outfit; he was really good in his role.

Court suspends the execution of the ruling on the practice of Stop and Frisk at the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended enforcement of a court order demanding changes to the "Stop and Frisk" program of the New York Police Department, and the judge dismissed the case.
The United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals judge Sheindlin Shiry said that execution of decisions will be suspended pending the results of an appeal filed against the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it carried out the program for street detention and questioning.
The city appealed the decision and the resolution on corrective measures, including a requirement to appoint the controller to help the police to change work practices and related training programs.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard oral statements on the request to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal said there is a need to remove judges because they violated the code of conduct for United States judges courts with the need to avoid demonstrations of bias, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unnecessarily weighted against blacks and Hispanics in the "Stop and Frisk" program.
It has appointed external controller to oversee the far-reaching changes, which include reforms to the policies, training, and monitoring, and also agreed to launch a pilot program for testing Zakreplyaemykh on-body cameras at the police precincts where a majority of arrests take place.
In August, New York decided to cease the practice of storing the names and addresses of people, cases in which were stopped after a police investigation.
Debate on the city's appeal should be held after march 14, 2014.
"The tactic of stopping and searching" was criticised by many civil rights lawyers.
"Stop and Frisk "was practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching in 2011 in a record 684,330 people, most of whom are black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four people, all — representatives of national minorities, filed a class action in court.
Supporters of the changes to the "Stop and Frisk" program at the New York Police Department say that these changes will end unfair practice, provide a more reliable and effective police service, and could affect how other police departments carry out the practice.
Opponents argue that the change undermines the morale of the police, not the crime rate, would lead to unnecessary expenditure of money, and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions for the police due to the reduced number of officers by several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that it did not stop the practice of "Stop and Frisk," which complies with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stops people.

Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after the signing of the association with the European Union
The prime minister of Ukraine, Mykola Azarov, is convinced that prices will fall significantly in the country after the country signs the association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this in the course of the chat with readers on his facebook page.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a number of factors, including customs duties.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on the free trade area, the level of customs duties on the import of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
And this will mean that prices have to fall.
"This is with regard to goods that come from EU countries, "Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct; will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there should not also be a rise in prices.
So the message of the many billboards that have lately appeared in our country, that association with the EU is rising prices, it is not quite so. Or, to be more precise, not so "wrote Aazarov.

$325 Million rescue package for Tasmanian healthchare
The federal government insists that the bailout package of $325 million for Tasmania's weakened health systems will be accompanied by strict conditions that guarantee that the state wastes no money.
Federal minister for health Tanya Plibersek announced that the commonwealth is taking "urgent steps" to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.
A decision on funding over four years was declared after government consultations with Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie.
"The government proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems facing the state," ms. Plibersek said today.
The package of $325 million includes $31 million for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and surgery to remove cataracts, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for hospitals that accept patients without reservation, in Hobart and Lonsestone, to improve the quality of in-patient care, training medical professionals, mental health services and implementation of electronic systems of personal health cards in local hospitals.
"This investment will go to advanced doctors to allow for the implementation of ideas about how best to help the Tasmanian health system," said ms. Plibersek.
The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will operate with strict accountability and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive cash from the commonwealth, and produce monthly reports about where these additional funds are spent.
A three person commission will be created to make sure the state provides services as efficiently and more effectively.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will solve nothing "unless it comes with genuine reforms, which would put the health care system of Tasmania on a more sustainable track."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first turned to the prime minister in early May.
"I hope that the package of federal aid will significantly contribute to removing the health care system of this state from critical condition," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for recent cuts.
But the federal opposition spokesman on health, Peter Datton believes that today's statement represents "a similar solution."
"The reason we are here is that the state's Labor government squandered $430 million from the health system," he told the television network ABC TV.
When the government of the state is spending nearly half a billion dollars, and the commonwealth invests 300 million, you cannot pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Datton asked ms. Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar from the rescue package will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The Obama voter cry of despair
I voted for president Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change
He says Obama allowed Rebublican obstructionism to overshadow his laudable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as justification for the problems with the Obama healthcare reform website or drone attacks.
Memoirs of the obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have been
Nathaniel Morris p. - a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I read a terribly sad book recently.
I thought that this book would inspire me in times of gloom during the second year of medical school and restore in me a sense of hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win", a memoir about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
When I retire from my evening of writing reports on patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when policy inspired millions of people, and performances could capture the spirit.
Victory in the election was formidable, and leading news programs paused for reflection on this historical moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents hoarded all the newspapers they could find.
The White House was won by young team of strategists and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama got into office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a rude awakening, like waking from a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
During the years that have passed since I cast his first ballot, changes actually did occur.
It was more than I could even have imagined.
I give Obama credit for his large and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care, to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of "don't ask, not tell", the killing of Osama Bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the public health option and the closure of the base in Guantanamo, among others.
But after an innumerable number of times, when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I could not provide further explanation.
I have reached the point of political desperation.
Republican obstructionism could not explain the permission to spy on foreign leaders or ordering military strikes on innocent children in other countries.
He could not explain the collection of data about the private lives of americans, the national security agency or persecution of those exposing government misconduct.
He could not explain the murder of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Aulaqi without a trial or failure to comply with the limits of public financing and spending during the presidential campaign.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the White House efforts to silence the media, are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And lately he cannot justify the fact that he cannot develop a simple website within more than three years since signing the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know what I should have expected.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 years that a leader may contradict the political campaigns that precede him?
It is obvious that work on an election campaign is not predictable programme of action, because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and random events such as the carnage in Newtown will occur.
Yet all the examples listed above examples were largely the administration's own choices.
And that is what bothers me the most.
I voted for obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a strange and crass alternative, it seemed that he was not in a position to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections delivers hope, about which we have heard for so long.
However, when Obama's approval rating fell below 45 percent this week, to return to 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.
It makes me pine for many promises which were broken.
This week I read that part of the book, which describes how Obama was defeated by Clinton in the primary election in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting on the analysis of the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they should go back to normal and remain faithful to their purpose.
"I want us to return to our appeal," he said.
"We must remember who we are."
Five years have passed, Mr. president, and I agree with you entirely.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.

The first freely elected president in Egypt is sworn in
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of celebrations is unlikely to be the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when taking his oath, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, having replaced Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court, Morsi also became the first freely elected islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black in the court on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a ceremony shown live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life — absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, an engineer with an American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, the fundamentalist group which was a banned organization for most of the 84 years of its existence, and a target for tough action by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived with a small group shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential fanfare since Mubarak, traffic was stopped only for a short period of time to drive his convoy on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.
Although Morsi ridiculed as "spare wheel" "brothers", his personal prestige has soared since his victory and friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for islamists, but also all those who want to bring the matter before the end of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak's authoritarian rule.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in wood panelled halls where he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was provided with the official reception with the army orchestra playing the national anthem during which he stood by the "quiet."
Field marshal Hussein Tantawi, a military figure, arrived.
His arrival was greeted with the slogan "the army and the people are one hand," chanted by hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on friday in Tahrir square, where the uprising began, Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowing to reclaim presidential powers, which his office was deprived of the military council that has made the case against the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take the oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir square was filled with theatre with populist gestures.

Schools urged to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar
School English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and modern British fiction since 1914.
The exam will also be presented "programme texts" to encourage broader reading.
The combining English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015 onward, pupils will be obliged to take a final examination in language, with a strongly reccomended choice of English literature as a separate exam.
The department of education will tomorrow release new training programmes in English and mathematics — the first subjects scheduled to undergo radical revision.
It will make changes in other key subjects in the following year.
Separately, the regulator of qual exams will present a revised structure of high school exams, with the new system, assessment and less course work.
Speaking in the summer, education minister Michael Gouv said that they had "reached a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence", insisting that the school final examinations will be "more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Research shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours per week in the quarter) than most other countries do.
For comparison — the Australian schools devote an average of 143 hours per year, and in Singapore, pupils are engaged in about 138 hours.
Although not formally requiring that more time in the schedule will be spent on mathematics, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school final examinations in mathematics, in combination with an increased coefficient table ratings, will likely serve as an incentive to give schools extra training on this subject.
In the curriculums, more attention will be paid to "the tasks of real life" including financial mathematics.

Is football the reason for this hatred?
In the state duma within "the public platform" politicians and experts are talking about how to save the world in Russia.
And among the proposals voiced was this: ban football in the north Caucasus, because from this game - some scandals and discord have emerged.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled recent events in Biryuleve and said that to reduce "degrees of tension in society" politicians and the media should be careful and accurate in their assertions.
Perhaps he had in mind a recent scandal with vladimir Zhirinovskim, who in one television broadcast threatened to encircle the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they do not want to limit birth rates...
All the speakers talked about the measures on regulation of migration from the CIS countries, and on measures to harmonize relations between Russia's peoples, which made the discussions sumburnost.
Maksim Grigoryev said that events in Biryuleve "model a conflict that one could predict" but "for these questions we have answers too many people and the courts", and the seven babysitters child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which was practised Europe for a long time in terms of migrants, according to Obshchestvennika, failed, and we need to find their way.
Historian Yuri Petrov pinned high hopes on a new unified history textbook.
"We still need to create allowance on the history of culture of the people of the country to schoolchildren in Tatarstan knew that for people living in Dagestan, and vice versa, he said.
Gennady Zyuganov suggested criminalizing the "appeals to dismember Russia": "in the United States, if you say on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you get arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, very hard to "stir a not".
As usual, he accused journalists who get sick and acute national problems in public debate: "little in the heat of debate whether what you say!"
The leader of the United Russia faction "Vladimir Vasiliev immediately advised reporters to end the" charter "and agree to talk on the subject carefully, and then the same obligations may assume and policy.
We have taken about 30 laws which regulate migration, and in general order is installed, said mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that appoints regional and municipal authorities responsible for ethnic peace in their territories.
But Ludmila Andrichenko delight about this law is not divided: there are no clear ideas about what such an adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
It means that actors will interpret differently the volume of these powers.
In addition, municipalities have no personnel necessary to address such complex issues, no money, and methodical recommendations, which they could use the centre, are not provided...
The head of the duma committee on nationalities, Gadzhimet Safaraliev, offered to create a special office with the formidable name of "ministry of national security", which would be engaged in issues of national policy.
But Valery Artem Tishkov, who in the 1990s led a similar agency, subsequently opposed the proposal.
It is enough to have on the federal level, if anything, a special person or "minister without portfolio", to whom one might answer.
"We walk on eggshells, very important representatives of different ethnic groups and religions act together against provocations, and this work must get decent information support", said Vsevolod, church spokesman and chaplin for relations with society.
In his opinion, the state should not take on a neutral stance in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Oleg Nilov veered the debate in an unexpected direction: "more talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to look, but not pushing them on the way, not on the road," he said.
"Not the road" is the development of football: the footballer beat the crowd, the flags are burning, the fellows throw stones each other...
Do we need this kind of football?
There is another kind of sport - it's called rugby...
"They will be the best in the world at this sport!" Spravoross spoke ardently.
Rugby in the caucasus, everyone will play! - Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
You still curling them offer!
Need to know the national peculiarities, this would still suggest that...
In Yaroslavl, wild behavior in the stands was attributed to the representatives of the Moscow Club during a game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...

The recognition of the National Security Agency reinforces corporations' paranoia about state surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the federal service for the protection of the constitution (BFV), the German domestic intelligence service, its mission was to photograph the roof of the building, which is located less than 5 km from the European central bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BFV had hoped to discover the intelligence listening devices, and these actions led to the talks between the US and the ministry of foreign affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Klapper, director of national intelligence, in September, again promised that the United States will not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits. "
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a goverment whistleblower — began to publish the treasury intelligence secrets to the United States, European governments and executives are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. national security agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to the data stored in the cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of corporations, persecution by the state, to new heights.
The last straw was the news that the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel, may have been tapped for about ten years.
If the most influential person of Europe can become a target, then of course business leaders could be potential targets.
Snowden made apparent the intensive cooperation between the intelligence services of the United States and companies.
I think it is quite likely that this data is used for mutual gain.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, the president of the Association of Bitmi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies of Germany.
German companies believe the US now poses almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by consulting agency EY.
Nevertheless, in all the documents uncovered by mr. Snowden there as has so far been no evidence that the United States passed the trade secrets of foreign companies on to their own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain resources in the field of information technology and the internet, and expressed the opinion that he should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical of that.
Someone in the German parliament says that we must create a German Google.
I can only slowly close your eyes and open them again …
"This is not an option," says Gasso Plattner, president of the German business software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it cannot be allowed to die over 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything, apart from the IT industry.
And yet the scope and the technical development of espionage agencies of the United States, which had become famous thanks to revelations Snowden, were a shock for some companies who had previously thought that the greatest risk of exposure is China.
A big shift is happening in cloud technologies, where leaders of European companies better realized that data stored in the United States, are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to the study conducted by the cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of its non-American members abandoned plans to use facilities located in the United States, the cloud provider after revelations of U.S. data mining programme PRISM.
Jim Sneyb, one of the SAP executive board, said: "we are seeing that consumers are asking a new question, which has not occurred a year ago, namely: where are my data and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders argue that the last message — this is just confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and, consequently, these data should be protected at all costs.
What economic espionage is is no surprise.
It has always had a place.
"This has been a subject of discussion for many years and not changed substantially in the current debate," says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company Basf.
Americans monitor us on the commercial and industrial level, and we too monitor them, because it is in our national interests, protect our commercial ventures.
Leaders of corporations typically do not like to boast of the retaliation they have taken, as this can provide an advantage to the enemy.
Large companies have long suspected that to take a free usb drive at the exhibition or leave your laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least imprudent.
Ulrich Khakenberg, member of the board of directors of car company Audi, says that for many years it is standard practice — collect mobile phones before board meetings, so they could not be used as a recording device.
The federal office for the protection of the constitution in Germany recommends that managers of companies consider the use of simple pre-paid mobile phones during foreign trips because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones subsequently blown.
Nevertheless, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to sabotage and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources in order to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," the BFV report warns.
The United States warned their own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The US national intelligence summary in February placed France along with Israel and Russia in the second tier of offenders involved in spying for economic intelligence after China, says the Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when talking about economic espionage, the French are the worst of all. "
Bernard Skarsini, a former head of the french domestic intelligence agency, the DCRI reportedly said in an interview this month: the services know perfectly well that all countries, even when they co-operate on counter-terrorism, spying for its allies. "

Tripodi denies that was influenced by Obaid
The former New South Wales labor minister Joe Tripodi will undergo investigations by the anti-corruption authority in the state.
The former minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi did not approve the changes to the lease of maritime facilities at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obaid secretly controls shares in three facilities located on public land.

Tenants were against it, and wanted a long term lease.
In 2009, companies' lease agreements on Circular Ki which brought the Obaid family about $2.5 million a year, has been renewed without exposing the outdoor contest.
Mr. Tripodi, who was minister of infrastructure and transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially argued for open competition.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of mr. Obaid, who both admitted mr Tripodi, strongly advised to make changes in the rental of government policies.
The ICAC transcript of telephone conversations were triggered talk in august and september 2007 between mr Obaid, mr. Tripodi and steve, the senior official, who came to the ministry of ports after work under the leadership of mr Obaid in the department of fisheries.
"The question was whether, in the course of the reviews of these telephone conversations, the question of the development of commercial lease policy?" — asked assistant commissioner anthony mr. wiley Tripodi.
"No," replied mr Tripodi. —
I cannot remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not that.
Definitely not between me and mr. Obaid.

UN announces new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations organization must immediately begin to work on a new set of targets to replace the millennium development goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty around the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, due to expire in 2015, before a UN summit on sustainable development in Rio de Janeiro, which began the previous evening.
They were included in the final version of the document, which has been signed by world leaders, including ms Gillard, during the summit.
UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon said on the eve of the summit that "now is the time for participants to rise above national interests."
"I am glad that the UN member states agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals — LRC," he said.
The LRC will build on our progress in the achievement of the millennium development goals, they will become an integral part of the concept of development for the period after 2015.
I will do my best effort to use the authority granted me by the member states to fulfil our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.

The government will determine the exact levels for the region.
But when the entryway is painted, cells are put in order, or even the elevator is replaced - the tenants will decide themselves.
Such a law approved deputies in the regional duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional duma, said: "in this case, too, need to introduce proper order - installing sequence homes does not generate profits for managing companies - which have often register it in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then elsewhere, it will be the establishment of state control over the expenditure of funds, which attract residents with the repair of apartment buildings.
Under state control and now shared construction.
A law that protects from fraudsters, was aproved in the final reading.
The document was not written from scratch.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people were victims of dishonest developers.
Most managed to solve their problems.
By the way, the new law registers the rights and obligations for all the participants of the shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional duma, said: "it is no secret that in this area, too, began the abuses associated with the fact that in 1998 and in the 2000s dolshchiki are one and the same."
People have started to make money on the closing of the loophole, including these two, accepted the law.

Therefore, the last year on record, immigration brought slightly more than 100,000 foreigners.
But only one in five has official permission to work.
Where the rest are working and whether they pay their taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional duma, said: "they have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
The court is not present, and we need to deport them - they should be contained somewhere.
This decision took federation that, at the expense of the regional funds to equip such places.

For them, according to the regulations, the state will acquire housing of 108 square meters - over 3 million 300 thousand roubles.
For the left bank or southwestern district - this is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy for a cottage in town for this amount.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidelines for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations on the control of childrens food allergies of in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations, which is issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
This guide contains information for schools about how to increase awareness of faculty and staff about food allergies in children and how to help in case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools hold reserves of adrenaline — often used for epipen injections — to help with potentially deadly allergic reactions.
State legislators recently made a change in the rules to allow the schools to do additional adrenaline injections with fewer difficulties.
The notice also contains a list of typical symptoms describing children who have developed an allergic reaction.
Children might say: "I felt as though something pokes in my tongue," "I have this feeling that my tongue has hair" or "tongue hair."

The Kenyan press indignant about provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there is reason to question: what can prevent the destruction by the parliament of the independence of the judicial system in the future?" — wrote the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very severe and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Mau, managing director of the capital group - the parent company Capitalfm, which is one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said a new judicial authority on media "will always be partisan, since it is a continuation of the government", and restrictions on the content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the members of parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper the Star, the new law essentially allows the government to "take a stranglehold over the media," and the standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "received a serious blow" and attacked the bill as "draconian."
The adoption of the draft law is part of measures taken to enhance national security after the September attacks by muslim terrorists in the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media have caused anger authorities by broadcasting surveillance camera footage, wherein troops who were sent to the place of attack, presumably plundered the expensive shopping centre.
The response of the police chief David Kimayo was to call in two journalists and media officers for an interrogation, although the call was canceled after mass protests by the media.
Under the new law, publishers could be fined up to $20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million and the additional risk of being "removed from lists", that is, a ban on receiving official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the infringer, if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most radio stations."
It also said that these measures can have devastating effects on the so-called "lively" blogosphere in Kenya.
Politicians understand that if they force the media to be silent, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"Nobody knows," wrote the Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"Free-ranging politics ruin the country and will return us to the era of hunters and gatherers," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers were the target of public anger in the past.
In May they voted to repeal cuts enacted by the national commission on salaries, and restored the size of their enormous salaries of about 532 thousand shillings a month, tax-free — one of the highest in the world.

After accusations of poor taste, Eugenia Vasilieva is talking
Eugenia Vasilieva, a person who captured almost a year of media attention, has still never addressed numerous publications in the press about her embezzlement in the ministry of defence, as well as about her personal relationship with former defense anatoly, and about her love of poetry and valuable things.
However, on 1 November, she broke the silence on the Figurantka case.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev said: "originally, of course, the task was exactly one: me out of any negative information in respect of the former defense minister.
It was blackmail on the subject that I must testify otherwise I would be imprisoned.
Today, these threats have stopped.
Then we will go to court and prove his innocence.
We are 100 percent confident that we will win.
At the time of the interview, you can conclude that, perhaps, Vasilieva was most outraged by words about how she had no taste.
This probably refers to the statement by the official representative of the RF Vladimir Markyn about what is in the collections of paintings, which were seized when the Figurantka forgery case surfaced.
Among the seized property were a number of paintings which the hostess, being confident in their great artistic value, acquired as masterpieces of world art.
But historical examinations by investigators after the seizure of these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, frankly speaking, are cheap counterfeits, "said Markin in early October.
None of the paintings were stolen from the ministry of defence.
Then, having acknowledged that they were not stolen from the ministry of defence, he told me that I have bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss any personal matters?
In my opinion, this is simply an outrage, "says Vasiliev.
At the same time, the question of whether she admits her guilt although in one of her 12 accountable criminal episodes, Vasilyev said: "of course not.
I admit to nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation concerned.
Simply stop misleading people, once and for all.
In addition, in response to today's announcement of the RF IC that Vasilieva shies away from the study of the materials of the criminal case, Figurantka's lawyer said that he and his client "were not given access to the documents in the case by the investigator.
What was the cause of the revelations under house arrest - still not enough to satisfy the press?
Perhaps not as a woman, she failed to respond to the accusation of bad taste?
Or right journalists "Komsomolki" Utverzhdavshie a couple of days ago that she "weighing in on an even bigger trance" under house arrest because of news about reconciliation, Anatoly Serdyukov, with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
The famous military observer "KP" Victor Huperzia in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "investigators do not rule out that after such turmoil it may become more razgovorchivoy" interrogation.
Earlier Vasilieva some accusations of illegal sale of ministry of defence property took upon themselves.

The UK government announced a study aimed at improving the economic benefits for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 high-speed project involves the opening message between Scotland and the north of England, with the onset of the first stage in the year 2026
The transport minister baroness Kramer noted that the project "will unite Britain."
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was "delighted" by the prospect of working on a plan with the UK government.
The first stage will be to build a new high-speed rail line between London and the west Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the line will be built in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government has revised estimated the cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Scotland transportation about ways for HS2 ltd to further improve the capacity of the railway and to reduce the length of trips between northern England and Scotland.
This should include the shorten the trip from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "our aim for HS2 - to create a truly national network, which will make the UK and its cities closer together."
We are developing HS2 because benefits that it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a crisis of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also about transport connecting cities with each other; across 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be the best message to HS2.
Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown has called Mr. Karmaykla "unequivocally" support the inclusion of Scotland in a network of HS2.
Mr Brown said: "high speed railway has a chance to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds to the economic weight of Scotland the general argument for high-speed railroad across the UK."
Therefore, we are pleased to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and the continuation of a Glasgow - Edinburgh railway line, which the Scottish government is already planning for.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers in the next year and the joint decision on next steps.

The United States to cut food aid for the poor
Allowance for meals for a family of four is $36 a month.
From Friday the US reduced financial provision of grocery coupons, known as "FS" at the end of the corresponding state program.
The family food allowance for four people will now be allocated $36 a month less than in the past, officials say.
This will affect the 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012 the benefit for one person was on average $133 a month.
Spending on food aid in the United States rose to 80 billion dollars a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on free food aid on so-called "food stamps" a name from earlier, when they took the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
But Republicans in congress are demanding to enact further cuts in funds for the program, arguing that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Owners of food stores across America are worried that cuts will lead to a reduction in consumer spending.
U.S. congressmen still argue about how to further reduce government spending.

Because of new rules imposed by Russian customs, hundreds of lorries are in the queue on the border with Russia for nearly a week.
Today Donetsk officials promised to ensure drivers drinking water and access to toilets.
The border crossing points at the entrance to Russia has accumulated hundreds of lorries.
This situation has arisen because of changes to the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the issues arose on the Russian side, which previously did not warn about the changes.
On October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to ensure delivery of cargoes, said deputy head of eastern customs office Vladimir Denisov.
The new model is applied in countries that have joined the convention on international flights.
The checkpoints are in expedited mode.
Correspondent "Facts" traveled to the border and talked to drivers, who become hostages to the situation.
Prices in a roadside magazine cafe at the "Novoazovsk" checkpoint grow with each passing day, as does the queue of lorries.
Trucks stood in several lines stretched for about two kilometers.
Novoazovsk customs terminal - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on international motorways.
From there, the goods are sent in the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.

Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance at which it is being driven.
The minimum insurance - 4.5 − 5 thousand rubles (about 1100 and 1300 UAH).
Those travelling in (say, in Georgia or Armenia) with cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay about 15 thousand rubles (3800 UAH) for passing.
And the rest are stuck - I don't have have much money on me either!
Imagine if the driver takes a package worth just four thousand dollars, but all the way to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit.
Conditions for survival on the border - no - complain, truckers have ustroivshiesya near their vehicles.
At the border, shops and cafés and so are always expensive, but prices like these we have never seen before!
Sellers and their sorientirovalis quickly add up: 15 grivnas worth baton, seven hryvnias - the cup of coffee, 25 UAH - a plate of soup.
But one kafeshka-to.

Sony expects lower annual earnings
The Japanese electronics maker, Sony corporation, is ending the quarter with a net loss of $19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reducing the projected profit for the current financial year.
Sony results for the period from July to September 2013 were weaker than expected due to falling demand for televisions, cameras and personal computers manufactured by Japanese corporations.
In the second quarter, Sony's television business, having brought the company an operating profit at $5.2 billion yen for three years fell to 9.3 billion yen operating loss in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing difficult times, particularly due to lower demand for TVs.
And while competitors are keen to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main Sony rivals, Panasonic corporation, has lately shifted the emphasis onto industrial components: here, the company's sales are growing at a rapid pace, especially at the expense of automotive systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to get a 179 billion yen operating profit rather than the previously expected 230 billion yen.
The agency's analysts, according to Thomson Reuters, suggested that this figure will be significantly higher than $221 billion yen.
In order to emerge from the crisis, Sony will expand its product line.
In the middle of this month sales of smart watches from the Japanese corporation were launched, endowed with a number of fashionable features that will get rid of the need to pull a smartphone out of one's pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its annual forecast for profit and revenue, the company's shares in the morning at the opening of the market in Tokyo fell in price more than 11%, dropping to a level 1668 yen per share.

In uprazhnyayas "" ostroumii and alternative view on history, some publicists reach reasoning about what, say, it is a pity that the cultural Germans hadn't wild won the Soviet Union!
I think this is completely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual" cement of the nation, "Oleg Mikheyev is outraged.
In addition, according to the same patriotic minded people in Russia much more than religious, but in this case the law punishes for insulting religious believers and offending patriotic feelings can be almost with impunity.

The new features of public supervisory commissions will increase the influence of jailers
Today the council chamber (PR) can approve new members of public supervisory commissions (September protests) in 42 regions of Russia.
If adopted, the option being put to the vote will increase the influence of prison lobbyists.
The September protests are public structures that control the conditions of detention.
The case of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaeva and unrest in the Kopeyskoy colony - it is through the September protests that the most high-profile incidents behind bars got publicity.
There is a struggle for control of the September protests between human rights activists and lobbyists for the security service.
At a meeting of the public chamber working group on formation of the September protests, I offered to make selection experience of human rights work.
"He was not accepted, and formed the lists of criteria", says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev - the current chairman of Moscow and observation committee of the association of independent observers - national structure of human rights defenders in prison problems.
While a deputy of the state duma from Yabloko, he developed a law regulating the September protests.
The council chamber must vote on 43 compositions of the September protests in regions of the country.
At 1800 vacant seats are less than a thousand people, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria contests failed to organise because of a lack of candidates.
Bing promises to organize donabor on vacant places.
The September protests in Moscow is one of the few commissions with the contest, despite the fact that the new line-up will replace 20 of the 40 participants.
According to Borshcheva, in the current composition of the commission that 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces and in version, which is located on a vote in the chamber, the ratio varies by 17 to 23.
At the same time, in creating the commission they wanted to get 30 human rights defenders.
But in the new lineup could reenter "military brotherhood" said spokesman Vyacheslav Kalinin.
For three years he was a member of the September protests, but never visited detainees.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, by appointing a chairman from the September protests, will be able to do the work of human rights defenders, however intolerable human rights defenders are not mutually exclusive collective out of commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of the September protests by coordinating member Anton Flowers, head of the Russia "officers" organization defending the interests of security forces.
"I don't eat babies on the head ­truck", Anton Flowers told RBC Daily.
He denies that any of the lobbies promoting lists and says that is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting detained opposition activists.
According to 1972, he is not even interested in, for what kind of list now vote in PR.
Borshchevym sees disclosure of the information as a form of pressure.
The possible success of the human rights defenders - planiruyushchayasya leadership Chelyabinsk September protests.
Its former leaders sweep because of last year's unrest in Kopeyskikh.
The public chamber came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
But the september protests Rostov-on-Don can pass from human rights activists by security officials.
The new lists "missing" Pravozashchitnik-Predsedatel local commissions, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013, the public chamber disqualified him for bad behavior.
Lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshchev believes were "revenge for kopeysk".
Hopefully the revelations will not influence the September protests Mordovia, which consider "power": in a new staff wanted to get only one human rights defender, and she has not even accepted documents for the competition.
A member of the public chamber, Nikolai Svanidze told RBC Daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is revolted by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
Their position, he sent out to other members of the council.
His colleague in the PR Pavel Gusev says he voted for, because he likes the proposed list of Moscow.
Coordinated the drawing up of lists of the September protests, the deputy secretary of the PR Vladislav mushroom, also a researcher at the research institute of the federal service.
Mushroom told RBC Daily that it considers it right to divide candidates for human rights activists and security forces and do not agree with the fact that the chairmen of the commissions of enough power to obstruct the work of its members.
Mushroom is not predicting the vote of the council chamber.
If the proposed list of today will be rejected in the coming days to vote will make the changed version.

Clive Palmer claims that the MP Tony Abbott is embracing a conflict of interest on the issue of childcare leave.
Deputy Clive Palmer says the prime minister Tony Abbott is embracing conflict of interest on the issue of leave to care for a child because his daughters can get pregnant and gain from this benefit.
The mining magnate, who has an ongoing dispute on the payment of $6 million worth of carbon taxes, made this statement at the time when he tried to dismiss the questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's United party can control up to four votes in the senate, which could be crucial in deciding to abolish the taxes on carbon emissions and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer argued that the only conflict of interest was the minister's, and said that Mr Abbot's daughters will personally benefit from the political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid leave to care for a child, because if either of those daughters will conceive, then he will have a direct interest in whether they receive their leave or not," said Mr Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner in the fight for a seat on the sunshine coast, Queensland electoral district in Fairfax county with a margin of 53 votes after a recount of the votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the procedures of the counting of votes on the elections to accelerate this process.
Tony Abbott embracing daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should a decision be taken on these elections two months after we voted?
"We need to have a more advanced system," he said.
This is why we should not have such a system, so that it can come to enter your data into a computer, the right to vote and get a result at 18: 30 the same evening?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for marking ballots.
Is this because they can erase someones vote if they do not like it?
Using pencils in this era seems strange.
Electoral commission studying the options for electronic voting and recently published a discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-Year-old Mr Palmer said his program includes an international airport for the sunshine coast airport and he will take a "very serious" approach to his new job.
The state office provides service to society.
"We are not any of the awards, in addition to appreciation of history, for the fact that at a critical moment, we can serve this district," he said.

In September, the Ford motor plant in Vsevolozhske laid off 600 people.
The trade unions said that all who were laid-off received compensation.
However, much sharper than the problems of workers, questions are being raised about the reduction in industrial production in the region.
Regional deputy of Sachs Alexei Etmanov at the meeting said that the Ford plant in Vsevolozhske cut about 600 people.
According to him, this happened back in September, then on a programme of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with trade union organisations, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decide to quit on their own volition, were offered "golden parachutes" amounting to several times their salary.
Because of this, the vast majority of workers have left on their own volition.
However, according to Etmanova, for a number of people - it is a nightmare.
I think this is not limited.
However, authorities over the next two years do not plan to implement any of the programs to support regional enterprises, putting them in a difficult position, he explained, adding that when making a budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a big reduction in jobs.
Ford would neither comfirm nor deny this information.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as he appears, it necessarily'll.
Talks about cutting workers at a Ford plant in Vsevolozhske continue.
So, for example, the company's plans to sack 600 people became known back in September.
The plant previously announced suspension of car production.
As a reason to plant cited the drop in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostata, during the first nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region declined by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment fell by 11.5%.

Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev says GDP growth is insufficient and believes that the situation can be improved by easing credit conditions of businesses and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, reports reuters.
We planned this year for GDP growth in the region of 3%, maybe even a little more.
In reality, it will be slightly less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of recession in a large number of countries in Europe, it seems to be not too bad, but for us it is not enough because our economic base is not so strong, as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to grow, the rate should be higher.
It is now very important to Russian companies and Russian businesses to receive normal loans at a normal price - it is the first thing you should definitely make "the head of the government stressed.

Olympic snowboarder for bills specifically taking
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday released a commemorative bank note for circulation featuring the city of Sochi, where the next winter Olympic games will be held.
Denomination of the banknotes - 100 roubles.
But a network of bloggers are already actively ironiziruyut over commemorative notes.
After the presentation of the Olympic bills on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder on the notes can be found in Fotobankakh.
In particular, on the free photo site StockExchange, where this picture dates from 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop tutorial, published on the Russian web site "Megaobzor" on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it is already used in advertising for RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote featured the Sine-Goluboy mountain range.
On the one side, a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other side, views of the Olympic stadium and the firebird.
The designer of the banknotes, Paul Bushuev, won in a competition among students of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts named repin.
The presentation noted that it considered a few sports - skiing, freestyle skiing and ski jumping - but eventually opted for snowboarding, because it is a relatively young sport.
According to a Izvestia source, close to the central bank, the regulator is not indifferent to public opinion regarding the wide dissemination of images of the Olympic snowboarder banknotes and are investigating the situation.
And here Goznake is not too worried about the commotion around the Olympic notes.
Gosznaka's press secretary Natalia Nikiforova told "Izvestiyam" that all the discussion about plagiarism is funny.
The snowboarder is pointed to the right in the photos on the web - to the left - detailed Nikiforova.
The man in the photo was shot from different points for creating the banknotes, then the final images was selected because it is a characteristic pose of a snowboarder.
It also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic bill, as the artist received a salary for the job.
According to experts, the debate around the image on the Olympic bill is good.
The image on the banknote is a plus for her promotion, said executive director of "Rusbrend" Alexey Popovichev.
To prove 100 percent similarity of the images on the banknote and Fotobankakh is quite difficult, however, questions about the claims of intellectual property in this image are unlikely to come.
The first Olympic bill appeared in China - the Olympic games in Beijing in 2008 released a commemorative banknote in 10 yuan.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.

NSA blames "internal error" rather than hackers in termination of the site
Okutannoe secret National Security Agency announced on friday afternoon that their site shut down for several hours due to a technical failure, not hackers, as affirmed in the network.
"Nsa.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update", said an intelligence agency official in the letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that pereboy in work was driven by a type of distributed denial of service attack [DDOS], are wrong.
Earlier tonight online - system servers monitoring the site registered that the NSA had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable for some users.
Earlier a spokesman for the NSA told ABC news that the inner secret network of the agency "was not" vzlomana.
No secret information was in danger, a spokesman said.
At least one online khakerov-activist group stated that it is responsible for the failure of the NSA website and the DDoS-attack
DDoS-attacks are designed to explode traffic to the target web site until the servers are overloaded and the website crashes.
The hacker's attack tactics are relatively simple, and not designed for penetration into the internal network of the target system.
Previously the super secret NSA, nicknamed "No Such Agency", turned out in recent months at the centre of public attention and fierce criticism after revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and inside the country — all this reaction to the secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by disenchanted former nsa employee Edward Snowden.
The increasingly controversial agency has said that today's incident was the result of determined action of hackers.

Gazprom chief Alexei Miller said pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The beginning of the construction of the gas pipeline "south stream" in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
"Today, there was a landmark event: construction begain on the Bulgarian section of the'south stream' gas pipeline, a large-scale and important project in Europe," said Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
"South stream" is meant to diversify Russian export routes through Europe.
A dispute over a contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which is a large portion of the gas intended for European Russia, raises the level of risk for the usual routes, officials say.
Miller said that direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are removed "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from "south stream" at a reduced price, but only in 2015, when the whole project will be completed.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries, situated further along the route of the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual designed capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

In the process, it has created an unpleasant precedent: the court considered it possible to close media that, in fact is denying the right to promote counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
UAB "Rosbalt" news agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency has opened a second headquarters in Moscow and a number of regional offices.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former Soviet Union.
Since 2001, "Rosbalt" developed and functioned as a federal information-analysis agency.
By the mid 2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media organizations in Russia.
At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always held a rather specific niche: the nucleus of exclusive agency publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in the law enforcement agencies.
Talk about the proximity of the security sectors continued throughout the existence of the agency.
In addition, "Rosbalt" had an extensive base of sources in various departments, supporting such assumptions and implying that the project was led by Natalia Chaplin - the wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
Whether Chaplin held a leadership role at "Rosbalt" until the end is not clear: she is often referred to as a "project leader".
The director general of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the chief editor is Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently "Rosbalt" featured in the ratings of federal media - neither on the quote, nor the audience.
In October, the agency took 25th place in the traffic ratings of Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the data from LiveInternet, srednesutochnaya traffic to rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - around three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials over the past five months, notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist "group king and jester" pogroms in the metropolitan biryuleve.
The conflict between "Rosbalt" and Roskomnadzorom began in July 2013, when enforcement of amendments to the law on the mass media started, which banned journalists from using foul language.
The office found the forbidden vocabulary in two articles published on the website of the agency ("Dzhigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot Oskvernili Oil Rigs").
Further hand describe differently.
On the basis of the discovered video, Roskomnadzor accused "Rosbalt" of gross and systematic violations of the law on mass media and turned to the courts to deprive the agency of the license.
"Rosbalt" stated that claims departments nepravomerny: first, the videos were not redaktsionnymi materials, secondly, foul words in them were masked, and thirdly, immediately after warnings the videos were removed from the site.
The agency appealed the Roscomnadzor court claims - and on 22 October 2013 Mosgorsud took action Roscomnadzor, consideration of these complaints still continued.
But already the world number 25, the judge ruled in favor of "Rosbalt": chief editor Nicholas Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offences and was fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this is the outcome of the hearing and predreshilo Mosgorsude - if refuse from the idea that the outcome would be a foregone conclusion even earlier.
On october 31, the court decided to allow the invalidation of certificate of registration for "Rosbalt", effectively blocking media agency status.
This is not to say that "Rosbalt" remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency supported the state duma deputies (a statement in the name of the head of Roscomnadzor Alexandra Zharova signed on 10 October by 26 deputies; the document was filed on the initiative of the communist party).
About the closure of publications that claimed the head of the Russian journalists union Vsevolod Bogdanov, president of the Moscow Journalists Union Pavel Gusev and head of the Presidential Council on hHman Rights, Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanova, Roscomnadzor leadership even gave him any guarantees that up to revocation of the license deal is not reached.
The trial of "Rosbalt" showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a means of mass media in Russia today is the big question.

Speech Gene Stimulated Synapse Formation
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Hospital-New York Medical School found the protein that allows the Foxp2 "speech gene" to carry out its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in the journal Science, you can read his summary on their website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly associated with speech.
It's role was established in 2001, thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not utter words correctly and sometimes could not even understand each other.
Researchers found that family members have a disrupted Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function was not known.
In the new study, the biologists have shown that at least part of the function of Foxp2 is to stimulate formation of new synapses in the part of the brain associated with formation of speech.
It does this with another gene, SRPX2.
The latest discoverty was made during the search for the factors that encourage the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes, the authors found, but it was only activated via Foxp2.
What SRPX2 really affects is vocalization, scientists confirmed in experiments on mice.
When the animal's gene activation was artificially reduced, they cried less at the separation from their mother.
If the activation of the gene is restored, it restores the frequency of the sounds.
Previously the mice also showed a link between the vocalization and Foxp2.
The animals, which included a copy of the human gene pishchali activated and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists did not know what the function of Foxp2 was and, accordingly, state-steered them with the SRPX2 purely "mechanical" properties of education sounds or thinner processes.

Want to Illuminate the Dark with Ice Cream?
A British businessman has created the world's first glow in the dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal, to develop a light meal.
He came to this idea after reading a scientific article about the meduzakh, and convinced the scholars in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the language of one who eats it, increasing the ph level in the white of the eye and causing it to glow.
Chris says that since ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lizhete, the more it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the company producing ice cream "Lizni I Tasty", says: "It is an incredible thing, but still at the initial stage, if we talk about production, so for £200, you get about 2 grams of the substance."
A protein that we use in morozhenom, reacts with your tongue with a neutral ph.
However, when your mouth warms up the protein, it will raise the ph level and ice cream will start to glow.
We tested it in the last few months, and it seemed that the ideal would be to introduce it on Halloween, because it creates such a luminous effect.
It is, perhaps, the most expensive ice cream available, that I've seen, because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball cost me about £140.
But it is very pleasant to the taste.
Charlie's Pilot company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of mosaic gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really want to develop invisible ice cream."
It is by definition impossible because of refractive errors caused by ice crystals, which is ice cream, but i think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish, sintezirovannye chinese scholars

Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the intelligence issue
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, said he is ready to go to Berlin to give a statement to the German parliament, if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander will not answer questions about its activities.
German MP Khans-Kristian Shtryobele on Thursday met with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss him giving testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, which he presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: "Although the outcome of my effort was clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges, which gives it no protection."
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community can convince the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges, from the Ministry of Justice against the US, include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk with German officials, we will find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have become strained after claims that the NSA proslushivalo the phone of chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, MP, who chairs the parliamentary group, Kuriruyushchuyu Razvedsluzhbu, said that if there is a possibility to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, "not exposing its dangers and not breaking relations with the United States fully", it must be used.
Mr. Shtryobele, a member of parliament from the green party of Germany, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on his twitter feed.
During a visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Shtryobele said that, according to the lawyer for the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden gave testimony in Germany, he would need a guarantee that he will be there "in security", said the MP.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a "tough and steady" campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was "encouraged by the global response to his political statements."
Citizens throughout the world, as well as senior officials — including the United States — have found the exposé of an unregulated system of ubiquitous surveillance useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."

Foreign workers on podklassa 457 visas can be tested for "authenticity."
The test of "authenticity" for foreign workers on class 457 visas is pending government, because it means the extension of repressive measures.
This test, in case of its adoption, will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of the class 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as loopholes to move family and friends to Australia.
The document presented by the government for discussion, was published today, while the former Labor MP M. McQ attacked government rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might offend neighbors of Australia.
"Loud statements like 'foreigners — at the end of the queue' and 'jobs for Australians first' represent a very nasty time when unions demanded a protected labour market", she said at the Instutute of "Australia — India" today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labour that needed protection - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The submitted paper sets out 12 measures that had previously been considered by former immigration minister Chris Bouenom.
Immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about the smuggling of people, already has five of the recommended changes, while the others are under consideration.
If the criteria of "authenticity", to be accepted by the visa applicant can be explored on the subject, "is a genuine candidate at a time when the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance the owner or person having the attitude towards financing the company."
The companies also may be asked to report on the number of podklassa 457 visa holders since before the enterprise, Namerevavshiesya sponsor a small number of employees, then took on the job of hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35 year old Sri Lankan, seeking asylum, has reportedly died of a heart attack soon after arriving by boat with refugees at Christmas Island this week.
The grieving nine-year old son of this man accompanied him on the way to Australia, and since the death of his father on Wednesday is supported by a cousin, who was also on board.
Australian authorities hastily sent the man to a hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.

The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to ensure Ukraine gas, and also to reach an agreement with the IMF about an emergency loan, if Russia would take any action in response to the possible signing of the association agreement between the EU and Ukraine on the Vilnius summit.
Negotioans are under way with the iMF for a stand-by loan, but another EU official, directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is the conclusion of the agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can get 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts, surveyed by Reuters, doubt that Ukraine and the IMF will be able to overcome long-standing disagreements about funding conditions.
Do not believe in the possibility of reform, necessary to get help, and international rating agency S & P, ponizivshee on Friday Ukraine's sovereign rating by one notch, from "B-" to "B".
However, EU officials say the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the plan of financial support for the country, the EU has a fallback option to provide Ukraine with gas, the majority of which now comes from russia.
Perhaps this will be the gas from the "Nord Stream" or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is a possible and acceptable manner in the event that Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that reversing supplies to Ukraine could be used in only a few weeks, and will likely lead to lower supplies in other regions.
"Talks are being held between EU countries and the Ukrainians about how to create conditions favorable to Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes", Reuters source added.

Americans eavesdrop on japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of the American special forces, who preferred not to disclose his name, said that the United States eavesdropped on telephone conversations of senior officials of Japan.
This person confirmed that in the land of the rising sun, there are several places targeted for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand did not engage in intelligence activity against each other.
According to him, as it was during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite alliances with the Americans in the postwar period, are objects for intelligence-gathering activities, NHK television reported.
Officially, neither of the parties has not commented on that information.

Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said that he was ready to share details about listening activity between the calls of Angela Merkel and German prosecutors.

Italian workers with experience give way to the young
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Data published on Wednesday showed that those without work is now 12.5% of the inhabitants of the country.
The situation has not been this bad since the Second World War.
Among the young, the number is several times higher.
4% Of residents aged 15 to 24 years of age are unemployed.
In the opinion of the italian authorities, one of the solutions to the problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Ekperiment already holds the largest energy company in the country and adopted laws allowing regional authorities to provide partial pension for workers who qualify.
However, on the other hand, Italy is common example of Europe's aging population problem.
Economists are not convinced that early retirement of older personnel will fix the problem.

Syria destroyed equipment for making chemical weapons
Syria destroyed all the declared facilities for production of chemical weapons, as recognized by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
Damascus finished the first stage of the disarmament the day before the deadline.
By 1 November Syria was to destroy the manufacturing and other auxiliary objects intended for combat training in the use of toxic substances, reports the BBC.
The destruction of the stockpile of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by the middle of 2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, currently toxic substances are in Opechatannykh repositories.
International inspectors went to Syria after, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people were killed by on 21 August by chemical attacks on the outskirts of Damascus.
The main task of the inspectors was to not give Syrian authorities time to produce more chemical weapons and to destroy infrastructure equipment for mixing chemicals and munitions.
Inspectors will now be carefully watching these manufacturing facilities to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is the middle of November: by this time the OPCW and Syria must agree to a detailed plan of destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
A lot of questions here.
Where will they be removed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by western razvedsluzhbami.
The inspectors are ready to test new substances to see if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not being fully candid.
The United States believed that the shelling was being done by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this was the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded from the Syrian leadership that it is in accordance with the agreement reached and mediated by Russia which is to destroy or make inoperable all capacity for the production of shells, toxic gases and liquids and shells for filling in these substances.
Now, when this phase is complete, the next step must be to destroy the existing the Syrian army chemical weapons.
It is assumed that this arsenal could be more than 1,000 tons of toxic substances including kozhno-naryvnogo, nerve gas, mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
The agreed upon time table between the OPCW and the Syrian authorities for its destruction is two weeks.
The head of the OPCW field operations, Jerry Smith, told the BBC that his inspectors "personally watched the destruction of the equipment
"And they now have no capability to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons", he said.
In the statement, the OPCW said its inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and were convinced the factories that manufacture shells and toxic substances, were either destroyed or are being destroyed.
The remaining two objects were too dangerous to carry out an inspection, the document says, but the equipment was carried out and inspected by specialists of the OPCW.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the production infrastructure was especially difficult due to the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW was awarded the Nobel peace prize, however; according to Smith, the inspectors have not had time to celebrate yet - they were too busy with work.

George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives Scotts choice
Another day, another strike on independence.
This time, we warn that an independent Scotland should join the European free movement area as a condition of EU membership.
It's the same stories about passport control in Bervike and barbed wire along the border of Adrianova shaft.
True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits from the more liberal movements in the rest of Europe, though — predictably — not that it has appeared in headlines.
Also, one does not need to point out that the EU member states spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as it is convenient.
Because Scotland is not included in the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with the requirements will become a cheap concession to Brussels in return for what he truly wanted from the Scots.
So this story is not one worthy of attention.
This story is so old that she has become a fossil: I first heard "duck" about what "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting point lost on pereskaze ancient tales.
Why should an independent scotland comply with orders in Europe?
Why change the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is real european news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe finally stalled.
The Evrokrizisom project "Europe" is officially dead.
Across the European Union the party opposed to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a single currency is gaining strength.
Even in Germany, "Euro-skeptics party alternative for Germany, founded only this year — appeared from nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the September federal election, thus displacing essentially" free democrats "(the equivalent of" our ") liberal democrats, from the Bundestag.
There was always the internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
Austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the common currency have led many people to believe that the project "Europe" has gone too far.
The euro crisis is connected with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits — this was true only for Greece.
In fact Evrosistema blocked its members on favorable exchange rates, for German exporters, and that is what German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, Southern Europe is at a disadvantage in advance of production capacities in comparison with Germany.
The only means of spasitelnoe is to cut wages and government spending that are actively supported by Berlin.
For the current budget problems and exchange is a much deeper problem of the productive capacities of Europe.
As a result of measures to "green" energy, embedded Brussels subsidies — a cipher for French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
This paralizuyushche adverse price terms, as we have already seen in greyndzhmute.
Freezing wages in the world does not stop overwhelming victory of cheap shale gas in the United States over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result a rebellion is brewing, especially in France, once the most storonnitse EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needed Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy and has already imposed its own economic policy of Europe leaving the destroyed the economy of France in distress.
The result — the Right acting against the EU Party Marine le Pen of the National Front "just won the decisive run-off election by discarding the ruling party of socialists into third place.
"The Front Line" is now the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning to the British that it would not proceed from the assumption that the split among the right automatically means favor of the left.
What makes le Pen with their newly inherited popularity among french white working class?
She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year to create a bloc in the European parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If — and it is very likely — opposition to EU parties will receive support in this election, this unit will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European parliament.
Here is my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not go away, but becomes something of a "vague Europe (sovereign) nations," which like General de Gaulle.
Germany and several economies dependent on it can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency.
I assume that Britain distances herself from the project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Nevertheless, the growing interest from Washington to the Pacific Ocean indicates the likelihood that Britain will be left without attention into the cold Atlantic.
In what position does that leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (essentially) of England
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send Berlin and Brussels to Hell in a handbasket.
I suspect that Scotland can succeed in the freer European agreement provided that we will keep its currency.
Cooperation with other stranami-edinomyshlennikami will be easier in europe nefederalnoy nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence.
The government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is — ironically — the most successful political movement in Europe, and against the austerity measures, which received a majority of the votes in 2011 due to objections against cuts proposed (and sold) labour chancellor exchequer aleister darlingom and subsequently raised by the coalition of tories and liberal democrats.
Scotland would be ludicrous now to vote for independence, only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.

An Australian woman lodges appeal against jail term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney was appealed her verdict and was released on bail after spending 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for the false claim that she was attacked by a taxi driver.
Rochelle Stevie Bamford was originally found guilty on 15 June in Pkhuketskim provincial court for filing a false claim to Thai police reporting that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday 10 June while two other men held her.
A surveillance camera recording later revealed that she safely returned to her hotel after severing ties with her boyfriend.
Police held Bamford for two days before she admitted that she fabricated the story.
Before the court it contained in the local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in the heart of detainees general regime on the outskirts of pkhuketa, not in a women's prison for adults.
She is the daughter of the former Australian league player Peter Tanksa, who applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanksa told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely" concerned about the well-being of his daughter and was waiting for her return to Australia.
"Obviously, it is a grim time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible," said Tanksa.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to Australian reports, she was on vacation in the Krabi resort area in Southern Thailand at the time.
Nakhodyashchiesya in Thailand, legal sources said Bamford is currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but he has warned that an appeal could lead to the court sentencing her for up to two years and make her serve time in prison for adults.
After the recent killing of australian tourist Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand, Thailand may seek to rebuild its dissipated tourist image which could lead to a lessening of the reported sentence.

Early puberty: aging earlier
Afro-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, studies show.
Physical changes do not mean that have completed puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the mechanisms of early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Mothers were asked if they noticed whether their daughter had begin to form breasts and pubic hair growth at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents — usually it does not mean the rapid advance of full sexual maturity," said Kaplovitts.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts and pubic hair appear earlier in girls.
But there is only a slight shift in the age of menustration (first period) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12.75 years in 1970.
"After breasts begin to develop, is at least two to three years before menustration", — said Kaplovitts, who is also the author of "Early Puberty In Girls: How To Cope With This Widespread Problem."
Time is the most accurate check of how puberty will advance.
There is debate about what constitutes an active sexual maturity, but is considered "premature" when breast increase is accompanied by a sharp rise in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow and the pediatrician can monitor carefully.
More rapid progress can serve as the basis for endocrologist analysis to avoid serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which ultimately can lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitts is cautious with drugs, but acknowledges that the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers. "
Another big problem is clear: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They worry about the risks of pregnancy, or even about how they cope with hygiene issues," said Kaplovitts.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman, her daughter started menstruation when she was 10 years old.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school, scared and distraught that it first happened among her friends.
There are many razreklamirovannykh theories about the causes of early puberty.
There is no consistent evidence to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media.
Boys — like girls, experience puberty earlier.
Kaplovitts argues that the premise which has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years old which correlated the amount of body fat with the onset of puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, Afro-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
There is widespread notions that early puberty is apparently affected by everything including economic conditions, climate change, and genetics.
Another mystery: although boys have hair on the face and their body at younger ages, the trend to completing sexual maturity is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians participating in the conference of the AAP confirmed the complexity of this subject.
The emergence of pimples and pubic hair is found even in infants and children of nursing age.
"We must be careful about how we define the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Laurence Silverman, child endocrologist at Children's Hospital at Gorieb G. Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from a pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
"It may mean an earlier than expected conversation," Kaplovitts.
If you keep calm, your child normally reacts well.
Especially for girls that blossom early, they need assurance that this process is a normal part of life.

Rbs shuts off two currency traders
Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily evicted two traders in their subdivision from their work on currency transactions, according to two people familiar with the situation, that is further proof that global regulators checking alleged manipulation in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are co-operating with regulators in the investigation of the world's largest financial market, of which the daily turnover is $5.3 trillion.
These will be the first two traders by rbs, during the progressing investigation, which dovetails with the scandal involving the manipulation of the Libor interbank rate.
Refusing to comment on the removal, the bank confirmed that this month he received requests for information about the regulators.
"Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the fca and our other regulators," — the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month the knowledgeable person said that rbs had sent the e-mail and instant messages his former trader received and sent the uk regulatory authority trying to control financial activities (fca).
This trader, richard asher, resigned from RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, he was granted leave on his current european head of spot fx trading at JPMorgan.
Ramchandani, head of european spot trading in Citi, went on vacation this week, while matt gardiner, a former senior fx trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work at Standard Chartered bank this week.
None of these traders were accused of any violations.
A group of contacts mr usher instant messaged included bankers from barclays and citigroup, according to knowledgeable people.
Bank ubs said this week that he has taken action against some of its employees after the swiss regulator finma said he is investigating alleged manipulation in the currency market in a number of swiss banks.
At least six of the regulatory authorities in the world — the european commission, finma, switzerland antimonopoly body weko, fca, the u.s. department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority is considering allegations that bankers were in collusion to impact on the foreign exchange market.
Hsbc, citigroup, jpmorgan and credit suisse also began internal testing or have received requests for information from regulators, said a person familiar with the situation.
Banks sift through instant messages and emails for several years in finding cases of wrongdoing.
News about the checks conducted on traders in recent years in this sphere of activity, which was one of the largest sources of income trading divisions of the investment banks, now though, however, is faced with difficulties because low volatility of currency reduces the opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have sought to downplay the seriousness of the situation, saying this extensive and vysokolikvidnym currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
In the words of a senior trader, despite the huge amount of daily trades in the foreign exchange market, liquidity fragmentation between different trading platforms, and wider use of the banks' own internal platforms means that "you can begin to influence the market for one low price."
The news came on the same day as the bank Credit Suisse announced they sacked one of its traders of the stock trades on the London Stock Exchange this week after he inflicted losses amounting to nearly 6 million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this question was able to pinpoint," said Credit Suisse.

John kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that USA espionage "went far nepodobayushche"
John kerry demonstrated easing tactics to protect U.S. tracking programs, making an unprecedented acknowledgment that in some cases, us spying "went far nepodobayushche."
The secretary also acknowledged that the guilty, along with Barack Obama, has been "on autopilot" during the appearance of the high-profile revelations by Edward Snowden about the espionage activities of the NSA.
These leaks have put the US government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link on open government conference in london, mr kerry said: "there is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government actually took some things happening on autopilot, because that possibility already existed — and during the second world war, and in the very difficult years of the cold war, and, of course, september 11."
Then he became the first senior member of the government of the United States to recognize that the US espionage has gone too far, but stressed that individual rights were not violated.
He said: "in some cases this has come far nepodobayushche.
And the president is determined to shed light on this question and explain to people, and now conducts a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has the feeling of abuse.
I assure you, the abuse of innocent people is not present in this process. "
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good intentions and that its tracking operation saved many lives.
He added: "we are in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
In the world there are radical extremism, bezrassudnyy and determined to kill people, blowing up people and attacking the government.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevent crashing planes, explosions of buildings and killing people because we were able to learn more about these plans in advance. "
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers napravyatsya in Europe to help resolve issues associated with the alleged U.S. espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism measures with the United States, said the chairman of the senate subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday.
The senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy said he talked with members of the European parliament, and the other parties on this week and is concerned about their threats to suspend participation in the anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with the persecution of the national security agency.
"For us national security interests are really important to europeans remained our supporters in respect of our joint counter-terrorism efforts," said democrat Murphy, working in the position of first term and is the chairman of the international relations of the senate subcommittee on european affairs, in an interview from Washington.
"And i am going to europe, to get them to understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these nsa programs."
News that the NSA collected millions of records of telephone calls in europe worsen relations with some allies of the us, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding that collected metadata on NATO allies and which they shared with the united states.
In other quoted Snowden razoblacheniyakh released documents showing that the NSA continued monitoring the mobile phone of german chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as phones of approximately 34 other world leaders.
Director of national intelligence James Klapper defended espionage activities in respect of allies as necessary and said that it is commonplace on both sides.
Against the backdrop of this hype Murphy said his office organizes a trip for members of congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators should be voiced in the coming days.
According to him, the programs of the trip are still at the development stage.
Although Murphy has said that the goal of the trip is to improve relations, he said that "a degree of well-meaning rigidity" will emerge.
He said that european leaders must be honest with his people in what spyware programs they have used for many years.
"While we can change our tracking program to better protect the rights of europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only people involved in intelligence activities," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, mr Kerry will head into this weekend in the middle east and in Poland for solving the problems of hostility against the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, but also the United States intelligence activity.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, halloween was magical.
We were allowed to eat candy with his sister, go to bed late and wear costumes around the neighborhood.
Now I am more at pokhozhu skryagu.
I am not vyzyvalas in the past two years, handing out candy at his apartment and, most likely, will not and this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow in regard to halloween.
According to the national retail federation, the majority of americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate halloween this year, and spend a total of $6.9 billion on costumes, candy, and decorations.
The only thing I wait every halloween is trending.
The national retail federation predicts that the suits will be spent $1.2 billion from $6.9 billion.
This year sexual inanimate objects are at the height of fashion.
Women no longer need to be members of the professions of sex; they can also be sexual food such as pizza, gamburgerami or morkovkami.
As for the men, I think we will see a lot of zombie thanks "khodyachim mertvetsam", and i am confident that the astronauts in the style of the band daft punk tapes to be in our 11 this year.
According to google, the most common costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps, there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We naryadili our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the national retail federation, americans spend $330 million on costumes for pets this year.
This means a lot of funny sobak-khotdogov.
When it comes to sweets, we do not melochimsya.
Americans spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
This is about 600 million pounds of candy bars, hershey sweets, milk duds, chewy candy bars, twizzlers and clark bars.
According to the U.S. department of commerce, this is excellent news of sweets for 41 million children who got ready to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — will not deceive ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during halloween.
The only thing that we do not want to use is in the form of candy corn; and yet, according to the national confectioners association, nearly 35 million pounds of it is sold for halloween.
This is about 9 billion individual corn kernels.
This is the conundrum that I still have to solve.
Nothing so expresses the essence of halloween as a haunted house.
They have terrific names, such as "terror behind the walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "whine and cry" and "house of shock."
Moreover, according to the society of america haunts, in america, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses, generating about $500 million of income, as well as the stunning photos where you almost opisalas that your friend posted on facebook, and you cannot remove, and then the guy who you like, sees this picture and leave a comment like "cool expression."
And in conclusion, let's talk about the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the great pumpkin when we were children, and cutting a jack-o-lantern — is like a christmas tree ornament, what we are doing with childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion on the child in pumpkin began only in the past year thanks to pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these pumpkins, and not sitting in them.
According to the United States census bureau, this year americans spend about $106 million on the pumpkins.
The jack-o-lantern, slowly drying on your porch, probably arrived from the state of illinois, which raised 542 million pounds of pumpkins this year.
If you want a task even harder come visit Tim and Susan Metisdon in the town of Napa Valley in California and try to cut something out of their pumpkin, weighing 2 pounds.

The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in a "bizarre coincidence", believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside the collapsed sports gym mat at his high school, believe their son was murdered, a lawyer for the family said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found January 11 in a vertical gym mat, prislonennom back to the outside in the gym of his secondary school.
Lowndes county sheriff department investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17 year-old teenager disagrees.
"They are absolutely sure that their son was killed," said Benjamin Kramp, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died as the sheriff says.
"They believe that this contradicts the logic, the laws of physics and common sense" — kramp said.
They think that it is cover for the protection of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with his school bag, and he was returned to them in a bag for corpses, "he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that it was conducting an investigation into the death of Johnson, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Whether his death was the result of a crime?
Moore made the announcement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I izuchu all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to get to know the truth.
"I am of the view that there are sufficient grounds for an official investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that initial autopsy found that johnson died as a result of the position.
But a second autopsy, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
"There are several issues that must be resolved, or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnson, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
Lowndes county sheriff department spokesman was not available for comment when approached on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a south Georgia judge ordered authorities to publish all video surveillance cameras, which investigators viewed.
Parents of the teens said that they hope the recordings contain the clue to how he died.

The owners of pawn shops in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
At pawnshops at the Bendemir shopping mall in singapore, Dzhanani Amirtkhalinga pawns a golden bracelet, a ring and earrings to pay for his daughter's education.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there," said Ms. Amirtkhalinga.
Although she earns s$ 3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator, and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of southeast Asia — where household debt is growing — is high at Valuemax, where she takes the deal this week, which has became the third pawnbroker registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Credit for pawned jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (s $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirtkhalinga), but is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually, pawnbrokers in Singapore offer an effective annual interest rate of 17% — slightly above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender, with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or evidence of wages, and can give loans faster than banks.
However, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnbrokers as households feel the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth following the global financial crisis, cheap credit and Podpityvavshikhsya's loose monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers to compensate for the decrease in revenues with the slowing growth of their economies.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's indicated an increase in household leverage, mainly due to mortgage growth, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It announced that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists also worry about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely emerged from a technological recession.
On thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with the higher prices, people in the middle and bottom of the income scale will look for ways to supplement their incomes whereever they are able, "says Song Seng Vun, an economist at Malaysian bank CIMB.
Record-high gold prices in the past two years have reinforced the IBSC board, as people hock their personal belongings to get money for their family jewellery.
In Singapore, approximately 70% of the items listed in 200 paragraphs at pawn shops in the city-state are gold products.
People say: "the price of gold looks good, let's hock grandma's gold chain and get it back next month. "
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawn shops, Easymoney, observed an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in pawnbrokers' business is such that Valuemax, operator of the Bendemire pawn shop and 15 other similar shops in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside of Asia, too, says Yeakh Lee Ching, the executive director of Valuemax.
The company will finance the expansion with 60 per cent of s$ 66 million raised this week as a result of putting shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked the ire of critics because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeakh says that not only do pawn shops offer cheaper rates than other lenders, they also do not increase debt directly.
"Clients hock items that they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households," she says.
Hocking wins wider public recognition as a means to obtain short-term secured funding.
And pawn shops benefitted not only from those categories of people who are in a precarious financial position.
Rich people in Singapore also use Valuemax, hocking gold ingots or a Rolex, which can yield up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We are seeing clients from all sectors of society.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties," said Ms. Yeakh.
Sometimes they simply need money very quickly.

Bashkiria grain can't be traded before early 2014
The course of public procurement interventions can put off grain trading until early 2014, said Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Bashkiria Nikolay Kovalenko.
To date market prices are such that they do not encourage the sale in the Interventsion Fund.
When the market price is higher, and there is a demand,
"Perhaps grain will be put up for auction after the new year ," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The minister recalled that in the current year, 2013, harvested crops yielded 3.1 million hectares, including the area of crops - 1.7 million hectares: by 3,3% more than last year.
The 2014 harvest reached 550 thousand hectares (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The increase is in the area that grows wheat; rye and triticale remained at the same level.

Russian security officials had not known about the "fraternal Circle" gang, Novye izvestia
Interfax.ru writes about this, citing an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After reports appeared in the media about the case by the U.S. Treasury in the most recent checklists of people suspected of belonging to the Eurasian criminal Syndicate'Fraternal Circle, 'we looked at all of the databases, but such a group was not found", the interlocutor of the agency said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously mentioned, yesterday the U.S. Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal gang "Fraternal Circle ".
Among them Russian singer Grigori Leps was named.
He appears in the list as "grisha", posted the day before,
Coincidingh with this popular Russian singer.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, his performing name, and his place and date of birth.
In addition, in the next step, there were five more people:
Two russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another with origins in the former Soviet Union, whose nationality is not specified.
In the United States, they are confident that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the crooks on their request.
Attached to this, a message and photo of the singer lists all of his data, which is accurate.
Moreover, Leps, did recently buy a house in Phuket.
The FBI said they intend to impose sanctions in the next step.
Entering the man in the black lists of the American Treasury Department involves freezing his assets in the U.S. and a ban on business contacts with him for persons residing in the United States.
Next, Assistant Maya Serikova stated that no notifications had been sent to the singer himself: "It is hard to answer the question of whether it is Grigory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States ."
All it knows is Leps' media information.
Officially, to him personally, there was no notification, even though I don't know whether there are any in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, sudden and surprising," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps lives in Phuket but, the U.S Treasury Department argues that he really lives in the house on the Thai island.
She said that Leps now is on a long tour to the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him on the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.

Do you have a black box in your car?
When American designers try to find money to repair the highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, neatly installed on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, tracking every traveled mile and transmitting this information to officials, are at the center of controversial attempts to modernize the antiquated system of financing the highways of America by Washington and the states.
Usually a boring arena, highway planning suddenly gave rise to intense debate and romantic alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the government for the right to use the small design to track the number of miles you drive and even, perhaps, where you drive them - and then use this information when drawing up the tax bills.
The Tea Party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union also is deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy questions.
Until congress can whether to continue, several states are not going to wait.
They ponder how, over the next decade, to go to the system under which drivers pay for each mile driven.
Thousands of motorists had taken these black boxes, some of which include satellite tracking, for testing.
Is it really necessary for our country?
"This is not an issue on which we might have the right choice," said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which plans to start tracking the state authorities miles driven by every California automobile by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technology to do this already exists.
The need for this is aggravated by a lack of funding from the government fund for the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay on fuel.
Americans are not buying as much gasoline as before.
Cars more miles per gallon.
The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax by even one cent at high gasoline prices.
"A tax on gasoline is simply impossible to maintain," said Lee Mannich, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state tracking devices were recently installed in 500 cars for testing this system of payment.
"It would be the best option in the long run," he said.
Call it a user fee.
Not surprisingly, this idea appeals to urban liberals, because with the help of taxes the nature of travel can be changed, for reducing road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Authorities in California expect this system to be a strategy to achieve the ambitious targets set by the laws of this state to combat global warming.
However, a Republican member of the House of Representatives Bill Shuster (PA.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said that he, too, sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Advocates of the free market group "Reason" also delighted that drivers would pay for each mile.
"It is not just a tax which will go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs of Reason.
People directly pay for what they receive.
This movement also is supported by two former Secretaries of Transportation of the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of usage payment.
The US Senate approved last year a pilot project at a cost of 90 million dollars, which would have involved about 10,000 vehicles.
But leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal due to fears of rural legislators representing voters who in everyday life often drive many miles to get to work or to the city.
A few states and cities, nevertheless, are going on that path independently.
The greatest enthusiasm is in Oregon, where participation in the largest experiment in the country has 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon be paying a tax for miles driven instead of the tax on gasoline.
In Nevada, a pilot project has been completed.
In New York, it is also seen.
Illinois employs it on a limited basis for commercial trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes departments of transportation of 17 states of the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can make these changes.
This concept has not received universal acceptance.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can track their every step.
"Concerns about the" Big Brother "and such things is a big problem," said Alauddin khan, head of the issues of strategy and management efficiency at the Department of Transportation for the state of Nevada.
It was not what people wanted.
When the tests were underway, a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: "It will be very easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices."
There is no need to create a huge technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be extended to the storage of records about the everyday movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where they are soul searching low-cost technology that would allow authorities to give the state accounting of car miles driven, but no information about the place and time.
If you can do it, Khan said, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company had been attempting to collect state taxes.
It sought to enter the booming market of automobile insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage.
But the device, which it began testing, attract transportation planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically loaded using a modem.
"People will be more inclined to do it if you do not track their speed and do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
It was a big mistakes in some of these pilot programs in the state.
There are much less expensive and less invasive ways to do it.
In Oregon designers are experimenting with the provision of various options.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they could just abandon devices, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles driven by all residents of the state.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of convenience to the public, forcing the device to do more, not less.
New York City transportation officials are seeking to develop a device which will also take payment for parking lot meters, to provide "pay as you go" insurance and gather data about speed in real time from other drivers, that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will appreciate the benefits they offer," says a document from urban design.
Some designers transport systems, however, think that all this talk about paying a huge deficit is just a distraction.
The Urban Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust fund the for highway construction by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional lump sum or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentshler, director of the commission on legislation and public relations.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about privacy, and many other things.

Pope Francis named top cardinals in february
Pope Francis in San Vozvedet named new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time of his papacy on 22 February, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the senior clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they elect popes, so Francis will appoint its first group of people who eventually will participate in the choice of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, after a cardinal reaches 80 years old, he can no longer take part in the election of the pope - it is the prerogative of the 120 "junior cardinals."
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony there will be a meeting all current cardinals, known as consistory.
"Pope Francis decided to inform us of its decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate planning of other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from all over the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices, "said that by February number of junior cardinals will likely fall.
He said that usually the Pope calls cardinals as necessary to bring the number of junior cardinals back up to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 years as he chooses.
The consistory next year will have great significance because it will be the first since the election of Francis, in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the cardinals would appoint the new pope from other regions of the world to restore the balance," he said.
In South America, home to 40 percent of catholics, but they are insignificant number of cardinals.
It will also be the first selection of cardinals since the formation of Francis' Council of Cardinals — the group of eight cardinals from around the world, which is to seek ways of reforming the church.
In the past, the popes decided everything themselves.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that "It is entirely possible" that Francis will turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before — all of it is the first time for us.
Valero said the Pope usually put in the position of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis is "full of surprises — we do not know who he will name."

The tax for foreign property owners will lead to the london bubble bursting
The treasury has carried out preliminary evaluation measures for the tax on capital gains, but awaits a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced the rate of state duty in the amount of 7% for homes costing more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in partnership, not as individuals.
Currently revenue on residential real estate in parts of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, rose from 708 million pounds in the 2012 / 13 financial year and already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, the Northwest, Yorkshire and Cambridge taken together.
Mr Cook said: "After the state duty for expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against evasion, it is very difficult to argue that taxation of expensive properties is undervalued regardless of the impact of the obsolete municipal tax system."
"But this move may cause some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy properties in London or make its current owners unwilling to sell it," he added.
The cost of first-class real estate - the top 5 – 10% of the housing market at a price — in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulkhema to Wimbledon, increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to the research company Savills, prices in central London continued to demonstrate strong growth of 5.6% in annual terms, but theses are eclipsed by active development of the "domestic market" with the surge of prices in the southwest, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%) of the city.

The next meeting of the Association of Mechanicians of the Tyumen region was held at the Yalutorovskogo automobile plant.
As part of the event, there was a presentation on the new line of production of steel pipes.
As the company told commercial director Denis Gribanov, in 2011, with the emergence of a new owner market research was held to study the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of line pipes per month.
After that it was decided to change the profile of the factory and to install equipment for their production.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of the manufactured products have been shipped.
The investment in the factory amounted to more than 120 million rubles, according to Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new mill was introduced, which helps increase the product range.
The plant produces a fine profile of pipes, which is used for tep-lichnogo farms, small forms of construction and furniture industries, as well as large forms for the construction industry.
They plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousands tons of production per year, which would be about 10 per cent of the consumption of the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another activity, the number of employees at the plant has not decreased - now it is 157 people; with the planned purchase of new equipment, the staff will increase by more than 50 employees.
In the enterprise there is a retraining of staff as well as existing experts.
Next year we plan to introduce the new unit longitudinal cutting of the steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which would reduce the cost of production, and another line, with the speed of the production of pipes up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of tubes, which are used in the housing and public utility sector.
The company aims to be close to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tyumen region in its production.
The deputy director of the department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, consulting with the leaders of manufacturing, and advised to focus on modernization of machine-building enterprises.
To this aim, they will use forms of state support for industry, which include compensation for interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
In the current year to 150 mln rubles were provided, allocated for these purposes; two-thirds of that amount has already been spent.
The latest commission, which will consider the subsidy contracts, is taking documents from companies until 15 November.
In addition, they are reimbursed expenses for the participation of local manufacturers in international fairs.
The budget for the coming year provides 150 million rubles, which can be used to offset leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 Million will be allocated to participate in trade fairs, 3 million - on an energy efficiency programme.
Falling to 72 million rubles of funds for compensation of ordered and paid for equipment, which is produced in the south of Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumova, in the long term, this form of support will be stopped, as motive for its compensation was the introduction of a tax on mining, which oil companies paid to the local budget.
Currently they do not get subsidies and direct supply obligations in the region.
In view of this, the government believes the priority is the direct support of industrial enterprises, rather than financing them through the oil industry.
The aid budget will be associated with investment projects, which will be implemented in production.
Many business executives expressed concern in connection with the situation of relationships with have been claimed.
Bailout on their Zakupaemoe equipment industry is a competitive advantage for the south of Tyumen region; with its repeal is hard to compete on price with an average strip of Russia, where there is more cheap labor.
In addition, the question of succession is unclear with the new owner of the tnk-bp company Rosneft, which has not yet placed their orders for the Tyumen enterprises.
The agreement on implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and his request for an extension was not received.
Currently, the enterprise's south area which specializes in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
There remains an open question whether taxes will come from oil extracted in the Uvatskom area in the budget of the region or if they will be paid at the registered address of the new owner of the deposits.

A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, installed given by this organisation based in the Hague to Damascus, to destroy or "make inoperable" all the means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow chemicals to mix, producing poison gas, or filling munitions with them.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of the equipment means Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
Yet Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents and weapons, including mustard gas agents and the nerve gas sarin.
This statement was made during the fighting on Thursday in the town of al-Safira, which experts say is the facility for the production of chemical weapons, as well as the location of its store, reports British-based Syrian Center for Human Rights.
The group of activists, who watched the loss through a network of activists in Syria, said that 120 296 people had been killed.
Of this number, as it was said, 61 067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
On the part of the government, said the group, 29 954 people are members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad, 18 678 are pro-government fighters and 187 - Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement were 2202 army defectors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to un estimates of 25 July, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops for several weeks fought in Safira with insurgents, many of whom are linked to al Qaeda groups.
The center said Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but did not give specific figures.
The fighting underscored the dangers faced by the inspectors on chemical weapons, perhaps within the tight schedule of their mission to wean syria from its toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is working in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was "pleased now that it had seen and verified the removal of all Syria's declared critically important means of production and mixing / filling equipment."
It added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they completed the first round of testing, having visited 21 of the 23 sites Damascus declared.
They have not been able to visit two places for security reasons, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both places were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... the objects of the program of chemical weapons, located in them, were relocated to other declared locations, which were checked."
It could not immediately be determined whether Safira was an object in one of two places, which OPCW inspectors have been unable to visit.
Syria presented a plan for the complete destruction of their chemical weapons, which must be approved by next month, by the executive committee of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
"I salute the courage and fortitude that you all have shown in the most complex mission ever attempted this organization," said Ahmet Uzyumdzhyu, the director general of the observer group, in comments published by the OPCW.
This is already the third year of civil war of the insurgents, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the government of Assad and his security forces, which consist of members of his Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
As for other events, head of the Centre Rami Abdurrahman said there was a strong blast on Wednesday at the site of Syria's air defenses in the coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.

Report: Obama election staff preferred the exclusion of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, the closest advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden's candidacy with Hillary Clinton in the voter list of 2012.
This discovery is the most spectacular sensation of the universally anticipated book by Mark Galperin and John Khaylemanna on campaign 2012 "Rates Udvoeny: Game Change 2012".
The upcoming edition of the Times received a copy of the final book and reported on Thursday night that close aides of the president held "large-scale research in a focus group and opinion polls at the end of 2011," to assess whether the exclusion of Biden help raise Ugasayushchie hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political observer of Times jonathan martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by senior officials, campaign staff and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to assess what the effect on the vote would be of selecting former Secretary of State Clinton as vice-president.
The possible replacement was a mystery, carefully guarded in election headquarters in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daly, the former head of Obama's campaign staff Jim Messinu and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that a replacement was considered.
The book "Rates Udvoeny" argues that Daly was the initiator of attempts to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship", but ultimately abandoned this step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not "significantly improve the chances of Obama."
In an interview with Martin Daly, he confirmed that the administration really considered to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I actively spoke out for the consideration of many things, and this was one of them," said Dale in the newspaper.
You must remember that at that point the president was in awful shape, so we thought: "Oh, God, what do we do?"
Although Daly described the study as a "necessary test" representative, Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that election staff invested enough in the study, to see whether this step would improve election results.
"Campaign headquarters are not spending such sums of money on surveys and focus groups if they do not consider something seriously," said Martin in the program AC 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daly whether his then-boss knew about possible replacement.
Although Daly said that he did not think the president "was aware" of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that "perhaps" Obama knew.
Martin added that "Rates Udvoeny" does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political were reported to Obama.
Cooper asked Martin, seriously whether he believes that Obama did not know about the research on excluding biden from the electoral list.
"Perhaps," Martin said.

Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
The Russian beer is in a bad mood.
According to their prikidkam, consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain at the same level, at best.
Although businessmen initially counted on growth.
The current year is unfortunate for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
Told about all this, the head of one of the largest beer companies of the country, chairman of the Union of Russian Beer Isaac Sheps at the Third Annual Conference at the Adam Smith Institute "Commodities of Daily Demand in Russia", which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has shrunk by 18 per cent, as in recent years, the country has seen a significant strengthening of the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and sales of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content, - Sheps informed the listeners.
In no country in the world are there such hard limit on the beer market, unpredictably introducing all new prohibitions, which ostensibly struggles with alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many legislative bans, designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse, do not have much influence, but nevertheless all the new initiatives regularly appear.
All the beer makers were hurt when hit with the ban introduced this year to sell alcohol at kiosks.
"We just lost 35 thousand customers," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year there are two forecasts.
The optimistic one, said Sheps: selling drinks continues at the same level.
The pessimistic one - would fall even by 2-3 per cent.
To maintain their profit, businessmen are forced to quit from varieties aimed at the mass consumer, and move to "premium" class: beer will be smaller, but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, radical consequences from falling sales with a small amount of alcohol is not in sight.
"On my observations, the level of alcohol abuse remains approximately at the same level", said vrach-narkolog Alexey Sotnekov.
True, the share of patients drinking surrogate alcoholic drinks increased, as well as those who consumed mixed drinks like "jaguars", whereas 10 years ago "beer alcoholism" prevailed.

Why would the construction of the TPU in Moscow
With each passing year, city authorities promise to arrange more transportno-peresadochnykh knots (TPU).
Until 2020, it is planned to enter into operation 255 tpu.
What actually is the project, asks our correspondent.
A couple of months ago the metro "Smolenskaya" Arbatsko-Pokrovskoy line a construction fence.
The caption read, which is construction of the project's funding node.
All this was very strange because near "Smolensk" no land transport stops and, therefore, cannot travel on him.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden ring, one must walk about 130 meters, including crossing Karmanitskiy lane.
Now the "Smolensk" is almost all finished.
Faded flower stall, demontirovan stand for newspapers, and the pavement in front of the entrance to bruschatkoy.
Here is the entire transport hub.
Transportno-peresadochnye nodes are ploskostnymi and capital - explain in the press service of the moscow department of transport.
Capital TPU while are not present.
But ploskostnye suggest the construction of parking lots, of shopping sites, hindering the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and refurbishment.
Actually, ploskostnymi TPU even do not improve, the professional blagoustroiteli of the overhaul department of the city of moscow.
The hub is not necessarily a complicated structure, explains the Director of Institute of Economy of Transport and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes a roof over one's head and the arrival board, informing about the time of arrival of transport.
Here, for example, the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a full-fledged ploskostnoy interchange junction.
Even without the canopies, but with perekhvatyvayushchimi car parks and the arrival board, indicating when pridet bus.
But in pursuit of the number of officials at TPU record all that neither popadya.
Back in 2011, City Hall planned to build at all about 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now, in plans by 2020, there are as many as 255 TPU.
Some 200 of them even promise to come to pass this year.
Although the city has the program of development of TPU, it indicated no qualitative criteria - notes Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
Report on the number of objects, but the quality of commute each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, according to the expert, there must be two: first - cutting the time of commute, second, convenience.
First of all an opportunity to change the type of transport, not going out in the rain.
In Moscow the same by arrangement of the TPU sometimes goes in exactly the opposite.
A vivid example is metro "VDNKh".
Earlier, commuter buses to the Yaroslavsky highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the exhibition.
Now they have to stop on the opposite side of the Yaroslavki Cosmonauts street.
Farther from the subway, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential homes.
The gift that residents do not want - a bus under their windows - and complained about in every possible instance.
With capital TPU in Moscow did not immediately zadalos.
The first of them started five years ago, the subway "Planernaya".
The project aims to be a model.
And really it was an example of how an interchange node, left to extreme investoram, turns into a banal shopping centre.
No, there are canopy perrony for buses, not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
True, khimkinskim trolleybus № 202 and № 203 in Moscow TPU seats will not give fundamentally.
How strange they pushed them away from the metro.
But the space under the trade more left.
One of only 32 clothing store, and generally have almost everything - from pet products to the showroom.
Well, in fact, who suddenly the from bus passengers needs to buy a new car for the road?
We have, when building overhaul TPU, somehow always turns out shopping centre.
Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the building decided to give at the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among razmechennykh on the floor of parking spaces goes boykaya trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, foreign speech and security guards, angrily poglyadyvayushchie on our photographer.
Interchange node finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact of the matter is that before the metro "Planernaya" was a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture of traffickers and everything within dui allowed on perekhvatyvayushchuyu parking peresadochnogo node.
Still, because of the high prices there are always empty.
The same ridiculousness, that the market was demolished in order to build in its place... a new Ploskostnoy TPU.
This is castling.
The "Kaluzhskaya" metro distance approach from lobby metro bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the trade center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To sit in the bus, it is necessary to pass through the shopping centre.
After 11 PM, when it is closed, one must work one's way around him, outside.
However, construction on "Planernoy" and "Kaluga" soon look like the problem.
In the middle of September, the commission approved gradostroitelno-zemelnaya mayor planning solutions for the first eight capital tpu.
Four of them will be 25-etazhnymi, not counting two or three underground lines.
The monster will grow the metro "Tushino", there will be 418,7 thousand square metres of space.
Representatives of railway stations directorate of Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU from metro, already told journalists: in future mnogoetazhkakh will contain shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials claim that storied parking zay ­ mut from one third to a half square.
Take for example the "folk" garages.
For example, the garage for 258 mashino-mest, which recently built on International street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
That means, for parking the 2.6 thousand of cars have "petrovsko-razumovskoy" need on the order of 80,000 "" squares.
This is less than a third of the makhiny, which gather there to build.
Let one or two floors will be spent on various perrony for buses.
Remains of at least 150 thousand square metres of commercial real estate.
And this, in a minute, almost two pishan county.
If capital TPU at stations and railroad station building, the rest of the site will explore metropolitenovtsy.
They also promised that there will be a lot of objects "functional purposes", including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
By the way, the Moscow Department of Property recently told journalists that they are developing a draft decree, under which investors would be able to apply for a plot at a TPU directly to the officials.
Without any competitions.
Because, they say, that the transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the "Harvard" in Boston or "Spadayna" in Toronto, asserts Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleys and trams descend underground to the metro and the distance from the approach of subway cars before the tram is only 50 metres without access to the street.
Around no unnecessary trade.
But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.
Either we will build nothing, or too otgrokhaem 25 storeys with offices and apartments.

Bombardier profit declines with falling supplies and more orders for planes
Bombardier Corporation, the Canadian aircraft and train maker, reported on thursday a net profit reduction of 15 percent under the influence of a reduced quantity of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.
Located in montreal, Bombardier also has not published any data for flight testing of its new C Series aircraft and provided no new information about whether it has implemented ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation by next September.
After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft, held about six months ago, it flew only three times, which raises questions about whether the testing phase is on schedule.
The results have failed to meet forecasts and led to the shares falling more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its estimate of "above average" to "below average" because of the belief that share growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
"Although the reduction in the number of aircraft deliveries was largely predictable, we are, of course, disappointed by the Transport Department profit figures," said Doerksen in a review of the stock market.
We believe that bombardier is geting new C Series orders as the flight test program proceeds.
Nevertheless, if in the coming months nothing is announced about new orders, we expect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the C Series family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March, and made the first flight in September after several months of delay.
However, the company's C Series orders so far are not very many: 177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to check the company's claims about fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner.
At the moment, there are 403 orders and 15 agreements with the customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane will be put into commercial operation.
Also on Thursday, executives assured analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan.
"A test model of the aircraft has not stayed on the ground longer than expected, "said Boduan during a conference call, adding that the aircraft downtime was for planned ground tests and software updates.
All manufacturers plan to test different ways.
We decided to spend the first flight and make a break for updates, and so we did.
This will also occur during the flight test programme.
The second of five test samples should take flight in the coming weeks, and all the rest will follow soon behind it, according to the company.
However, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the clients will be able to start operating C Series aircraft within the 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said that it will evaluates the commissioning and provide new information in the next few months.
"The slow pace of flight testing - though, apparently corresponds to Bombardier's domestic schedule, and reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, "said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, Bombardier's report of September 30 said net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged — 9 cents.
Gross income fell slightly - from $4.20 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The fourth in the world's second-largest aircraft maker announced that it had put 45 aircraft for the quarter, which is less than in the previous year — 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The order backlog at the Aerospace Research Department totaled $32.9 billion on September 30, less than 31 December.
"In the field of aerospace, the results are consistent with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become a troubling factor," said Boduan.
Gross income among airplane makers fell by 13 percent — to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest maker of trains, said that gross income in this sector grew by nearly 11 percent — to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion at september 30, slightly higher than 31 December.
The transport division's income negatively impacted the problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Management stated that in the fourth quarter a new development plan will be presented.
Bombardier company's shares fell to 8.5 percent — up from $4,83 at auction in the middle of the day Thursday. The company also announced that Google chief financial officer Patrick Pichett has joined the board of directors.
Brazilian company Embraer S.A., the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, said Thursday that quarterly income would be reduced by 10 percent.

Is thorium a new hope in nuclear power?
Governments in countries around the world continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
Cumbustion of hydrocarbons (where they are) negatively affects the climate.
Renewables require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy is produced without anything else, but leaves behind a lot of expenses in recycling.
Scientists recently drew attention to thorium - another radioactive element in the Mendelev system.
It is found around the world, and, according to experts, it leaves no fission byproducts that must be stored for centuries.

The Royal Commission discovers that two YMCA employees made sex crime accusations even before the charges against Jonathan Lord.
Two employees of the NSW YMCA accused Jonathan Lord, an employee of the institution's child care center in Karingbakhe, of sexual offenses against children in 2011, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence Against Children said.
But in its introductory statement, the commission was told that it "never had issues with cases of sexual abuse of children within their organization ."
Chief executive officer philip Kheyra asked about one case when the YMCA worker was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and about another case when the gym instructor at Caringbah Hall was convicted of sex crimes against children who were under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare said lawyer Gail Furniss, lawyer of the Okazyvayushchemu assistance commission, knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA, in its opening statement to the commission, also allowed inaccuracy, arguing that "there was an external review of the YMCA, that puts the YMCA directly in the firing line for the safety of the children."
The commission presented evidence that suggests that the YMCA was advised that it was the second time since the end of the four possible assessments of the quality of the results of the audit made by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the ymca when he was 21, admitted that he and higher leadership missed some things regarding Lord and also failed to provide a clear understanding to the staff of their obligations on reporting violations of the children security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys within two years of his employment at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to prison for a mimimum of six years.
However, Mr. Hare has rejected the suggestion that the YMCA corporate ethics forbade employees to report Lord's violations of children's safety.
Officers testified that they had observed violations, including that when lord was alone with the children, he personally seduced them, placed them in his lap, said that he likes one of them, and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Okvell, who was under Lord's supervision and asked for him to be trained in child protection because she was worried about his behavior, certified that she found Jackie Barnett, manager of the YMCA's children's trust at the YMCA in Karingbakhe, who was Lord's boss, "very frightening and often inaccessible."
The executive director said he does not accept the employees' explanation that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their senior management.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord prevented them from thinking about the need to report it.
Mr. Hare said he presented their opinions to the New South Wales YMCA board about what lessons there are for organizations to learn from the incident, and that theissue with Lord is not related to the provision of information from employees, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charge was accepted by the YMCA's children's trust general manager Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to obstruct evidence of corruption, but "Pereuserdstvovali" and this decision was poorly implemented.
New South Wales YMCA was not safe for children's organizations while Jonathan worked there from 2009 to 2011, said the commission's expert on problems of corruption of children, professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University.
He said that there were "serious problems" during the recruitment, selection, instruction, training, and control ofpersonnel.
The hearing postponed has been until 20 December.

With the film adaptation of the novel Guillaume Niklu, Denis Diderot boasts exclusive performances and historical detail, but it is also harder than it should have been.
The film, the events of which occurred in france in the 1760s, tells the grim story of the young aristocrat sent to the family's monastery.
When she starts to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of sadistic nastoyatelnitsy and becomes an object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never sinks to the sensation of banality or — and this is the problem.
Due to the grave solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test like Vlasyanitsy for the audience.

Ben Grinman: the tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: the New Yorker
You can safely argue that New York is a birthplace of standup comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, musical artist and entertainer Frank Fay, who worked at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the public, in a manner of speaking.
An innovation that was eventually picked up by others, more recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and coordinated by Caroline Kersh, founder of Caroline's Standup Club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, counting more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theatres.
"Most of these performers started at Caroline's, and then achieved more success, until they achieved a level when they were already too famous to perform at the club," said Kersh.
We created the festival as a way to continue to work with them.
This year, the event includes performances by Wendy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as stand-up comedy for "heroes" — an annual musical comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden where, among others, will be Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The extension of the festival has expanded the world of comedy.
A few comedians, participating in the festival this year, gained popularity unconventionally, for example, thanks to shows on small television channels like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained notoriety thanks to roles in a comedy series on the little known cable tv ("intentionally" Skabreznaya league by FX on the topic of fantasy football) and now leads his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has joined the cast of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though most of all she is known for a series of viral videos "marcel" Rakushka boots. "
And Krall and Slate, like other young comedians with original style (surrealistic pessimistic Anthony Dzheselnik, who is sly and focuses on racial themes Mau Bell), is a result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival is that David will interview hall of fame-honoree linebacker Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stanup comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in the movies, as well as the unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007 he was the leading show on TV Land called Sitdown Comedy with David Steinberg.
The interview will be held at the Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This city is surely the central element of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks on a street between two houses, and thinks: "What if I were completely broke? Perhaps I would live here."
