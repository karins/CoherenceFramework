Manufacturers of Jets feud over the width of the seats, when at stake large orders
between the leading manufacturers of aircraft inflamed the Bitter dispute about the width of a tourist class seats on the Distant flights, setting the tone for the fierce confrontation on Dubai aviation exhibition in this month.
The dispute rotates around the width of seats available on long-haul flights in economy class, whose interests are not always are in the focus of attention of the airlines, with the volume of issued to them space plays a key role in the statements of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered Sas Airbus and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week urged to introduce an industry standard, which would lead to the width of the seats at lEast 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class lounges, but its main competitor of the American Boeing says it should solve airline.
The argument is at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in sales more major versions of their twin-engine long-range aircraft, and in the event of 17 - November 21, are expected to be potentially record orders.
Integration of the rear part of the aircraft is especially the sitting, whether 9 or 10 people to a number of - takes a central place in statements about the economic efficiency of new projects “mini-airbus ”.
Boeing argues that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people on the basis of the seats in economy class more than 17 inches, placed on 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a competing version of its A350 will be transported in the economy of 350 seats on the width of the 18 inches, located on 9 in the series.
Giants aircraft manufacturing often exchanged impacts on technical issues by advertising in professional press.
And now Airbus drawn directly to the public before Airshow in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She has demonstrated, which may be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing financiers slide representing three people in the restaurant, adpressed to each other, under the name of "you would agree on is that?"
“Boeing offers long haul flights on seats narrower than the regional turboprop aircraft ", - said the head of sales Airbus John Leahy.
With the change in diet people are gaining weight, but aircraft seats are not changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the distance wide-glider Boeing 747 asked standards of modern Distant trips and abroad century weight average American men Aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the department of health of the United States.
Girth waist, the average American men of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistical data, health services of the United States.
Airbus stated that her competitor adheres to the concept of the seats in the 1950s, when the average girth waist those recently called “Reactive public ”, was already.
Airbus says ordered a study indicating that an inch in width seats improves the quality of sleep to 53 per cent.
Boeing argues figures Airbus in the sizes of seats and says that the manufacturers should not interfere in decisions on how to airlines to find balance between Tariffs and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the convenience of the salon depends not only on the width of the seats.
“all actually boils down to the provision of airlines choices and opportunities to do what they think they should make for success" said specialist Boeing on saloon Kent Craver.
They don't want US to decide for them that will bring profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers question is to increase the space on the sides, but for Suppliers it is increasingly becoming factor that may affect the profit.
For this dispute is the race for orders on aircraft, estimated at lEast $700 billion on catalogue prices in the coming decades is enough to change the American and European exports.
As the first reported in July agency Reuters, seat layout is exactly what stirs up competition in the battle between the latest state aircraft.
As Airbus and Boeing say about 20% increasing profitability in one place in their last twin-engine long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The characteristics of the Boeing are partly based on a comparison 10-local rows 777X with original 9-seater layout rows of constructive solutions 777.
The specific price reduced in comparison with 10-seater layout used at the present time.
"The reason why Boeing makes this, is to Squeeze more places and make your plane more competitive in comparison with our developments" said Kevin Keniston, head of comfort to passengers Airbus in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say, lounges with full 10-local rows for existing 777-X indicate that many passengers Prefer dense placing which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
The seat of the width of the eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view offer Airbus due to the threat from the 777-th models ", - said the specialist in the Interior salon Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the runway girl network.
Airbus and Boeing not supply chair, but offer catalogue of Suppliers from which the airline can choose.
Visitors to the world sellers Jets even carry a roulette to check the competing design.
Praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense layout salon for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus A350 offers with 10-local rows, but says that it is not sold.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications salons, offering a broad place aisle on some of their aircraft.
Without the support of the only manufacturer of another large aircraft, the experts say, its appeal to the new industrial standard is unlikely to “”, but may divert attention from the sales of the model 777X.

Concern about security in Mozambique increasing as a result of the conflict of influential people
under Wirajuda down upon them the statue Zamora Machel, the president and founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant slogans about the world on one of the rare here demonstrations.
"We want to return of the world; we want to stability" said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of their country, she replaced business suit on the T-shirt decorated inscription " we demand security ” in Portuguese, and joined in Thursday to the crowd at the capital's independence square.
Within two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo is one of the most violent clashes with the time of the conclusion of the Ceasefire more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once known rebel movement that their first white authorities Rhodesia, and then the government of South Africa's apartheid era in the framework of efforts to destabilize the independent of the government of the country.
After the Ceasefire 1992 it was an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is hardly becomes again to full-scale conflict, but recent developments forced me nervous foreign investors and local residents.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, since the opening of the huge offshore reserves of gas and coal reserves in NorthWest can attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from such companies as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling party Frelimo leading political force since 1975, and the party Renamo blaming each other in this tension.
The party Renamo argues that the government was instigator recent clashes attacked its members in the province of Sofala, traditional Outpost Renamo, 17 October.
Attacks on former insurgents then sharpened when government forces attacked base Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama is the leader of the group, told the financial times Fernando Masanga, representative Renamo.
The government blames Renamo in initiating clashes, accusing party in the attack on the Soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP, french information agency, in the environment that Mr. Dhlakama felt " a Loser, "Zachatevski use" all that is left of its forces to try to prove that he can impose the government of own decisions. "
as Frelimo as well as Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after reports that Masanga said refusal Renamo from peace agreement of 1992.
He told the financial times that meant non-observance of the agreement party Frelimo.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but very seriously" said Masanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to decrease tension, which led to a series of clashes in this year.
"This is two influential person (Guebuza and Dhlakama), confronted went head to head" said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer open university and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good Negotiator and none of them is ready to go to the required concessions.
The party Renamo, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has announced that it will be to boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt wannabe movement to make concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of the vote for Renamo declines since 1992, while the new party, the democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by the former member of the Renamo is expected to improve their performance in these elections.
Mr. Masanga says Mr. Guebuza, which should leave the post in the next year, when the end of his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want to multi-party democracy, he does not want to transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he did not want to leave the post of president" said Masanga.
It is unclear what possibilities has Renamo, but she has already launched its destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key motorway leading from the North to the South.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers North of Maputo, but includes Baru is the port that mining companies, including the Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, the Rio has suspended the use of tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened the attack on the railroad.
Masanga was evasive when he asked the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
The party Renamo wanted to “prevent the international community about the case in Mozambique are not very good, ” said Masanga.
Instability strengthened dissatisfaction with the government, but many people also care about corruption, the slow Pace of development and more frequent recently kidnapping, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media companies Mediacoop.
"People think that the responsibility for the country's future are the government and the president, who has to find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultan, participant of the demonstration, said that people just want to stability.
"no one cares about neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want to the resumption of the world, they want to free access to the roads, ” he said.

scientists have shed light on the way the movement of the tail of the dogs are connected with her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dog wag tail in the right side (from the point of view of a dog), while worried dogs pomahivaya tail mainly in the left side.
But now, scientists say that the other members of the family of the dog may notice these Subtle differences in impact tail and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara'm a neuroscientist, from Trent university, said: "it is well known that people have the left and the right side of the brain differently in shaping stimulators that cause positive or negative emotions ”.
Here we tried to look at it and from other species.
He added that the same as a person, dogs have the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and Vice Versa, and the two hemispheres play different Roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to various poilevaya tails other dogs, researchers looked for animals, when they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably, very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes head to one side, and sometimes - to another
professor Vallortigara said: “we showed the dogs video with dogs, or naturalistic version or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we can manipulate the movement of the tail, and to direct the tail more to the left or right"
when animals have seen that otherwise nothing expresses the dog was the tail to the right (from the point of view of shuffling tail dogs), they were not completely relaxed.
But when they saw that the tail was mainly to the left (again from the standpoint of shuffling tail dogs), their heartbeat uchashchalos' and they looked overanxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not believe that the dogs deliberately communicate with each other and with the help of these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from my own experience, what the movements they should worry, and what is not.
He says: "if there are several meetings with other dogs and often swerving their tail to one side is connected with more friendly behavior, while the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of the experience"
researchers say that these results can give the owners, the vet and Tamer deeper understanding of the emotions of the animal.
An expert in the field of behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow in Veterinary school Bristol university, said that it was not the first study for verifying whether the importance for dogs left and right hand.
Last year, a group of scientists from the university of Lincoln found that the dog's head turn to the left, if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if they look at one rather big dog.
And in the other scientific work of the university of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "the dogs often approached Dog-Robot when swerving its tail heading to the left, not right, instead of become overanxious, is the Opposite behavior towards Italian research ”.
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in various studies do not fully regarded animals in films or dogs-robots as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.
"While in different mammals there is sufficient evidence that the two halves of the brain are used for various purposes, many details yet to clarify and dogs is not an exception, ” he said.
However, given the ease with which can be registered their behavior, probably, very soon we will understand why their tails sometimes head to one side, and sometimes - to another.

In Siberia should not be Devoted vegan: greenhouse tomato doesn't replace soup
why are not suitable for life in Siberia, comment correspondent of RIA Novosti.
People, completely refused from the products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
Here they don't move the winter without losses for health, and no Greenhouse Tomatoes them not compensate, consider the respondents on the eve of the day of vegan Novosibirsk dietitians and doctors.
Drink oil L
the strict vegetarianism when refuse to not only from the meat and fish, but also from the milk, honey, eggs, becomes fashionable way of life.
However, dietitians sure that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict standards for food, as a minimum, unprofitable for health.
Full refusal of animal products is harmful.
In animal protein are essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for the plant.
It is necessary to include in the diet of at lEast milk or eggs, "sure dietitian marina Bohai.
It is an example of a fish, which contains an indispensable omega-3 fatty acid.
The rich them vegetable oil - a linen.
"to ingest it in the necessary for a man amounts to L drink!" - says a nutritionist.
Doctors are sure that the residents of Siberia, special attention should be given to the diet in winter.
In this season are especially is in question.
In conditions of our realities are high demand for food.
Not to freeze need excess calories.
"If people limit itself to the animal products, accordingly, this calories he arrears" says specialist.
With this agree dietician Olga Poznyak.
She adds that imported fruit and vegetables - not out.
Man better eat mostly products, which evolved in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is configured to better digestion and digestible these products.
And in the winter of people want to do not totally ok chew and hot soup or even something positie ", - explains his position of doctor.
According to her, that may have vegans, really useful various cereals, grains, beans, local vegetables, Apples, remaining in the winter, Frozen berries.
But this, it is not enough for the nutritious food.
According to the doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have in organisms level of vitamins enough only from the middle of August till the middle of September.
The full implementation of the vegetarianism in our hard natural conditions when the temperature can per day change at 30 degrees and in may of snow lies, repair.
The body for life need energy, and this is, first of all, fat, " notes medic.
Doctors say that the idea of being a vegan especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need a construction material, including in the form of amino acids.
While adhering to the vegetarianism, we give defective.
Pregnant women are also in need of high content of protein, vitamins and microelements in the menu.
"vagonki them less," sure Bohai.
Arifulina says that adult person is free to choose anything, "play with the toys that wants to".
He has already formed the body, the skeleton, organs.
And the children still must eat fully.
If parents exempt him any trace elements or amino acids, Choosing for him that he would be there, it's just the violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of those or other substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones of tomorrow will not be," she says.
All interviewed medical experts agree about the low winter as grown in greenhouses and imported fruit and vegetables.
What to bring US and grown up in greenhouses, contains fewer necessary to US microelements than (grown up) in open ground.
"The quality of products is not the", " says Bohai.
Arifulina also notes that the imported and Greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from perfect standards.
Sometimes the desire to producers gather greater harvest deals damage to quality.
"not Apples are brown on, cucumbers, quickly yellow and grow mouldy, Tomatoes tasteless and neuromate", - the leading examples of medic, adding that they probably packed tightly excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And become Suppliers not vitamins, and fiber.
With this disagrees zavlaboratoriey Siberian technical institute agricultural issues, candidate of agricultural sciences faith Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with the norms and requirements in greenhouses cultivation is full of vegetables.
If trying to drive more with a square meter, then, of course, and water will become more often and overfeed plants mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too much nitrogen fertilizer Tomatoes are growing rapidly, they are large, but the watery and salads, "she said, adding that the question of quality, first of all, depends of conscience from the manufacturer.

Russia outside of the struggle for the pollution cities cars
attempts to solve transport problems of large cities were observed in most cities of the world, starting from the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either about their conversion and expansion of roads, or about trying to reduce the demand for car trip, the number of vehicles and their use.
Widely known example Singapore, where introduced strict quota increment of the private cars and the right of their purchase is bought at auction.
His price may two to three times more than the price of the car.
European cities, including London, introduced a fee for entrance to the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, Insert the so-called green zones where permitted to enter only vehicles with certain EcoClean using the fuel of high quality (including Biofuels or electric cars).
The agency for environmental protection in Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 "Five-Year plan clean air" with the total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As told Kommersant that the director for the control of the municipal transport bureau of environmental protection if Beijing Kunsheng, the main objective of the Five-Year plan is the reduction of the leading air pollutants at 35% to 2017, the increase of the number of private cars to level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as an increase in no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle.
According to the agency, now vehicles in Beijing is responsible for 22,5% of the total air pollution.
Among the key measures program is limiting the use of motor transport, as well as introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city measures "green Five-Year plan" include accelerated in comparison with the rest of the country, the transition to ens fuel, introduction of the local system eco-standards and labelling of vehicles and fuel, restricting entry cars in the central part of the city, the prohibition of the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, creation of complementary financial programs replacement of old cars in hybrid or electric cars), development of electric transport (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high speed).
Among Automotive innovation Beijing applies also to ban all private rental on movement within the fifth transport ring (only in the capital of the PRC them six) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the license plate sign of the vehicle), and also the issue of registration signs for cars on the basis of the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).
According to the current government programme "environmental protection in 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (in 2012 them was 138).
According to the data of the ministry of natural resources, in 2011 on "mobile sources" there were 41% of all emissions of polluting substances into atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars in ten times higher than the industrial and in St.Petersburg - in nine times.
In the russian federation, while only begin to wonder about the possibilities of a restrictive regulations of cars in the Streets of cities.
The director of the institute of economy of transport and transport policy HSE Mikhail Blinkin believes that the administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for car trip is obviously unpopular, they can be accepted only if their utter universality.
In the case of Moscow is a unique problem related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two cluster weak sensitive to any regulatory influences - service and personal vehicles, as well as cars "privileged users", the total number of not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of fleet of Moscow).
The other day urbanists from the centre of expertise in St.Petersburg prepared a study where is the balance of city territories between residential buildings, area of pavement and the number of vehicles.
The main conclusions of researchers: city centre with roads in two times less than the required, and most motorists living in the center, not used cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking Lots or simply on the Streets.
As a result of the proposed to build not parking, and storage of vehicles, not to expand, and reduce the road (so that the Streets were more friendly for pedestrians), and also to limit the use and the placement of personal transport within the territory of the security zone of the historical centre (the total territory of about 3212 ha covering a number of central districts of the city).

the suffering of his father and many of his fellow countrymen, Bolle became determined to do anything else with it.
In the past year, Dr. Georges Bolle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He became a doctor and works vascular surgeon in the central hospital of Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-commercial organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips in countryside on weekends to provide free medical aid.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers provided assistance almost 32 000 people.
Almost every Friday he and even up to 30 people stuffed in Vans bind to the rooftops of medical supplies and go cross-country to visit in need of assistance to the village.
Not always accompany them Luck.
Not once they had to push the car through the river and the dirt.
But when they come, their face, as these heroes: this holiday with songs and dances and the best Rooms which can only offer local residents.
Free medical care in these villages is a cause for celebration and Bolle with its broad smile and infinite energy more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning the brigade starts to receive hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people in each trip ", - said Bolle.
They come from all over the landscape within 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics of the day off provides a variety of medical services.
Many people get treatment of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and Sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated points or free birth certificates, the documents necessary for the school, which many poor families simply can't afford.
In the evenings, the brigade is simple operation under a local anesthesia.
Operations, as a rule, are held in the building of the school, municipality, or in the house; after the procedure patients get up and go to the recovery zone to make room for the next person.
Using the generator for lighting operating and sanitary processing equipment, Bolle and its volunteers work until the early hours of the morning Sunday.
This back-breaking Pace, but the determination of the brigade usually helps to maintain village musicians.
"They all night beat the Drums, so we were awake and continued to work, ” said Bolle.
On Sunday, the brigade members are sent back to the city, the weary, but Proud of his work.
This group consisting of kamarounski doctors and foreign medical students, held 700 free operations during the past year, and they know that their assistance may be of great value for those whom they help.
One man explained that the received them free operation of the treatment of tube to enable him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family" said the man.
In addition to these clinical methods in the weekend and work at the hospital surgeon Bolle also works in the night of private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
This second work, according to him, provides 60% financing his nonprofit organization; the remaining funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he Sleeps ", - said Kathy about Malley, a student of the second course drexelbrook university in Philadelphia, volunteer in group Bolle.
He always either in the hospital, or trying to earn money for the organization to continue this campaign.
For future doctors and nurses, such as the Malley coming from the United States and Europe to join Bolle in the implementation of its tasks, it is an opportunity to practice that they would never have received at home.
"We have had the opportunity to assist on operations, where we helped remove spots of blood or keep tools for doctors Bolle ", - said about Malley.
Being student-sophomore, you would never have received such a possibility in America.
Student volunteers will usually pay for their travel in Cameroon, often coming with donated Medicines.
But the arrival in Yaoundé their Meals, transport and training pays Bolle.
"is he a hero, without a doubt, ” said about Malley.
He gives his life of this organization, and his desire to help people Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bolle almost constant workload of the work is not hard to handle.
Help to live a happy life to Others, to perform this to his father promise is what brings him a great Joy.
"I am so happy when doing this work, - said Bolle.
-- and I think about my father.
I hope he sees that I do.
I do it to people laughed to reduce their pain.
Go to the site ASCOVIME and see how you can help.

For "the russian mafia" in the US finally take hold a new name - "fraternal circle"
this week the black list "Russian mafia" in America was replenished by the new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury introduced in "fraternal circle" three representatives from Russia, the two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis.
One of the russians was famous singer Grigory LEPs, of which the United States is suspected of transporting money for the members of the group.
All in all, the black list of the USA, 22 persons involved in "the brotherly circle", and six affiliated with him organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts express doubt that it exists.
"The statement of the Bratsk circle more like an attempt to combine separate criminal groups" said earlier, an expert on organized crime and professor of the university of New York mark Galeotti.
In his opinion, "fraternal circle" reflects the popular perception "Russian mafia".
"I never met anyone in russian law enforcement authorities or anywhere else, who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization," quotes Mr. Galeotti American center for research on corruption and organized crime.
With Mr. Galeotti agree and professor at George Mason university Liz Shelley.
"If they work together, then it is more like a criminal network, but not organization", - leads her words centre for research on corruption and organized crime.
In the middle of last year, mark Galeotti suggested that "fraternal circle" unites more close russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as the Grandfather Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
So, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zecharia Kalashov, joined list in 2012, was closely linked to the Grandfather Hassan, and another participant list, Temuri vice-chancellor, had his Grandfather Declare Hasan nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr Galeotti notes that some individuals and have no relation to Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them feature more general financial and criminal interests, for example the delivery of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal around the inclusion in the "fraternal circle" Grigory Leps - a favourite singer of the president of Russia Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we hope that we get from our American partners more detailed information, in connection with the decision was made, why does it in such lists made" said the head of state spokesman Dmitry Peskov.
In any case he (LEPs) is a russian citizen.
As well as the interests of all the citizens of the russian federation, his interests will be protected.

Children must study the myths and legends as model lifestyle ”, says the author.
Legends about the Torah could show that “brute force could not defeat the refined cunning ", and the legend of king Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths are “too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools ”, Crossley-Holland stands for“ careful selection ” conforming to the age of the texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education, ” he said.
I stood for the introduction of them in a training program twentyyears.
He added that "excessive moralizing ” of the authors and faculty“ beats interest ” in children, and the main idea of “sublimated ” in the fascinating history.
Crossley-Holland, who translated “Beowulf ” with Anglo-Saxon language, but also wrote“ collection of Norwegian myths ” for publishing house penguin and “British folk tales ”, said:" you have, of course, may be intentions, but you better keep them with him. "
maybe the big difference between adult author, write for adults and adults author, write for children, is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to the end of the happy, but it is necessary to have an innate understanding of good and evil.
And this should be sublimated; Revealed through the story, not clearly formulated.
The old principle: show, not tell.

Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks for the main drivers the fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
First of all, this is the crisis of non-payments unsecured consumer credit and the mass of workers.
Our main concern is not what growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.
At the present time it is completely consumption, which is almost not ease up Revolutions" said the chief Economist at Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens column, presenting yesterday quarterly report for investment bank in the russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
If inflation in 6% he will be able to provide the future demand for about the current level, expect in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of russian companies is falling, however, most likely, they will optimize expenses on staff.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if the wages rise by 10%, the GDP - only 2%" said Mr. Column.
The company faced with the reduction of profitability.
If she doesn't grow up, this may lead to dismissals, and the growth of unemployment.
Not to raise the salaries of the russian business can't, says chief Economist of the Barclays capital in Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historic lows, competition for workers high.
To attract employees with hand or to keep current employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia support ­ themselves and very rapid growth potrebiteley.
According to Mr. Box, because of the extremely high rates on consumer Loans multiplier effect on the economy of the country this type of crediting does not provide.
"good for the economy of potrebiteley we no saw money does not go to the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments" said Economist.
But the problem is different - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of overdue unsecured Loans.
Them take mostly books people who have nothing to offer in the software.
Interest on the loan high.
As a result, they often fail to return " said Mr. Column.
However the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is possible crisis of non-payments unsecured Loans.
The director of the banking institute of HSE Vasily Solodkov now sees signs looming banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to cheap resources, which have the prior, were forced to raise funds of the population under the high interest rates.
In response, the state took on a war and started to cut interest rates, - continues to Economist.
Small credit organizations can not to issue Loans under the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margin.
If the state is not refuse to dumping, Russia is in a banking crisis believes Vasily Solodkov.
Deprivation of licenses of several banks in recent weeks Economist considers as the harbinger of mass collapse.
"The state themselves with this situation can not do it: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for systemic crisis," warns the head of the institute.
But consumption growth will slow and without a crisis of non-payments, believe in the prestigious, "because of the refusal of indexing wages of officials and military, laid in the current version of the project budget.
Partially blow to the consumption will freeze reduced Tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, the decrease in the inflation).
But only partially: if investments not grow (and the prerequisites for this while are not present - see reference), consumption growth is slowing, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays capital has yet to see the prerequisites for the realization of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still falling oil prices," he says.
He estimated that the russian economy will Shrink by oil price below 90 USD per barrel.
In Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is unable to cut interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical situation: inflation fell, and banks began raising rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the central bank, the transition to the companies who targeting inflation " said Clemens column.
The policy of the central bank to market rates are not affected, only affects the Interbank lending rates.
"for the central bank is the failure of all hopes," appreciated Clemens column.
Money received at auction, the central bank, the banks are not for lending to the economy and to manage their liquidity
as soon as the reduced rate, just changing the exchange rate, it means that the funds are trying to go to the speculation against the ruble.
"sooner or later, the central bank will understand that this strategy is not working" said Mr. Column and recalled that put the ruble in "floating" the state plans to the end of 2015.
But will have to either make it before, or to raise the rate of the central bank (5.5%), he said.
He estimates, the ruble is artificially overvalued by 10%.
The ruble only one road - weakness, "concludes the expert.
But if the central bank provides in finansista even the shadow of a doubt that the elimination of currency corridor is not part of the policy on the weakening of the ruble, it can break the ruble is much stronger.

FAA: “air passengers can now use the Gadgets to planes (but not calling from a mobile phone).
Air travelers can use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, - according to the long-awaited new Guidelines, published on Thursday, the federal aviation administration.
But passengers should not expect that things will happen immediately.
How fast this change is realized, will vary depending on the airline, said the administrator of the FAA Michael Huerta at the press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA, as their planes meet the new Guidelines and that they maintained their textbooks for the members of the flight crew and rules for the installation of devices, to meet the new Guidelines.
FAA stated that it has already been plans from some airlines to expand the use of Portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines, which have already presented plans.
"depending on the plan could we endorse the increased use of electronic devices very soon, ” stated FAA.
At the present time the passengers are obliged to disable your smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as soon as the door aircraft is closed.
They do not need to restart them until the plane will reach a height of 10,000 feet and captain will not give “good ”.
Passengers must turn off your device again when the aircraft is reduced for planting, and do not include them until the plane is on the earth.
In accordance with the new Guidelines, airlines, whose planes adequately protected from electronic interference, may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off and landing and taxiing, stated FAA.
Most new airliners and other aircraft, modified so as to passengers could use wi-fi at high altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the association of professional cabin crew, welcomed the change.
"After the new policy will be successfully implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to do this), this will be the win-win option ", - said Glading.
We openly tired feel “duty by school ”, when it comes to this issue.
But the connection to the internet for surfing, exchange of electronic letters, text messages or the download of data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, agency reported.
Passengers will be invited to switch your smartphones, tablets, and other devices in a mode of the aircraft.
Thus, still no “words with friends ” - intellectual gaming, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from the plane of the airline American airlines for refusing to switch off the device at the time when the plane was at the gate.
And more severe devices such as laptops, still have to lay in baggage department, because they can hurt someone if will fly around the salon.
Calls from your mobile phone in flight will also remain prohibited.
Regulatory powers to phone calls are owned by the federal communications commission, not the FAA.
FAA can lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
in the past month mark Rosenker from the national council for the safety of the transport, national security expert transportation CBS news, said that the cell phones are still considered risk.
“cell phones -- this is really the problem, not only because of potentially they can create obstacles for navigation devices, but we know the FCC, that they can create obstacles for towers cellular, when the aircraft is in the air" said Rosenker.
Sectoral advisory committee, the FAA to study this question, recommended that last month that the government has allowed more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the growing pressure on the FAA to easing of restrictions on the use of them.
Critics such as Democrats Senator from the state of missouri Claire MacAskill claim that for prohibitions, there is no good reason, security related.
The restrictions also becomes more difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become commonplace.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to switch off your device.
The FAA to limit the use of passengers electronic devices in 1966, in response to the reports of interference for navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to wear a FM-radio - high-tech Gadgets that time.
New airplanes are much more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation aircraft, but they also are developed and approved by FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airline offers passengers using wi-fi at cruising altitude already for several years.
Planes, modified for wi-fi-systems, also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of has adapted for a wider use of electronic devices according to the new Guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices usually radio emitting a much lower power than the previous generation devices.
Devices for reading electronic books, for example, will only minimal signals at swiping pages.
But the signals are becoming more powerful when devices are uploading or send data.
Among those who sought to easing of restrictions on the use of passengers of electronic devices, was the company Amazon.com.?
In 2011, representatives of the company have downloaded a airliner their devices for reading electronic books kindle and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the advisory committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings about the order is the use of devices of any risk.
Douglas Kidd from the national association of air passengers, said that considers interference from devices real, even if the risk of minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only separate messages Pilots confirming that the devices can create obstacles for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that allowed the FAA Pilots require passengers disable the device during landings on devices in limited visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a Sensible step towards the passengers, who now use a lot of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledges that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with the security and protection" said Roger Dow, general director of the tourist association of the United States.

The new antinikotinovoe vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure
scientists have developed antinikotinovoe vaccine that would deprive the process of smoking Cigarettes pleasure.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Need further tests before the trials on people that will take a few years, but professor Ronald crystal of the medical college of well Cornell in New York, said that the first results encouraging.
“we hope that this strategy of vaccines may finally help millions of smokers who tried to throw, having tried all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine dependence sufficiently strong to overcome it with the help of these modern means of ", - said the professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains harmless virus, which was designed to carry the genetic information for the production of antinikotinovoe antibodies.
The virus infects selectively liver cells, which then began to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies stalk any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing the negative them before they reach a brain, Preventing the receipt of a smoker nicotine strike.
The tests vaccinated mouse, which subsequently gave nicotine, continued to his normal activities.
And the mouse, which were not given a vaccine, “our effort," and this is a sign that nicotine got to them of the brain, "the researchers said.
These experiments are described in the journal science Translational medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed, because they contain antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections needed to do so often that they are expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccines will probably be much lower, because it transforms liver cells in the factories of antibodies.
Professor crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it would give the children before they'll have the desire to try a cigarette, Preventing nicotine dependence.
But more likely that it will be used smokers to quit smoking.
"They know that if they start smoking again, they will not receive from this fun because of nicotine vaccines, and that can help them get rid of this habit, ” he said.
Scientists say that the results were interesting, but warned that requires additional research.

Frontier airlines plans to charge up to $100 per hand baggage, and $2 for coffee or these Pops, although their announcement on Wednesday, saying that passengers can leave your bank.
The new fee for hand baggage applies to bags in the top of the luggage compartments, however small bags, placed under the seat, will remain free of charge.
Frontier said that will charge $25, if the fee is to be paid in advance, and $100, if traveling will pay only once at the gate.
A spokeswoman for the frontier Kate about Malley said that the fee of $100 must make passengers take care about the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
Airlines began to charge for the first and second bag real in the baggage in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid these charges, wave as much as will be able, in hand baggage, placed in upper luggage compartments, because of what these compartments often do not have enough space.
Fees is one of the ways to make the passengers board less on board.
About Malley said that this new collection is actually not for making money.
The fact is that the most loyal clients frontier claim that find a place in the top of the luggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger waiting in the queue at the flight frontier might be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.
About Malley said that changes to procedures on the website and at the check-in desk frontier designed to ensure that the passengers will know about collecting before they get to the gate.
The new collection of frontier for hand baggage will not apply to summer, although the date not already installed.
Passengers are often complain of fee for baggage and other charges, but airline them love.
They claim that the processing of baggage is worth the money, and the passengers, who need this service, should pay for it.
Many on wall street consider adding the luggage fees sign that airlines charge enough money to cover costs on air travel after several years of losses.
However, most of them are not touched fees for hand luggage.
Spirit airlines Inc. Has introduced the first collection for hand baggage, three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant air later followed their example.
The only other airline with such collection is the Hungarian Wizz air, said consultant on airlines Jay Sorensen, which closely watching extra charges.
In his evaluation of the report from December 2011, the fee for hand baggage, brings the spirit of $50 million per year.
Sorensen, former chief executive of the MidWest airlines, recently flew flight spirit, and it was interesting that he finds out at the gate, when the passengers encounter with an unusual collecting spirit in hand baggage.
“the process of landing was the smooth from those that I saw in his career in the airlines, ” he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and landing was rapidly"
frontier should also for spirit in respect of the charge of $2 for coffee, tea, these Pops or juice.
Frontier stated that the passengers who get these Pops or juice can leave yourself all bank and that topping coffee will be provided free of charge.
She still will be giving free water.
Us Airways a short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but has rejected this seven months after passengers began to complain and no other major airlines has not followed their example.
The initiative frontier presented on the payment for the hand baggage when passengers not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last resort to attract customers to your website.
Airline pay online sellers tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for every one ticket.
This gave all airlines incentive to encourage the passengers to buy tickets directly from them, and not to apply to the tourist online agency.
However, frontier went further all in this area.
In September, she began to give two times less miles flying passenger often our clients, who have bought tickets through the online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut premium number of miles to 25 per cent of the miles of the trip.
So, a trip to 1000 miles from the frontier, bought the online travel agency, would get 250 miles.
In addition, customers can choose place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the website of the frontier.
The frontier is the base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but her business is reduced and becomes unprofitable.
Revenues decreased by 9 percent, and flight opportunities decreased almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results, published on Wednesday, the Parent company of republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to improve finance frontier in the framework of the sale of the airline.

Putin made of impunity for his friend of Assad
and now - news because of the ocean, namely - from Syria, where, as it became known to US today, Israel has a blow to the missiles of production, which reportedly were intended "Hezbollah"
today, Syria has an important condition is to destroy by November 1, their production of chemical weapons.
This was done under the agreement mediated by Russia and allow the United States not to conduct military operation to which they closely came this summer.
Read more about the weapons and about what it means to the Syrian president, will tell our main international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said that Mr Assad's regime will be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August from poison gas.
And punishment come.
But not in the form of American bombing, and in the form of a transaction, which had a friend of Assad - Vladimir Putin.
Syria will refuse from their chemical weapons by the middle of the next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria knocked out the factory for the production of chemical weapons.
More long-term and hard task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to him.
As we understand, it's about a thousand tons.
Before Washington said that Mr Assad's days are numbered.
I think Asad must go.
The question is not whether this will happen, and in fact, when it happens.
He no longer legitimate and must go.
But Assad remains.
And feels more confident.
His forces continued to use the artillery rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and badly equipped.
His people were forced to leave their homes, many go hungry.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement about the chemical weapons called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors was awarded the Nobel peace prize, and the Assad was impressed with the person, ready for cooperation.
Today in Washington the USA Ambassador in Syria had to answer the tough questions.
When a child die from hunger, his mother is unlikely to more easily from what he did not killed with the help of chemical weapons.
Assad as long as it is.
And changes the weapon on power.

Parents intersexuals children can choose “an indefinite Paul"
Germany was the first European country, which recognized the third floor in children born with internal reproductive organs of intermediate type.
The newborn will no longer have to assign a male or female sex.
The new law does not require from parents to call any Paul of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as "undefined" or "unidentified" in their evidence about the birth.
The purpose of the law was to pressure from the parents, who can take hasty decisions about operations for assigned gender newborn and counter discrimination intersexuals people.
One intersexuality people, according to the BBC, said many years later: "I'm not a man and a woman"
I stay created doctors patchwork product with bruises and scars.
Approximately one of two thousand children, born annually, is neither a boy or a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of approximately 60 pathological states that fall under the diagnosis “human sexual development ” is a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, HANAGAMI (ovaries or testes) or unusual developed internal reproductive organs.
Wallace Simpson, probably, was intersexuals.
Gender identity is still insufficiently understood, but most experts in the United States said that, if the floor can not be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign to it than to wait and to track the psychological and physical development of the child before the surgery, if at all this happens.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, which specializes in the problems of gender identity, said that the new german law "sounds like a good idea"
Intersexuals children creates Ethical dilemma.
"some people have life-threatening disturbances, which require the surgical intervention, however, the majority of children them is not present, ” he said.
You can assign to the floor without operation and then see how developed personality.
The science of how the child will develop a gender identity, not very precise.
Nobody can answer questions about why it is happening.
It's like the mystery about why people are a homosexual.
The report, sent to the European commission in 2011, describes intersexuals people as different from transgender or transgender because of their condition relates not to gender, and by their biological structure, which is not only not to man's nor the female sex, and a typical for both at the same time or not is not for one of them.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary sexual features, such as the muscle mass distribution of the scalp, chest and physique; the primary sexual features, such as reproductive organs and the genitals, or in the structure of the chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gives a general idea of discrimination faced by intersexuals and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as on the level of harassment, violence and crimes on grounds of prejudices.
The boys with gender needs now there is a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to male or female or "the third floor ” in its official documents.
In June, 52-year-old resident Australia norri May-Welby became the first in the world the man acknowledged “asexual ", defended in a court of law on the preservation of“ Vague "sexual status for life.
According to the ministry of internal affairs, in german passports will be the third denotation in addition to m and f -- x, i.e. Intersexuality.
In the neighboring France gender issues still cause contradictions, according to a news release on channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this pronounced Catholic countries signed the petition for exemption "gender theory ” of school textbooks.
The American website Catholic online also expressed disagreement with the german law, writing that "in the situation, when the world is involved in a new state where the floor is a matter of choice, and the sexual activity -- no, we flip another two pillars of civilization ”.
A mother of the newborn from Maryland also reported the website baby zone, that she would have to children installed the floor at birth.
“raise the child is quite difficult and without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the floor of the child," she said a website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, of children born with the male and female reproductive organs, called hermafrodite is named beautiful Greek god, who had the characteristics of both Sexes.
And yet only ten years ago the medical community perceived gender as a sheet of paper on which you can just delete, and then again to draw.
But now many dispute Ethical reasons for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and the doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will be assigned to him the floor when will grow.
“in the middle of the 20th century, it was called" pressing the Psychiatric case " said Drescher.
When children are born, you are not called the psychiatrist - you called surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to deal with children with genitals intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John mani from at Johns Hopkins university, who believed that gender easy to change.
He introduced to appeal the term “gender identity" and argued that the signals of the environment, including social - how parents are raising a child, - interact with genes and hormones of the child in determining whether a person is considered to be a man or woman.
But in the one case of 1966, known as the “John/Joan ”, his theories are in question.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during the unrestrained circumcision, fully castrating child by removing also his testicles, and raise it as a girl.
“mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but this was not the case, ” said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years, he became a boy and a married woman.
But in 38 years he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors still "apply this model ”.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the internet, people who survived these operations on a sex change, said about yourself, "with the outcome"
such was the case and Jim Bruce,, a writer from the state of Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY, but genitals intermediate type.
The doctors could not determine precisely there was whether he has a big clitoris or small penis and were convinced that he would never be able to live a full life ” “men.
However shortly after his birth in 1976 the external sexual organ and testicles Bruce were surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl.
He went to female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I know that I am not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was Unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years he was appointed vaginoplasty.
But being in depression and realizing that something is wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out it was awful.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which does not give his body to produce enough testosterone for normal development of genital organs.
Having got to know the truth, he became a man getting testosterone injections and removing his chest.
Operation made his fruitless.
Today he upholds the other in the organization called interface project, trying to lead normal perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California law association story for informed choice, concerned that the german law “urges earning shortcuts and stigma"
"many activists are concerned that the german law will encourage parents make hasty decision and to give the child" an indefinite sex "," she said.
We are afraid that it will contribute to the intervention.
We believe that it is better to give a male or female sex, and then wait.
But we haven't seen would behave this law, so all we can do is to build assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law, because "it allows adults make choice in favor of the third floor"
“adult people should have the opportunity to make their own decisions on formal sex," she says.
The german law implies appropriation of its birth.
This battle, in which little children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions regarding their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Barats, mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh, has a daughter with violation of sexual development and which helps to hundreds of other people in a support group, said that the german law " support ” as parents and children.
Daughter Barats, Katie, born with male chromosomes, but it is a violation of sexual development called “the syndrome of full dead to actually androgen ”.
Since its androgen receptors incorrect work, the Katie developed female signs.
She has the vagina, but not the uterus and ovaries.
Now, in 29 years, Katie married and passes studies on psychiatry at the university of Pennsylvania.
In Spite of the fact that she Barren, she hopes to become a Parent through the adoption or gestational surrogacy motherhood methods.
The law gives parents time, not to take any hasty decisions for themselves" said Barats.
He gives them the time to make any analysis and understanding of the situation, as well as the period of time before they write “male ” or“ female ”.
In this case you in order - grow baby love child.
You have a child, and you feel Joy.
We don't need to hastily to do the operation that irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in solving and eliminates the excitement that drives the parents, because they do not feel that doing the right thing," she said.
In the end he decides what Paul him or her more comfortable -- and it's wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.

The cry of despair Voter Obama
I voted for president Obama twice, sharing a hope for the opportunity to change
he says that Obama has allowed obstructionism Republicans overshadow the commendable efforts.
Obstructionism can not justify the problems with the website the Reformed Obama health systems, attack UAVs
memoirs of the Obama campaign 2008 are sad reminder that could be
Nathaniel P. Morris, a student of the second course of medical faculty of Harvard university.
I read terribly sad book in these days.
I thought that this book will inspire me during the Gloom in the second year of the medical faculty and restore in me a sense of hope.
It's called "impudence to win," and it's Memoirs of the presidential campaign Barack Obama 2008.
When I finish the evening to write reports on my patients and go to bed, this book returns me at the time when the policy was millions of people, and performance can capture the spirit.
Victory in the elections was an impressive and leading news programs do pause for understanding of this historic moment.
My classmates cry of Joy, and my parents who guarded all the papers that only they could find.
In the white house had come a young team strategists, and people were ready to change.
At the time of entry of the Obama administration office in 2008, its level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present represents a rude awakening as pulling of your dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism, they seem to be a Distant memory, sad reminder about lost opportunities.
In the years that have passed since I lowered his first ballot, changes really occurred.
It was then that I even could not imagine.
I give Obama credit for its large and diverse achievements, the adoption of the law on available medical assistance to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the abolition of the rules of the "don't Ask, don't tell", killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism blocked too many attempts to promote our country forward: immigration reform, choice of public health and the closure of the base in Guantánamo among Others.
But after the number of times, when I got on the side of the Obama administration, protecting it before colleagues and peers, I have ended explanations that I can provide.
I reached the point of political despair.
Obstructionism the Republicans can't explain the permission to wiretap foreign leaders or drawing of the strokes drones on innocent children in other countries.
He can't explain the collected data on the private life of the americans, the national security agency or prosecution of "whistle-blowers", clarify the misconduct of the government.
He can't explain the murder of a U.S. Citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or non-compliance with the limits of public finance and expenditure during the presidential campaign.
He can't justify the findings of the report, which states that applied white house efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive... Since the Nixon administration ".
And in the last time he can't justify what fails to develop simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care.
I don't know that I should have been expected.
Should I was at the age of 18 years to understand that leadership may contradict the political campaigns, which precede him?
It is obvious, that the work on the post is not predictable programme of action, because our public dialogue will form the opposition political party and such random events as massacre in Newtown.
Yet for all the listed me examples above, you can see that they are largely were their own choice of administration.
And this is what bothers me most of all.
Once again I voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
This exhibition will promote Romney was a strange and gross alternative, it seemed that he can not decide on its own policy or views.
I thought that in his second term of Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections meets expectations, about which we heard for such a long time.
However, when this week rating Obama dropped below 45%, to return in 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.
It makes me pine for many promises that vanished.
This week I read the books, which describes how Clinton was Obama deafening defeat on primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting on the analysis of the causes of failure, he told his employees that they should go back to normal and remain faithful to their purpose.
"I want we sent our appeal," he said.
- we have to remember about who we. "
it's been five years, Mr. President, and I entirely agree with you.
Expressed in this comment opinion belong exclusively Nathaniel Morris.

Recognition of the national security agency reinforce paranoia corporations in respect of state surveillance
warm day in the end of August the helicopter german police flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the federal service for the protection of the constitution (BfV), services of domestic intelligence Germany, his Assignment was photograph the roof of the building of the United States, which is located less than 5 km from the European central bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say BfV hoped to find antenna eavesdropping devices, and these actions led to the negotiations between the United States and the ministry of foreign affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James clapper, the director of national intelligence of the United States, in September again assured that the United States will not use the opportunities for foreign intelligence "for the theft of commercial Secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to improve their international Competitiveness or to increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden - contracting employee became the unmasker - started to publish their Secrets of the treasury of the U.S. Intelligence, European governments and heads of companies are not sure whether you can believe the director-general on the word.
Reports that the national agency of the U.S. Security monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and received access data stored in the cloud providers of the U.S., including Google and Yahoo, raised paranoia corporations, caused by observation of the state, to new Heights.
The last straw was the news that the phone Chancellor Angela Merkel was tapped, probably, about ten years.
If the most influential person Europe may become the target, then, of course, potential targets are and business leaders.
Snowden made evident intensive collaboration between the intelligence services of the United States of America and companies.
I think it is likely that this data is used with the mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up ", - says Oliver Grun, president of the association of BITMi, which represents the small and medium IT-company Germany.
German companies are convinced that the United States now are almost the same risk, as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to the research, published in July consulting agency EY.
In all the documents, disclosed Mr. Snodename, nevertheless, until now, no evidence that the USA gave commercial Secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Policy expressed concern that the EU lacks certain opportunities in the field of information technology and the internet, and expressed the opinion that he should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical.
Someone in parliament Germany says that we should create german Google.
I can just close your eyes and slowly to open them again...
"This is not an option" says Hasso Plattner, president of the german the supplier company software for sap business.
If there is a necessity for the powerful European it, should not allow her to die for more than 20 years ago.
All subsidized by in Germany: from coal to the rental and Farmers.
Everything except the it industry.
And nevertheless coverage and technical development agencies for espionage, became famous thanks to the Revelation Snowden, was a shock for some companies, who thought that the Biggest risk surveillance is China.
A big shift takes place in the cloud technologies, where the heads of European companies better realize that data stored in the United States, are located in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey carried out by a trade association of cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. Participants refused plans to use services of staying in the United States have the provider after exposing the American programs for intellectual analysis of data prism.
Jim SNAb, one of the executive directors of the sap, said: “we see that consumers asking a question not arise a year ago, namely: where are my data and can you guarantee that they physically will remain in the jurisdiction ”.
Many of the german leaders claim that the last message is only a confirmation of the fact that they already know: powerful states want to steal them the most valuable Secrets, and, hence, these data should be protected at all costs.
What's happening economic espionage is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“it was the subjext of the discussion of the many years and not substantially changed in the current debate" said Kurt side, chief executive officer of the chemical company BASF.
Americans spying for US on the commercial and industrial level, and we also for them spy, because it is in our national interests, to protect our businesses.
The leaders of corporations are usually do not like to boast of the retaliation, which they have taken as this may provide the advantage of the enemy.
In large companies have long been assimilated thought that take free USB drive at the exhibition or leave your laptop unattended in a hotel room is at lEast thoughtless.
Ulrich Hakenberg, member of the board of directors of the company's Automotive Audi, says that for many years, this is standard practice is to collect mobile phones before meetings of the board, so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The federal service for the protection of the constitution of Germany recommends that the heads of companies to consider the use of simple prepaid mobile phone during travel abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
A prepaid mobile phones later are discarded.
Nevertheless, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to intrusion and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leaders in the world market in your particular niche.
"small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, employees and financial resources to effectively protect corporate Secrets from unauthorized access," warns the report BfV.
The United States warn their own companies on the economic espionage by other countries.
National intelligence summary of the USA in February placed France together with Russia and Israel in the second series of violators, who are pursuing hacking skills for economic intelligence, after China, according to the Washington post.
Member of the board of directors of the prestige of the german company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “French worse all ”.
Bernard sarcini, a former head of the french agency the inner intelligence DCRI reportedly said in an interview this month: " service perfectly know that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spying for their allies. "

Agency "Rosbalt" status of media for indecent abuse
on October 31, Moscow city court ruled to Void the license on the registration agency "Rosbalt", "writes" ribbon ".
On the deprivation of the agency status media insisted Roskomnadzor - for the systematic and gross violations of the law on the mass media.
In the course of the process was created unpleasant precedent: the court considered possible close media, in fact, denying publication in the right to nominate counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
CJSC "Rosbalt news agency" was established in St.Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years the agency has opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional offices.
The agency has offices in the countries of the former Soviet union.
Since 2001 "Rosbalt" has developed and has functioned as a federal information-analytical agency.
By the middle of the 2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.
The "Rosbalt" has always held a rather specific niche: the kernel exclusive publications of the agency were (and are still) notes with reference to sources in the law enforcement agencies.
The talks about the proximity to the publication of force structures continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that the "Rosbalt" had an extensive database of sources in different departments, in favor of such assumptions told that in the chapter of the project was Natalia Chaplin - wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
In this role Chaplino in the leadership of the "rosbalta" until the end is not clear: often it is called "the head of the project".
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, chief editor - Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times "Rosbalt" not involved in the ratings of federal media - neither by the coverage, nor in the audience.
In October, 25th agency took place in the rating of attendance of sites of russian mass media on version LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, average daily audience site Rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials for the past five months - notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the Soloist of the group "the king and the Jester" massacres in the Moscow Birulevo.
The conflict "Rosbalt" with Roscomnadzor began in July 2013, when entered into force of the amendments to the law on the mass media, prohibited journalists indecent abuse.
Agency found banned vocabulary in two published on the website of the agency videos ("djigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Abominable things riot oil rigs").
Further hand described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of discovered videos accused "Rosbalt" in the brutal and systematic violations of the law on the mass media and asked the court to demand from the agency license.
In the "rosbalta" stated that the claims bogus because departments: first, Rollers were not editorial materials, secondly, foul words in them were masked, and thirdly, immediately after the prevention videos were removed from the site.
The agency appealed against claims Roscomnadzor in the world court - and when October 22 2013 Moscow city court accepted the suit roscomnadzor, consideration of these complaints still continued.
However already 25 of the world the judge decided not in favor of "Rosbalt": editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was convicted in violation of the code of administrative offences and fined for 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this and has predetermined outcome hearings in Moscow city court - if reject the idea that outcome could be determined, even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to recognize Invalid registration certificate "Rosbalt", in fact, depriving the agency status of mass media.
One can not say that "Rosbalt" in the course of this conflict remained alone.
The agency supported the state Duma deputies (application to the head of Roscomnadzor Alexander Zharov 10 October signed 26 deputies; the document was filed on the initiative of the CPRF).
About unjustifiable closing publications have stated the head of the union of journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the russian union of journalists Pavel Gusev and head of the president's council on human rights, Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanova, guide Roscomnadzor even give him any guarantee that to withdraw the license it would not go.
The trial of "rosbalta" Revealed: under whose jurisdiction safer to be a means of mass media in Russia today is the big question.

scientists from the university of the Johns Hopkins school of medicine and mount Sinai found protein, thanks to which the "speech FOXP2 gene" carries out its function by stimulating the formation of new relations between the neurons.
A study published in science, on the site of the magazine can be read his summary.
The FOXP2 gene is the first known the genome, the function of which is directly linked to the speech.
Install his role was in 2001 thanks to detect the family of the several people who could not correctly to Pronounce words and sometimes even don't understand each other.
Researchers found that the members of the family was disrupted FOXP2 gene, however, how he performs its function, it was not known.
In the new study biologists have shown that at lEast part of their functions FOXP2 performs as a stimulant formation of new synapses in area of the brain associated with the formation of a speech.
Does this he thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered in the search for the factors that encourage education synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 of these genes found authors, while only on his activity Viet FOXP2.
What SRPX2 really affect vocalization, scientists have confirmed in experiment on MISATO.
When in animals of the activity of the gene was artificially reduced they less shouted at division of with the mother.
If the activity of the gene was fixed, restored and published by the frequency of sounds.
Earlier on mice was also shows a connection with lokalizacja the FOXP2.
Animals, which were injected into the human copy of the gene, pishchals actively and at a lower frequency than normal mouse.
So far, but scientists do not know, do the work of the FOXP2 and, accordingly, controlled them SRPX2 with purely Mechanical properties of education sounds or more Thin processes.

You want the luminous in the dark ice cream?
A British businessman has created the world's first glowing in the dark ice cream with the help of the jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of the animal to develop a glow of food.
He came to this idea of reading scientific article about jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China chemically recreate glowing protein.
Ice cream enters the reaction with the language of who he Eats, raising the pH level in the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris said that since the ice cream glows when responding to heat the mouth, it means that the more you Ligeti, the more it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the company for the production of ice cream "Lesni me, I Tasty", says: "this is an incredible thing, but still at the initial stage, when talking about the production, however for £200 you get about 2 g substance ”.
A protein that we use in ice cream, shall enter into the reaction with your preferred language in a neutral pH.
However, when your mouth with a protein, this will increase the pH level and ice cream begins to glow.
We tested it in the last few months, and it seemed that the ideal is to present it in a Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream from those that I did, because the luminescence of Medusa in four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball cost me about £140.
But it's quite pleasant to taste.
Experimental company Charlie, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of mosaic gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really want to develop the Invisible ice cream"
this is by definition is impossible because of refraction caused by ice crystals, of which consists of ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized Chinese scholars

Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria destroyed all the declared capacities for production of chemical weapons, recognized the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons.
This first stage of disarmament, Damascus has completed the day before the deadline.
Before November 1, Syria was to destroy the production and other auxiliary objects, intended for the preparation of Toxic agents to application, reports BBC.
The destruction of the Stocks of Toxic agents or their chemical components should be completed by the end of 2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, currently Toxic substances are in Sealed repositories.
International inspectors went to Syria after on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, in the course of the chemical attack died, according to the United States, more than 1,400 people.
The main task of the inspectors was not to lose time, not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce any more - chemical weapons and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals equipment and ammunition.
For these production facilities will now carefully observed to prevent their fixing.
The next milestone is the middle of November: by this time the OPCW and the Syrians have to agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of the already existing Stocks of Toxic agents.
Questions here a lot.
Where they will be destroyed?
Who will provide for this equipment?
All the Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence.
They readily'll inspectors new objects for checking, if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus until the end of Honest.
The United States believes that this attack was held regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this was the work of the Syrian insurgents.
The international community is required from the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached by mediated by Russia, is to destroy or lead in the free state of all the facilities for production of shells, Toxic gases and liquids and to fill the shells of these substances.
Now, when this stage passed, the next step is to the destruction of the already existing in the Syrian army chemical weapons.
It is assumed that in this Arsenal may be more than 1000 tons of neuro-paralytic Toxic substances, skin blister agents mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozens of different places.
For its destruction is necessary to the OPCW and the Syrian authorities for the agreed schedule of action - it is two weeks.
The head of the field operations of the OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally watched the destruction of equipment".
"They have no opportunity to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.
The statement of the OPCW says that the inspectors visited 21 from 23 objects in Syria and realise that plants for the production of shells and poisonous substances or destroyed, or are in unsuitability.
The remaining two objects too dangerous to spend an inspection, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and verified by the specialists of the OPCW.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "especially not easy," because I had to work in conditions of the continuing conflict.
In the beginning of October the OPCW has received the Nobel peace prize, however, according to Smith, time to celebrate this inspectors have not yet found - they were too busy work.

George Caravan: the gap with Europe gives not choice
another day, another horror story of independence.
This time we warn that independent Scotland to join European zone of free movement, as a condition of membership of the EU.
It's turn stories about the passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire Adrianova along the wall.
True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits from the more free navigation through the rest of Europe, though -- that predictably is not appeared in headlines.
No one is also pointed out that the EU member states to spend a lot of time to turn their formal rules as they it is convenient.
Since Scotland is not included in the Schengen area, continued non-compliance with the requirements will be cheap concession to Brussels in return for what he really wanted to from the scottish people.
So it's not's worth considering story.
And this old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard "duck ” that" independence means passport control ”, at lEast 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting point, the lost when paraphrase of ancient fairy tales.
Why have an independent Scotland must execute orders of Europe?
Why change the yoke of London on the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great war plan unite Europe has stalled.
With euroclinicum project " Europe " officially dead.
Throughout the European union party opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single exchange, is accelerating.
Even in Germany party euro-skeptics “alternative for Germany " is founded only in this year -- appeared out of Nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September the federal elections, thus essentially expelling“ free Democrats ” (an equivalent of our “Liberal Democrats") of the Bundestag.
There was always internal opposition to plan the federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a Turning point.
Austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European central bank, and the Chains imposed on the national economy through the preservation of a single currency, have led many people to the idea that the project " Europe " has gone too far.
The euro crisis little is connected with the fact that national governments operate at excessive deficits budget - this was true only for Greece.
In fact the Eurosystem blocked their members on exchange rates, beneficial for german exporters, is that the german politicians and want to save.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency South Europe is in advance at a disadvantage in production capacities in comparison with Germany.
The only saving remedy is to cut wages and public expenditures that actively supported by the Berlin.
For the current problems of the budget and exchange is deeper problem productive capacities of Europe.
As a result of the complex of measures on the “green ” energy embedded Brussels, - cipher for subsidizing of french and german energy companies at the expense of the consumer, is a European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
This Paralithodes Adverse price terms, as we have seen in greengate.
No freezing of wages in the world does not stop overwhelming victory cheap U.S. Shale over the European Petrochemical industry.
As a result of the brewing rebellion, especially in France, once the an avid storonnie EU.
After the war, the french political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put the Paris on a level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs in Paris as in the see of political legitimacy, and has already made its own economic policy of the Europe, leaving the destroyed economy of France in distress.
The result is the right to be against the EU party Marin le pen, the national front ” just won a decisive additional elections, throwing the ruling party Socialists in the third place.
"front" now is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - early warning British incoming about what should not proceed from the assumption that the split among the right-wing automatically impact in favor of the left.
What makes le pen with his newfound popularity among french white working class?
She wants to use the elections in the EU in the next year to create block in the European parliament against the EU and against the common currency.
If -- and it is very likely -- opposed to the EU party will receive support in the elections, the block will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European parliament.
Here's my opinion: soon growing mood against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not go away, but he again become something like a loose “Europe (sovereign) of nations", who liked to general de Gaulle.
Germany and several dependent from her economies can save the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore its own currency.
I assume that the United kingdom distances himself from this project, hoping to close to the United States.
Nevertheless, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific ocean indicates the likelihood that the United kingdom will be left without attention in the cold Atlantic.
In what position it leaves Scotland?
We can choose to become the region (in fact) small England.
Or we can protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland would Succeed in the framework of a more free European agreement provided that we will keep its currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in neviditelny Europe nations.
Otherwise we should consider the experience of Norway and preserve our economic independence.
The government of the scottish national party in Scotland is -- strangely - the most successful political movement in Europe aimed against austerity measures, received an impressive majority votes in 2011, thanks to the objections against Cuts costs, the offered (and implemented) labour Chancellor of the treasury of Aleister darlinga and subsequently caused by a coalition of tori and liberal Democrat.
Scotland would now ridiculous to vote for independence, only to take measures austerity imposed on Berlin and Brussels.

Early sexual maturation: aging before
African-American and latin American girl, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation close
there is no evidence that the guilty hormones or other chemical substances
experts believe that the obesity Epidemic may be one of the starting mechanisms of early puberty
the tendency to early puberty not so expressed boys
the former correspondent CNN Pat Etheridge - Journalist specializing in children's health and issues of family.
Should there be Frightened by the mother, if the her daughter is beginning to form the Beginnings of brEast and grow pubic hair in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, children ’ s endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are distributed among American girls and represent the new norm.
"I spend a lot of time, calming parents -- usually it doesn't mean the rapid advance of full puberty, ” said Kaplowitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as increasing the chest, pubic and of the axillary hair and body odor, appear before the girls.
But it was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menses) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased compared with 12,75 in 1970.
"After the chest is beginning to develop, passes at lEast two or three years before menarche ", - said Kaplowitz, is also the author of early sexual maturation girls: how to Cope with this common problem"
time is the most accurate checking how sexual maturation will Prosper.
There is a discussion about what constitutes an onset of puberty, but is considered to be "premature" when brEast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will be or is that a pediatrician may monitor carefully.
The more rapid the progression of can serve as the basis for analyses the endocrinologist, to prevent serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay the early menstruation and prevent another Consequence: premature aging bones, which can ultimately lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations on drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz careful with drugs, but acknowledges that the suppression of puberty may soften behavioral problems and feelings of girls, that they are different from the other girls. "
another big problem is clear: parents simply do not want to have them very young daughters were menstrual period.
"They worry about the risks of pregnancy or even about how they Cope with questions of hygiene, ” said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman, her daughter menstruation which began in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally is ready.
She came home from school same phobic and pissed what she first among their girlfriends.
There are many advertised theories about the reasons of early puberty.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that guilty hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual the statements of the mass media.
The boys -- as girls -- sexual maturation comes before.
Kaplowitz argues that assumption, which has the largest weight is obesity Epidemic.
In 2001 he helped to carry out a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with the terms puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country African-American and latin American girl, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
All over the world on early sexual maturation, apparently affects all: from the economic conditions and climate change to genes.
Another mystery: although boys hair on the face and pubic appear at a young age, a tendency to complete early sex it not so expressed as girls.
Other doctors, participating in the conference AAP, confirmed the complexity of this theme.
The emergence of acne and pubic hair meets even in infants and children of the nursery age.
“we must be careful about how we define the onset of puberty" said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, children ’ s endocrinologist in children ’ s hospital gorieb in the Morristown, new jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to speak with your child.
"This may mean an earlier than expected, conversation," explained Kaplowitz.
If you can keep calm, your child, as a rule, will react well.
Girls, who blossom early, you need to confirm that even when this happens than before, this process is a normal part of life.

These two trader will be the first by the RBS, disconnected during the unfolding of the investigation, which Echoes with scandal connected with manipulation with Interbank rate Libor.
Refusing to comment on the removal, the bank has confirmed that in this month, he received requests for information on the part of regulatory bodies.
"Our current investigation of this question is ongoing and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other regulators," reported in the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, knowledgeable person said that the RBS record to email and instant messaging, which received and sent his former trader, regulates authority of the United kingdom is the management for control over financial activity (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, retired from the RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, it provided a vacation to his current position, head of the European trading in the spot foreign exchange JPMorgan.

Now I'm I resemble on scramp.
I'm not called in the past two years, distribute sweets in his apartment and, most likely, will not and this year.
Yet the statistics shows that I white crow in regard to the Halloween.
According to the national retail federation, most americans -- namely 158 million -- will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candies, costumes and decorations.

Women don't necessarily be the representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, for example pizza, Burgers or carrots.
As for the men, I think we're going to see a lot of Zombies thanks to “a human deadmen ”, and I am sure cosmonauts in style of Daft Punk will get in our tape Instagram this year.
According to Google, the costumes, which are most often is a zombie, Batman, the pirates and witches.
Perhaps, there is nothing bad in the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs in the past year, and to my surprise, we were not the only.
Moreover, according to the national retail federation, americans spend this year $330 million on the costumes for pets.
This means a lot of funny dog-hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we do not melochitsa.
Americans spend to them $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen company.
It is about 600 million pounds Hershey, chocolate candy bars, chocolate milk duds, chewing candies Twizzlers and bars Clark bar.
According to the U.S. Department of commerce, this is excellent news for 41 million require sweets children who prepared conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will purchase and - will not deceive ourselves, that we may eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing that we do not want to use is sweets in the form of Corn kernels; and yet, according to the national association of confectioners, almost 35 million pounds of them sold under the Halloween.
This is about 9 billion individual Corn seeds.
It's a mystery that I still have to solve.
Nothing is so is the Essence of Halloween, at home with ghosts.
They have tremendous names, for example "horror behind walls " (which, incidentally, is located in this prison),“ howl and scream " and " house of shock. "
moreover, according to the society of America haunts in America is 1200 officially recognized houses with ghosts, Generating about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost suddenly that your friend's posted on Facebook, and you can not remove, and then the guy that you like, sees this picture and leave a comment like "Cool the expression".
And in conclusion, let's talk about the pumpkins.
Charlie brown introduced US with great pumpkin when we were children, and cutting of the lamp jack is like Christmas tree decoration, what we do with childhood.
Fortunately for US, the fashion on the child in all started only in the last year due to Pinterest, so most of US grew up by these pumpkin, instead of sitting in them.

Bet becoming increasingly widespread public recognition as a means to get short-term, secured financing.
And when this pawnshops enjoyed not only the categories of people who are in difficult financial situation.

In his opinion, the spread of this information helps to maintain the myth about the so-called russian mafia, ostensibly acts abroad.
As mentioned earlier, "no", yesterday the U.S. Treasury published on its website a list of suspected members of criminal groups "fraternal circle".
Among them was named and russian singer Grigory Leps.
It appears in the list as "Grisha", posted on the eve of the.

the black box you have in a car?
While the American designers roads are trying to find money for repair Scattered system of highways, many will start to see the solution in a little black box, carefully the annex on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, tracking every PROUTEAU motorist mile and Convey this information officials, are located in the heart of the controversial attempts to modernization of the obsolete system of financing of highways of America, made with bodies of Washington and the state.
Usually a boring arena planning highways suddenly spawned intense debates and picturesque alliances.
Libertarian joined the environmental groups in lobbying of the government the right to use the small drawers to track the number of priezjaesh you miles, and perhaps even of where you them pass - and then use this information in the tax accounts.
The movement of the drinking tea in shock.
The American civil Liberties union also deeply concerned about the and raises a number of questions regarding the private life.
And although the congress until may not agree, continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They do ponder as over the next decade, you can go to the system in which drivers are paying for each mile road, which they are travelling.
Thousands of motorists have already taken on testing these black boxes, part of which have the function of satellite tracking.
Is it really necessary for our country.
"This is not a question on which we can have the right of choice, ” said Hassan Arata, executive director of the association of the governments of Southern California, which is preparing plans for the beginning of the track the state authorities miles, priezjaesh each Californian motorist, by 2025.
Will change in the way we pay the taxes.
The technology for this already have.
The necessity for this problem is the lack of funds at the government fund the construction of highways, financed through taxes that americans pay at the petrol stations.
The americans don't buy as many gasoline, as before.
Cars drive more miles per gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, not Rises for 20 years.
The policy does not want to raise taxes even for one penny at high prices for petrol.
"The tax on gasoline simply impossible to save, ” said li manic, an expert on transport policy at the university of Minnesota.
In his state of was recently installed on cars 500 tracking devices for testing the system mobilnoy payment.
"This will be the best alternative in the long term, ” he said.
Nerds call this mobilnoy user fee.
It is no wonder, that this idea attracts urban liberals, because with taxes can be changed character of the trips to reduce the load of roads and emissions of Greenhouse gases, for example.
The authorities in California look narrowly to this system in the course of the development of Strategies to achieve the targets set ambitious the laws of that state to fight global warming.
However, member of the house of representatives of the Bill Shuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the transport committee of the chamber, said he also considers this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Adherents of the free market in the “reason ” also love the fact that will make the drivers to pay for each mile.
"It's not just tax, which will go into the black hole, ” said Adrian Moore, Vice president of political affairs reason.
People directly pay for what they are.
This movement is also supported by two former transport ministers of the United States, which in 2011, called on congress to move in the direction of mobilnoy payment.
The U.S. Senate approved in the last year, a pilot project value of 90 million dollars, in which it was attended by about 10 000 cars.
However, the leaders of the house of representatives rejected the proposal is due to fears of rural state legislators, from Voters that in Everyday life, often to travel a lot of miles to get to work or in the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on the way to independently.
The Biggest enthusiasm is manifested in Oregon, where for participation in the largest experiment in the country attracts 5000 drivers.
These drivers will soon be pay state for miles driven instead of tax on gasoline.
In Nevada pilot project has been completed.
In New York he considered.
Illinois test it on a limited basis with the participation of the trucks.
And the coalition I-95, which includes transport departments 17 states East coast (including Maryland Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studies, as they will be able to carry out these changes.
This concept was not universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, the drivers were concerned that the government can keep track of each of them step.
"concerns about the" big brother "and similar things is a big problem, ” said Aladdin Khan, head of the issues of strategy and management efficiency in the department of transportation of the state of Nevada.
It was not what we wanted people.
When the tests were underway, the American civil Liberties union in Nevada had warned on its website: “very easy will transform these devices in a full-scale tracking devices ”.
There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure, which will inevitably grow to store records about Everyday movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the several states, where we are difficult search for cheap technology, which would allow the authorities of the state to the calculation of priezjaesh car miles, but without the information about the time and place.
If you can do it" said Khan, society will feel more relaxed.
The search for this technology led some agency state to a young company in California called true mileage.
Initially, this company has been promoted in collecting taxes state.
She wanted to go out on the emerging market of the type of insurance, in which drivers are paid based on the run.
But the device, which she tests, attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloadable using a modem.
"People will be more likely to do this, if you're not their speed and not spent their location," Ryan said Morrison, executive director of the true mileage.
There were several big mistakes in some of these pilot programs of the state.
There is much less expensive and less Obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon designers experiment with the provision of the drivers of the various options.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they may not refuse from the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles, which drive all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places are hoping to sell an idea cautious public, forcing the device to do more, not less.
In New York city transport officials seek to develop nalogooblozhenie device, which will also accept payment for interest garage space, to provide “pay as ride it ” insurance and collect pool of data about the speed in real-time from other drivers, which motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“motorists will involve the benefits they offer ", - said the document of urban design.
Some designers transport systems, however, think about is not whether all the talk about mobilnoy paying just a huge a distraction.
In the urban transport commission in the Bay of San Francisco officials say that congress could very easily overcome bankruptcy of trust fund the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline.
Additional a one-off or annual tax would charge drivers hybrid cars and other persons, whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to they paid their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery intervention, when all you need to do is take aspirin ", - said Randy rentshler, director of the commission on law and public relations.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private life and many other things.

Pope Francis, first the Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will raise in San new the Cardinals of the Catholic church for the first time in the period of his service on February 22, as announced on Thursday, the Vatican.
Cardinals are higher in the religious Catholic church after the Pope, and it is they elect the Popes, so Francis will appoint the first group of people, who eventually will participate in the selection of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinal.
However, after the cardinal 80th age he can no longer take part in the elections of the Pope is a prerogative of groups of 120 “Cardinals electors ”.
When this news, a spokesman for the Vatican father Federico lombardi said that before the ceremony in San will be held a meeting of all the current Cardinals, known as consistory.
"Daddy Francis decided to advance to announce its decision to convene consistory in February, in order to facilitate planning other meetings with participation of the Cardinals from different parts of the world, ” said lombardi.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices ” said that by February number Cardinals electors, probably, will decrease.
He said that usually Pope calls as many Cardinals as necessary to again to bring the number of Cardinals electors up to 120, as well as many Cardinals over the age of 80 years as he wants.
Consistory next year will be of great importance, because it will be the first since the election of Francis in march this year, according to the Valero.
At the moment there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether will appoint a new Pope Cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance, ” he said.
In South America live forty percent of Catholics, but they are insignificant number of Cardinals.
This will also be the first selected Cardinals since the formation of Francis; the council of the Cardinals - group of eight Cardinals from all over the world, which is to look for ways to the reform of the church.
In the past, the Pope all decided on their own.
"Now, Francis picked eight Cardinals, so they helped ", - said the Valero.
He said that "it is quite possible ” that Francis will turn to Cardinals for advice.
But we were not in such a situation before -- all of this for US for the first time.
Valero said the Pope usually built in the position of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis "is full of surprises, however we don't know who he would name ".

At the present time, they do not and subsidies are direct service obligations in the region.
In view of this, the government of the priority considers direct support of industrial enterprises, not financing through them oil industry.
Assistance budget will be connected with the investment projects, which will be implemented in the production.
Many heads of companies expressed concern in connection with the evolving situation in relations with the oilmen.
Subsidy on purchased them equipment is a competitive advantage of the industry of the South of the Tyumen region, and the abolition of the difficult to compete on price with the central strip of Russia, where more than cheap work force.
In addition, unclear issue with continuity new owner, TNK-BP company Rosneft, which does not place their orders for the Tyumen enterprises.
Agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and applications for its extension is not received.
Currently, the enterprise of the South region that specialize on the equipment for the oil and gas sector, can not form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
Remains an open question whether taxes will be available from the mined in the Uvat district of oil in the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner fields.

According to their estimates, beer consumption in the country in the year ahead will stay on the same level, and this is in the best case.
Although businessmen initially expected growth.
Because the current year is for them fail: sales fell by 7 percent.
About all this, told the head of one of the largest brewing companies of the country, the chairman of the council of the union of russian Pivovarov Isaac Schoeps on III annual meeting of the Adam Smith institute "goods FMCG in Russia," which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012 the russian beer market has decreased by 18 percent, because in recent years in the country there is considerable increase of regulation of the brewing industry in part of the production and sales of beer - drink with a slight alcohol content" said listeners Schoeps.
In any country of the world there is no such hard restrictions beer market, unpredictable introduction of all new and new illogical prohibitions which justified ostensibly struggle with the abuse of alcohol.
Unique complained that many legal prohibitions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse, do not have much influence, nevertheless constantly appear all new initiatives.
Most of all for producers of beer hit introduced with this year the ban to sell alcohol in kiosks.
"We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers" said Isaac Schoeps.
For the next year the Pivovarov two forecast.
The optimistic is the one who spoke Schoeps: sale foam drink will remain unchanged.
Pessimistic fall - even on 2-3 percent.
To save your profits, businessmen are forced to go away from the varieties of intended for mass consumption in the class of "premium": beer will become less, but it will cost more expensive.

What will the construction of TPU in Moscow
every year the capital authorities promise to arrange more the transport interchange nodes (TPU).
Up to 2020. It is planned to enter into operation 255 TPU.
What actually becomes the project was our correspondent.
A couple of months ago near metro station "Smolensk" Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line was building a fence.
It stated that goes arrangement transport interchange node.
It was all very strange, because the next to "Smolensk" no land transport does not stop and, consequently, then it is not.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stops on the garden ring, one must overcome about 130 meters, including land transition through karmanitski lane.
Now the "Smolensk" almost all finished.
Disappeared flower stall, demounted stand for newspapers and asphalt before entering a paving stones.
That's the whole transport junction.
Transport-interchange nodes are plane and capital, "explains the press service of the municipal department of transport.
Capital TPU while are not present.
And Planar include the construction of the parking, conclusion of commercial objects, hindering the passengers movement, the creation of small architectural forms and refurbishment.
Actually, plane TPU even do not transporters, and professional blagoustroena from department of overhaul of the city of Moscow.
Transport junction is not necessarily a complex construction, " says the director of the institute of economy of transport and transport policies of the higher school of economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes it's a roof over your head and board, alerting about the time of arrival of transport.
So, for example, the metro station "establishment" recently opened a full-fledged Planar locations node.
Let without shelter, but with perehvatyvaet car parks and board, mark, when he Cometh bus.
But in pursuit of a number of officials recorded at TPU all that neither drowning man.
Still in 2011, the municipality of planned to build all about everything 151 node, of them 59 with capital construction.
Now the plans before 2020 are up to 255 TPU.
150 of them promise to give back in this year.
Although in the city there is the development of TPU, not indicated no quality criteria, "states Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization" the city and transport ".
Report on the number of objects, but the quality of transfers on each of them often worse.
Criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first - the time savings in transplantation, secondly - convenience.
First of all, the ability to change the type of transport, not leaving the rain.
In Moscow the same under the arrangement of TPU often goes exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the metro station "VDNH".
Before suburban buses with Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance in All-Russian exhibition center.
Now they have a stop on the Opposite side of the street yaroslavki cosmonauts.
Further from the metro, much further from monorail, but closer to the residential houses.
The gift that people do not want to bus station under the windows, and complained in all possible Instance.
With capital TPU in Moscow somehow not immediately unlucky.
The first of them started to build five years ago near metro station "Planernaya"
the project aims to was to become a model.
And really is the model of the locations node, extremely left to investors, turns into a banal shopping centre.
No, there are platforms for buses, shed, not to go from the metro in the rain, and three floors of the parking spaces.
True, Khimki Trolleybuses produced in Belarus # 202 and # 203 in Moscow at the place was not fundamentally.
It's been pushed away from the metro.
But the place under the trade more left.
One only clothes 32 shop, and in general there are almost all - from pet supplies to show.
Well, in fact, suddenly whom of the passengers of the bus will need buy in the way a new car?
We have, as they build capital TPU, will always get the shopping centre.
Recently the situation reached its logical finish when part of the parking decided to give at the market.
Now on the third floor of TPU "Planernaya" among marked on the floor parking places is street trade.
Vegetables, Spices, Chinese jeans, nerusskaya speech and the guards, grinned poglyadyvaya on our photographer.
Locations node finally turned into Bazaar.
The fact is that before the metro station "Planernaya" was the market, but his demolished.
And in the prefecture traders regretted and putting on intercepting parking interchange node.
Still due to high prices are always there is empty.
Now the funny that the market was demolished in order to build on its place... New Planar TPU.
This is castling.
The metro station "Kaluga" distance approach from the metro and bus was 50 meters, " says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a shopping center, ostensibly, at a distance of increased up to 170 meters.
To sit in the bus, it is necessary to pass through the shopping center.
After 22: 00 hours when it is closed, have to bypass him under the open sky.
However, construction on the "Planernaya" and "Kaluga" soon seem flowers.
In the middle of September urban land commission approved the mayor's office on planning solutions for the first eight capital TPU.
Four of them will 25-storied, not counting the two or three underground lines.
The monster will grow from metro station "Tushino", it will 418,7 thousand sq.m.eters square.
Representatives of the Directorate of the railway stations of russian railways, responsible for the construction of TPU metro have already told journalists: in the future high-rise buildings will contain shops, hotels and apartments.
The officials say that storied parking Zaj ­ Mut from third to half of the square.
Take for example "folk" garages.
For example, a garage for 258 garages, who recently built on the international street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for the parking in 2.6 thousands of cars in the "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" need about 80 thousand "squares"
this is less than one third of the Colossus that there were going to build.
Let one or two floors will go to any platforms for buses.
Remains at lEast 150 thousand square metres of commercial real estate.
And this is, in a minute, almost two gum.
If the capital at the stations and stations are building a railroad, the other platforms will develop metropolitenovets.
They also promised that there will be a lot of "objects functional purpose", including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
By the way, in the department of property of the city of Moscow, recently told reporters that develop the draft resolution, according to which the investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Because they say that transport issues for the city is a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the "Harvard" in Boston or "Spadina" in Toronto" said Alexander Morozov.
There trolleybuses and trams go down in the ground at the level of the metro and distance approach from the car to the tram station is only 50 meters without out on the street.
Around no extra trade.
But Moscow officials throws into extremes.
Or nothing will build, or too Agrochem 25 floors with offices and apartments.

Profit Bombardier decreases with the fall of the supply and the number of orders placed on aircraft
the corporation Bombardier, the Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, reported on Thursday on the reduction of net profit by 15 percent under the influence of the decreased number of orders and deliveries aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
Located in Montreal, Bombardier also not published no data on the flight testing of its latest CSeries aircraft and has not provided new information about whether are ambitious plans to introduce the plane in commercial operation to the next September.
After the first flight prototype aircraft held about one and a half months ago, he flew still only three times that raises questions about whether stage of tests on schedule.
The results were acquitted forecasts and led to decrease of more than 8 per cent on the stock exchange of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with the national bank financial, reduced on Thursday your evaluation with " above the average ” to “the average ” due to the belief that the growth of shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
"Although the decline of deliveries of the aircraft was in a predictable, we will certainly disappointed indicators of profit transport department, ” said Doerksen in the review of the stock market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries program as the flight tests.
Nevertheless, if in the coming months will not be announced the new orders, we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
The company Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft will enable it to gain the place in the lower price segment of the market, where now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype aircraft was introduced in march, and for the first time has made the flight in September after a few months delay.
However, solid orders for the CSeries does not too many - 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to verify the approval of the company on the fuel efficiency and the potential efficiency of new liner.
Only now has 403 order and agreement with 15 customers and operators.
Chief executive director Pierre Baudoin was sure that Bombardier will reach their goals in 300 solid orders to the point when the first aircraft will be launched in the commercial operation.
On Thursday heads also assured the analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan.
“test model airplane had not stayed on earth for longer than expected, ” said Baudoin during the conference call, adding that the downtime aircraft were planned ground tests and the software Update.
All manufacturers plan to test in different ways.
We decided to hold the first flight and make a break for updates, so we did.
So will occur within the whole program flight tests.
The second of the five test samples should make a flight in the coming weeks and all other soon follow him, according to the company.
Yet analysts are skeptical about the statement about the fact that the first client can begin to the exploitation of the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
The company Bombardier announced that it evaluates the commissioning and give a new information in the next few months.
“the slow Pace of flight tests - though apparently and meets the internal graphics Bombardier - supports our point of view that commissioning will be transferred to the first quarter of the year 2015 ", - said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, terminated 30 September, net income Bombardier decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.
The gross income decreased slightly - with $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected profit 10 cents per share and gross profit of $4.56 billion, according to the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's largest producer of aircraft reported that he had 45 aircraft for the quarter, which is less than in the previous year -- 57.
The total number of orders fell with 83 to 26 aircraft.
Portfolio of orders Aerospace research department was $32.9 billion on 30 September, re from 31 December.
“in Aerospace region results correspond with our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions became unpleasant factor ", - said Baudoin.
Gross profit on Aerospace direction fell by 13 percent - up to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest manufacturer of trains, reported that the gross income in this sector has grown almost 11 percent, to $2.1 billion.
Portfolio of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion on 30 September, which is a little higher than from 31 December.
On the income of transport units have had problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The government has declared that it in the fourth quarter will be presented a new plan development.
The company's shares Bombardier, which also announced that the chief financial officer of Google Patrick pichett enters the board of directors, fell to 8.5% - up to $4,83 to bid in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer sa, the third in the world largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor Bombardier, reported on Thursday to reduce quarterly revenue on 10 percent.
