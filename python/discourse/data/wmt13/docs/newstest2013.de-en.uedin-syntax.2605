A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat the electoral fraud.
However, the latter holds the Brennan Center for a myth, as it confirmed that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republican lawyers have recorded in 10 years in the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: The new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these actions undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the Member States.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 has announced new laws which hinder the process for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition to these laws also shortened the time frames for the early vote annulled the right to register as voters on election day and citizens to file a court denied the right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state of the electorate wants to purchase an identity card.
Indiana was the first state that has made such a request.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years encouraged them in 34 states draft laws that allow voters to provide photo identification showing.
It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identification card as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, in other words, 21 million voters who lack photo identification issued by a government authority of their state.
Beyond Neuwähler five million in 2012 do not have such a permit.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay to receive the required identification.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification.
This goes further.
The students that are seen as voters cast their votes for Democratic candidates increasingly are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification issued by its creation.
On the other hand, the same states it would unite members of hunting or fishing, the stronger for the Republican side chose to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state has asked for proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduced such a demand.
For 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes.
Because it is clear that two of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states have also sponsored legislation that was abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups limited to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign for voter registration in general elections in 2004 helped to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the percentage of registration of Neuwählern 2010 has been reduced by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican lawmakers in five other states have also passed laws designed to shorten the period of the early vote.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who voted in advance, African-Americans, even though they account for only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who constituted 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate voted in advance.
Of course, have opposed the Democratic legislators and their supporters with the adoption of laws, which restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require showing a photo ID.
But the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the influence of the results in the 2012 crucial states passed laws and see them as a clear objective.
A report by the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that those states that have passed these laws, account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: The new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these actions undermine the democratic system of the United States.

Prostate cancer screening: The test should be done or not?
The PSA test do indeed sometimes faulty results, with false negatives and false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to a greater reluctance of undecided men already for the holding of early detection tests.
The test should be done or not?
We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States passed a series of disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without screening.
This study has also shown that is the likelihood of forming metastases by 30 to 40% higher under observation after 12 years if no screening has been carried out.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 40 or 50 years, if you have a direct relative, who had already been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
In men Afro-American is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, once a cancer was detected.
There are aggressive and other cancers, the Indo seaside.
The patient has to really understand the extent of the risk of cancer will be made by him pointed out the possible options, in which prostate cancers can remain untouched, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in this case you would rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today is taking place in many men, in which it has detected cancer, no treatment, as her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active surveillance in them and offers a treatment for them in progression of the disease.
It determines the criteria for deciding who should and cannot be treated with increasing accuracy.
Therefore, I recommend the implementation of the test.
But the most important thing is to talk with your doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society of Urology Movember has developed a tool with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.
This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available soon) can be downloaded at the following address: Http: / / ca.movember.com / FR / man-health / pros Tate-cancer screening
Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and get enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise at least 50%," said Andre Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely harms people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: The abandonment of the cigarette after 10 years, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, bowel wrath, mast Speiseröhren-, pancreas, colon cancer and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against colon cancer wrath," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm- or rectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, salting and drying can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"the latter can damage the cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have examined the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While a study has found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another likely showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also been shown yet.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed how important it is to talk to his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."

The Higgs analyzed only 1
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bosons last summer has a certain amount of consternation, and with good reason.
We believe, in fact, that only 1 is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And, after all, is the last particle predicted that the existence of the standard model of our best or "least bad" declaration of nature and the behavior of matter, but was not yet observed empirically.
But it is not yet fully safe for the physicists that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs tetraquarks strongly resembles.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data that were presented in this week of a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are still missing data to be completely sure about that.
We are still working on the assumption that it really is the Higgs, as apparently only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we look at what it is about.
This means that two objects cannot be present at the same place at the same time, there is an inevitable past law in this world.
It is not possible to break this rule, and don't try too hard, because you are hurt themselves.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world turns out that such a law applies to them too: The Pauli's exclusion principle that says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they find themselves in the same "quantum state" and the "state" largely consists of some of their properties.
On this basis share the particle physicists into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens be described as a Fermione, and obey the Pauli principle.
And in another move the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - at least not this principle, which means that they can, in fact, are in the same place at the same time.
These bosons members, according to the Web site, The particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: The mesons, which we will not treat here and the "force" that spread the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs particle tetraquarks related in some way.
It must be stressed, however, that these particles are not all so exotic creatures, as one might think.
If you are able to read this story, it is only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The photon or the "light particle," which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If, in fact, a particle accelerated with an electrical charge or change the way the electromagnetic field will come to this place was "upset" about like a pebble thrown in a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "winner of force."
More stable field
The same is true for the Higgs only 1, with the difference that must be "disturbed" another field, the Higgs field, so that shows that only 1.
But the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen needs to reach very high energy, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could be only a very large rock mox.
Therefore, the Large Hadron Collider, a giant particle accelerator as the CERN required is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.
The analogy of the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd again.
There are, in fact, not all materials and not all particles that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others not, for example, a sheet of paper would never think of themselves in the refrigerator.
And not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
For what all this research can now be "good," asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they serve the revision of the standard model (SM), and they allow physicists to closely examine all deviations from the observations and predictions of SM.
There are also many physicists eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could open the door to a "new physics" and fill some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter has serious shortcomings, as it offers no explanation for dark matter and gravity (ups!), which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (re-ups!).
However, at CERN, such differences were not found until now.
Impact
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs have not believed that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact gave us the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first time line laser (NI) were the first - said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a "laboratory" gimmick.
Imagine...
Applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle again in 1969 during his work has developed a small light sensor in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose this sensor serves today all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
Of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...

Le DAAD | palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on "death with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of the life.
The debate must be resumed in the near future, although a bill being prepared.
However, there remains much to be done in this important area.
The DAAD tried to look at this more.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie yet.
The prostate cancer, which he aufzehrte, had left him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years," he said, half-hearted, lying in his bed at the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, you cannot be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: An immense weakness prevents alone to go to the toilet, and even to eat.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he agrees to be resigned to help with food.
He even managed to smile and to talk with the stranger who employed around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhea because this is humiliating," he shares with.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this malady.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man standing pinkelt," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
For some people, going back to the early stage is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept a retrograde step, he said.
Because in the view of several people who work in palliative care, major events taking place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients admitted in palliative care for the home of Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are inundated with so-called "healing" care by doctors and nurses who care about them, not more.
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear of dying "deliberately and through asphyxiation".
But by the disease, I really know my children.
"I have good kids," adds them.
"I have no wish more in life," she says, before she accepted that it acquires a mask to help her breathe.
She is expected in the next few days still a last visit to her son, who is from Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois it offers assistance in terms of food intake and body care with a group of volunteers.
The relatives will be used if there are no other options.
In order to make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec comes on a bed for the relatives of state aid.
This is very little, given that one day we will all die.
Here, life continued under the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It gives the dying according to an oral care with Pepsi or brandy.
Diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Last night, Mr X serves a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," said Nathalie Savard, nursing director.
At the home of Victor-Gadbois is not a day as the other.
In addition to an old man at the age of 93, the last family gathering in the courtyard is well supported by his pillow, while you do in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, died tragically, after he has tried everything, in order to survive.
"For six months are three to five beds are occupied with cancer patients at less than 45 years of age," agrees Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with.
53% of patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their abode, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, that is, to a care that is supposed to relieve the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of her life, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Association for palliative care home in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
This ensures that several major shortcomings in the Quebec healthcare in palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
For the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the healthcare system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all right to have a high-quality palliative care, before you accept, move on euthanasia.
Recently, she says, have I seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, but that it has taken measures to alleviate it.
I fear that patients are dying simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions hard until the last day.
The chances of survival of Richard Hélène were already minimal when it has canceled an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin that I will cancel the treatment, she told me that they regret that I abandon the fight, told them.
However, they had told me that I was in the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nurses, that it has not granted this wish, after a team of palliative care have been relieved of their pain.
But it must be said clearly that the relatives in pain treatment is not Janet Quarton.
After former Monereau, head of the company's relatives of the domestic relatives of Montreal, 8% of patients are not talking to a pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often returned to the terminal sedation, which amounts to the patient either permanently or sporadically until the time of his death einzuschläfern.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
More and more patients without pain relief will have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain will not be relieved say all the same sentence: "I will die."
But that does not necessarily mean that "I want you to euthanise me," but "I want my alleviate pain."
The realization of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.

Real estate scandals on a large scale in Quebec
Officials of the Office of road construction, Bauhauptgewerbes Geldbeschaffer of political parties and the Italian Mafia experts tell every day, what they know about a great "system" of companies that are involved in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
"Industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayer in the province of Quebec, Canada, in particular in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange, as the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures," a small audio recorder Jacques Duchesneau, an MEP in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him for a thorough investigation of embezzlement in connection with the contracts to road construction in Quebec, the former prime minister had agreed only reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the study in 2010," he said, "the Department of Transport alone would have saved $1 billion to the treaties," because some zügelten their instinct to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors on a case," he adds, in the hope that it will be able to "demonstrate the tactics behind the individuals."
Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit
Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit is making great efforts to identify and government analysts, accountants, with their troops.
Besides the policemen of the "sewer cartel" that "Marteau-force," which has led since 2009 Montreal in the artificial inflation of the Treaties restrained manner...
In recent weeks, they carried out house searches piles and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal assemblies as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having received bribes in exchange for public contracts repeatedly.
Engineers were also specifically accused of road construction office of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, like Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has attracted attention by the Commission of the functioning of the "system," he said to the maintenance of public contracts.
He has received several years in Montreal 3% of the value of contracts linked to the Mafia with a paid agent who gave the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Beitrag Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000's, when he was more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberal landslide in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fundraising for the liberal former Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described it in detail before the Commission: In ten years he received gifts from contractors, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as 736.000 dollars in bribes in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials of the road office have admitted that they could lubricate themselves by making the bills with false services artificially by 30-40% aufblähten.
Martin Dumont, an organizer of the party of the mayor, accused Mr Tremblay that he has deliberately overlooked on a shadow budget, its coffers filled with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, and Montreal crashed into a serious crisis.
Chantal.. was one of the first members of Montreal, suggested the alarm.
As the mayor of the city district, in the eastern part of the island, Rivière-of-Prairies rejected themselves in 2010 against the sale of municipal land that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million in property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% of black money in election campaigns
In the study, carried out in the end, she says that she is "on a thread that makes it possible to understand the workings of the system of ants under his hands to stop the evil and to expose the guilty."
It says that the procedure was "painful but positive".
We are about to clean the wound but need only one for Montreal certain investigative unit, as well as an oversight to prevent a return of questionable practices.
It is clean.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part in that, "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is especially concerned about the role of "office holders who are aware of the tactics," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a share of 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec a small audio recorder he: "I was told that it was just a poor substitute of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to political parties to $100, which, according to him, nothing would change in the situation: "As long as the campaign spending are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the procurement and funding of political parties: "We cannot fall deeper; when we get to the bottom of the things with courage, can we rebuild the house on a more solid footing with more controls and laws."
If this story damages that Montreal and Quebec's international reputation, Mr Duchesneau urges people to laugh about it to take a look in their own backyard.

"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season with PSG have taken on a new dimension.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players are coming.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff has given me too much.
These elements spur me every day to improve my game level.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything is very fast.
But I do not suspend in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Jeff...
This summer's newcomers are accustomed to carry games to very high levels.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
The result is that a player as I must provide the forehead and wants to do his best.
It gives me Carlo Jeff a lot in terms of my game position.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Jeff is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Jeff instills respect all the technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think of the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon have taken the place of the top rider.
But we lurk in the ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: In this way we have qualified for the first knockout round.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as much as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First, we want to be first in our group before Porto, so that we can fight the return leg of the eighth final home game.
The PSG can be a great European club in the short term?
He has already had the budget for that...
To be a great European club has to win the Paris title and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG the resources so that this project is taking shape.
It would be a huge failure, not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case during the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really close to our hearts, that title match.
During the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough for the victory.
We have finished the season with a strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be masters with 79 points.
But those of Montpellier, another team, has made an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux contending for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
If, however, we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and it still is something that one can accuse us, this is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win 4-0 with every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
Look at Manchester City, an association of the last two seasons fails to qualify for the first knockout round, and made the huge expenditure.
In view of the sums invested believed you break the game with 15 points ahead.
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well during the last season, were made by this new PSG "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be the smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, it speaks of a "real-dependence".
That means that this season is powerful and shoots many goals.
He has therefore come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has reminded that he is a great player and a world star.
We respect both the player and the person within the team.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How do you experienced with the French national team's Euro 2012.
As a disappointment.
It was very important to me to participate in the European Championships.
Unfortunately, it has prevented me from my injury, beat out a season.
I have seen things there, from which I am stronger.
Today, I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This was my hope with the "Bleus" since my inauguration.
From what we have learned our lesson and now we need to show exemplary behavior, occurred in Ukraine.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by he had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that the "Bleus" Didier Deschamps will lead to Brazil.
This is forced draw in Spain on October 16 (1: 1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used for everyone else.
Before that meeting in Spain, I have never seen a comparable game in my career.

With Bitcoin is possible without bank payment and selling
The opposite of the current monetary exchange between the parties on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees.
Furthermore, it is a political vision, as so often in these technologies tangible: The belief that the current monetary system designed by bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, the invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) Bitcoin both a virtual currency convertible (but in dollars, euros and so on) and a protocol for the secure exchange like BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin as a gift or as a means of payment.
After the Bitcoin rate had reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later on $2 before he has now recovered to around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world of real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in a report published in October on virtual currencies has shown interest in this.
She describes Bitcoin as "the greatest success with the virtual currency," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a game that you can win by playing or buy back (and sometimes exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
But each time, the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin auditors, trustee of the invoice book at the same time, money-issuers and buyers and sellers are all network nodes.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the account book spread across the entire network of public accounts are available.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task, which will start on the computers, with the winner, who is a sort of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, or the conversion of a large file in a short and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers will "take" the new transaction and add a number to her, "hacked" before the whole thing.
The goal is to find the number that makes a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily examine whether it is the right one.
The transaction is permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay less than 10 minutes to cheat twice (quickly) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other is still no link, as both have different fingerprint.
The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward on a regular basis, probably before the end of 2012.
The circulating Bitcoins are thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some leeway.
It also increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement in the performance.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and robbed the Bitcoin deposits.
"The used vulnerability is not the proper protocol," Pierre Noizat insured, the very Paymium has introduced, this is a company to pay with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported about the possibilities of money laundering by means of this anonymous service.
Cash also rejects these shortcomings, however.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations this.
They are accepted by others, such as the blog WordPress platform.
Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute in Israel have recently analyzed the invoice book and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are in circulation.
A "mega-sales" was launched in November.
"thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," is pleased that Bitcoins Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coin Abul converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a mobile phone with a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment, but uses Bitcoin validation of the transactions that are cheaper.
The owner also manages its identity, and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with retailers, and they do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
They must simply gives an address, which can be identified and photographed by a telephone ", Pierre Noizat assured that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend where hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally oriented systems be reconsidered.
"It will take some time before the Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, by the way, to re-evaluate the various, today as highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency.

We have withdrawn from the country.
And after that?
French troops have left Afghanistan in the Kapisa and Surobi) in their area of responsibility.
NATO and the United States are likely to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back the property of their territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without all of us expected.
We have punished Afghan farmers in particular, as we have seen them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, and the injured and crippled.
The Taliban are from foreign extremists, former leaders fled to Pakistan, but often from farmers who refuse an armed international presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their secular and archaic traditions, even if they have joined jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries to be more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I watched from a hill with almond trees, which was financed with the help of French loans, was carried out properly.
The lorry exceptionally from helicopters and armored convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no receive more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At the time, Kabul was empty and the country because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups covered by the war.
The takeover was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mujahedeen, the Afghan government and the Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The key figures of the anti-Soviet war have come back to power in 2001.
They have turned into this racket in that they have seized land from the government to sell it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive American subcontracting withdrew.
They have discredited themselves, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting.
As I have heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as those who have been able to leverage the American contributions: The flight is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has a population of 5 million, which is one-fifth of the population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of girls as boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the old parties obscurantism nor for the corruption of some executives, you will need to provide jobs.
Everyone, including the armed factions, are obsessed with mobile phones, the television with his Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is seen everywhere.
An army is now available.
Will the authorities, under whose command they stand, regarded as legitimate.
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle to strive for the restoration of the militias in the province, which are beyond the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities was supposed to benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation in the example of Western nations, but through the abolition of the office of the prime minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution, the US would make him a centralised state with a strong presidential alga Walt.
President Karzai does not want foreign inspections, especially during the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country since the 1950s and long before it is dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional storage plants are absent and important irrigation system has not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables will produce nothing.
The private initiative will be given the priority.
In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, a state control of the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
It also reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, in order to seize his.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on the spot, or no mining is possible without means of transport for export across the mountains.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary to re-establish normal relations, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Girls and young Institute for French at universities, high schools, French Institute, support, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "of civilian-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set in 2012, to be carried out by a small French NGO and carried out a number of charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which many local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising, wells, irrigation, drinking water, soil conservation, reforestation, fruit trees and increase agricultural land.
What gift can we return to military spending of two billion euros.
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions that are very hard in these valleys are often situated at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters.
In the message, dozens of written questions of small projects undertaken by communities of Kapisa province.
In order to relieve the farmers of the uprising led by foreign groups, which is their desire for their own statements, the continuation would be less, well-controlled and they needed directly related to civilian aid in their favor.

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains divided on the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily granted the unlimited power, more than ever, he has decided to put everything on a card.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt a final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had offered two additional months for the conclusion of his works to the House.
Egypt is now for almost two years based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only ensured an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents remains the president in his "autocratic delirium," he continues "breaks his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the part of his supporters be assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period, which means the brothers to renounce their project, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy, raging across the country during the protest.
After affirmations in an interview with the American Time newsreel Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Since the Egyptian people resorting to a hasty vote will be an ultimatum: "Either correct my draft for you or I keep the unlimited authority," the latter should take an alleged end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly, the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The Liberal majority is the appeal failed.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned themselves because they believe that they were not able to get their views on the other.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or the society acted alike.
Yesterday morning in a hurry 11 people, deputy members, have been added to the achievement of the quorum.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of the day... is expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the clock was not exactly the constituent assembly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, is, after all, identical to that of the 1971 constitution states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, is an important requirement for the establishment of Islamic law, had hoped that "the principles" be replaced by "the rules," which would have allowed more rigorous application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article was not changed, proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy," say the liberals who see this only as a propaganda blow.
Because, according to them, is the Islamisation other articles of the constitution.
She acknowledges a consultative role in Article 220 in mind, of the University of Al-Azhar, particularly with regard to verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier is disturbing, because "the people who will be asked to give an opinion, have not been elected and no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals are also fed by the fact that the next chancellor of the university will be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text is not an Ulema, but academics, some of which have been trained under the French system, "Alexis Blouet assuaged, a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitution of Transition writes.
He admits, however, that "there may be some ambiguity in relation to Article 220, because the terms are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One relates in particular to the "fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence, work that Red.
And in the future could be raised the question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide. "
Apart from its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday strongly criticised by the far-reaching powers, which he granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another sticking point: The powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will not presented to Parliament, but a national defense council.
There will also be a ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as human rights organisations have demanded.
The latter also share their fears in relation to the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right of free expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women underscores 2006 Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
They believe that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to comment last night on TV, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the Head of State will demonstrate Saturday.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While lawmakers and civil rights groups to discuss what benefit brings the law on compulsory language tests for migrants act criminals already with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families left behind in the home.
On December 1, a law in force, according to which each migrant work must take a test that certifies the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule only applies to immigrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests with the time according to Föderaler migration authority should be compulsory for all guest workers in the future.
It not only language tests, but tests in the Russian history and store the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must be found for both the conservation and the renewal of work permits.
The exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also exempt from this legislation are those who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Problem, meaning and protection of rights
Ask the entirety of the examination will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language and the Russian University of friendship, the St. Petersburg State University, the Moscow State University, and other nations are Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities, already more than 160 such centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, however, questioned several times before the entry into force of the law in the press the following question: What is it all about?
What changes is the requirement to show language skills for both the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, say the migration authority spokesman, go to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Board representation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected even before their departure.
Only organized recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future generation without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which put him under the pretext of aid in a narrow, dark shack, where he will sit with dozens of unmatched months without food and documents and slave 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you promised the One and, upon arrival, you cheated, decreased their passports and will not get the promised salary," the Tajik migration authority confirms the head of the main administration for labour migration, Tolib Schwaripow.
No grumbling, chief.
Yet to many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money that they not only do not speak the language of the country, but also can hardly express written in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much her fault, rather than the evil: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can only provide a sound basic education.
Because there is not even money to feed the children in their families, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school clothes.
As a teenager, these children will take the first opportunity to earn money immediately.
"It is difficult without knowledge of the language," to give them.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists say the following important aspect in terms of the law.
The test must drop only immigrants with legal status.
You do not have that status, so there is no investigation and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile keeps the bulk of guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "access to banned unauthorized individuals"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the language difficulties.
It also costs the legalization of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
You can quickly and simply make a fake registration for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that, for the most part, our documents forged and that we will emerge from this and are not registered cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow told journalists.
"merely spare no expense for false papers"
Earlier on the day the law in force, turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates that certify the completion of language tests have already been hijacked by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners of this not for nothing: Every migrant hoped to be able to save that the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a migrant work three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and civil rights groups agree.
For the moment, the authorities promise only guest workers covered by the test for the first time that you have time for a basic language course.
Newcomers without language skills are also offered places in areas where people with no active communication is necessary.

Interior ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons in crimes very low
The Russian Ministry plans a tightening of the arms bill for private gun owners.
The authorities to respond to the recent events: Injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the punishment of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police will ban the use of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The chairman of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, has supported the proposal and promised that the changes to the weapons law will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attraction of the screws.
An open letter was published on the Internet, its author, representatives of various weapons associations, call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless" aggravations.
The percentage of registered gun crimes is very low, said the road cheeky activist, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior were 142 crimes committed with the use of weapons in the course of six months recorded in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that private gun owners for a tightening of the law will not deter criminals to serve on the black market.
At the moment, you can find every possible weapon for little money, according to the authors, in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Home Office said that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From the factories to the officers
The weapons reach through multiple channels on the black market.
There are five main channels, Viktor Baranez tells a former colonel, was active in the Education Ministry and the General Staff of the ten-year period.
Screenshot takes on a Web page, the weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons, the vigilante will be stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that these are weapons that were stolen from both chambers from the arms of the police force and directly by employees of law enforcement agencies.
Further illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals.
For many military camps often came to explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases was arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Make a contribution to the black market under Baranez arms manufacturers.
"Today there are countless private arms factories that do not meet the international competition and therefore the weapons dump under the hand on the black market, not only in Moscow," the expert said.
The smuggling is another channel of the black market.
In particular, many rifles and pistols come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is one of their own, some small-scale production, as well as a mafia that organized the smuggling," explains the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated how much each of the five channels has roughly to the delivery of the black market in illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was submitted by the Centre for problem analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal State Statistics Service, American literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal arms comes from the army and the legal protection authorities, according to investigators.
Half of all weapons on the black market are going through the "guilt of those found in their work to do with weapons," the report states.
According to the researchers, the data come from 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% from illegal excavations.
A sales manager of a store of weapons, does not want to be named, assured that weapons found at illegal excavations dreams about buying because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to obtain a weapons cache in the supply.
She bought a weapon, for example, a TT-type gun.
The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence.
"The retailer sells them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines and puts the weapon in the city," he told
"The police know, of course, know about everything and, therefore, if they cannot meet the plan to the discovery of crime, periodically check purchases by traders who offer illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"As the luxury shop."
Buyers and sellers are most often about friends to each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs, when someone became aware of me and I proposed to reach the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me that would go to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
The price of the weapon I was only there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the technician. "I have a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go out and find themselves with a code as "Ivan melt of potassium, lithium, and scandium chloride, the target that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am now even in some key rings on a friend that I trust.
He gives me the key rings also is only because he knows that I don't verpfeife.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he wrote an article on the subject.
The schemes have not changed according to him.
He got a photo album, in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like in luxury goods," recalls of military personnel.
The buyer gets loud Baranez rather than a pig in a poke can try everything.
I buy a potential customer rather than simply drive the seller in the forest, and there is a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
Buy from the sofa
Internet search engine show search results pages and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons "offered for different purposes."
It will not need any papers there are still personal meetings.
"You need just the right amount of money," says in the advertisement on the website "battle to buy a rifle or pistol."
There are questions and give users on your orders.
It will also be sold to minors.
"Of course without a license," asks users "Ivan The direct quote).
"buy a TT. Moscow" is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow."
The Federal Security Service shut recently countless bogus websites and buyers who want to buy weapons, the service are crowding into the net.
The people are as hungry feeding fish and land in Siberia and allowed coal scoop
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard about the following way: The site is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws are not applicable.
The leaders take the orders.
The buyer transfers the money at a bank machine.
"When it gets a photo and a description of the gun," said the press spokesman of the nonprofit organization "Pravo na Verstecks oryzhie" Dmitri Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stressed that if you placed a question on a website, you can finally get behind bars and left out in the cold.
The Federal Security Service shut recently countless bogus websites and buyers who want to buy weapons, the service are crowding into the net.
"The people are like hungry fish at the feeding and land in Siberian labor camps and not digging coal," he says.
A Makarow for $100
The purchase of illegal firearms is expected, according to experts, with prices ranging from 100 to 900 U.S. dollars.
According to the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitri Kislow, you can buy a Makarow pistol type for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is spent in military arsenals of middle-class supervisors.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences with illegal arms throughout Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand back, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives and devices fell by 7.8%.

In the US strike fast-food and supermarket employees
One in four American teenagers sitting at one point behind the box office of Mc Donald's
In the past few days came across the United States to massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains like Mc Donald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will swell further, or whether they will soon return to the air.
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist organizations.
In addition to the increase of modest wages of the organizers of the protests following simple Walmart- and fast-food workers to form unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly union.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the millions of customers, the so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States Ausverkäufe four that sometimes to Handgemengen led.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, down their work and his along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targets are low and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart stores, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Why buy a lot of Walmart-employed only slightly paid at the workplace.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can sell the goods often only as good as the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain about severe conditions, such as a lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the protest on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the contribution for the operation of their own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employees, earned 9.5 U.S. dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company raised the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost 3.2 billion dollars Walmart.
This is about 1.1% more than they donate to pay now.
Walmart would fully popped the wage increases to the customers, every purchase they cost only 46 cents more in the future.
A year would be the only 12,39 dollars for more spending compared to today.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that it only came to protests in nine states and that the company made no losses.
The Black Friday took the next day in his shop from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, and during this period, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart-funds on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of left-wing banks post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees laid down the work and the protest action merely "another PR stunt" was the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York on where their goal but not Walmart stores, which are not desirable and so far lacking in this progressive city, but McDonald's and others were inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sell billion portions, and yet to be granted unto you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
The minimum wage is currently under federal and New York law at $7.25 an hour.
At fast food restaurants, the minimum wage will be increased gradually, but not too much, and received an average $8.90 an hour their simple employees in New York.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to manage in New York with so little money is beyond me.
There was once a time when nearly a quarter of all American youngsters after school stood behind the counter at McDonald's, however, the young people still live with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people complain that they have to manage with that wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, which began at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue on Thursday, demanding that the cooks and cashiers get a minimum wage of $15 an hour of fast-food restaurants, which represents more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They also demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The American law bans corporate management to stand in the way of that goal and admonish or fire union members.
On the other hand, the management is not easy for them.
But the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
There have been vocal protests on that day and in many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats said, including City Council member Jumaane Williams said: "McDonald's says that it sell billion portions, and yet to be granted unto you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support fast-food employees so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.
According to The New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the ground, not all of which by far are employed in the fast-food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize all mass.

"The brain is so far only moderately above list"
More recently, the popular among supporters of modern technology issue of the enlarged reality is usually seen through the lens of special glasses.
First presented a working model to Google in the summer at its annual conference in November, it was announced that Microsoft had also filed for a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
It irritates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual space.
- please describe briefly, which conducts research your group.
- We are looking at the interaction between man and machine, however, this would expand the borders of this interaction.
So far, the human race is largely stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens that can sometimes be touched.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and gamescom sensors are a step forward, and today is no longer Xbox sold without gamescom, as are all interested in motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although: The interaction has brought on a physical level is much more on the flat, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system) gets more data could be improved, the issue has not decisive.
We are trying to change that, work on real 3D display systems on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We have to fire our physical world in the computer world and make it more tangible.
To this end, it is necessary that not only the user but also its surroundings is detected.
Then we could supplement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
First and foremost, we should be happening this silly virtual reality helmets.
- What do you think about Voice?
It is popular, but it is not overvalued?
- you is certainly not the solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it would not always inform all others about his actions and intentions.
Any kind of interaction with computers is actually good, but each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the area of control of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight, instead of sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet, which registered the movements of muscles and bones.
It is still relatively high, however, theoretically could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But as a whole, however, the future is mixed management types, such as language and gesture.
- How it?
We would like to ask, for example, you can in this mineral-rich?
They say it and point it at the same time.
- Normally I say it simply.
Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can make at the time and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we need to be working in the near future, especially in the development of new sensor types, enabling it to capture reactions from people in more detail.
For instance, laser sensors can be, as they offer a good resolution in the deep, which is very important.
- What claims based on your work with the Xbox gamescom sensors on modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, a speed of 1000 fps with 8 Megapixels are not bad.
But the main thing is not the technology itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this sense, all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only along the dissolution of the X-, y-, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and the number of frames per second is also important.
The movements of people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 fps especially for gestures are too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 milliseconds, which are closer to the modern commercial sensors on the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much that affects the interaction between man and machine.
I needed for my work as a device to control only without contact with more frames per second.
- Müsste will not increase the number of cameras?
- gamescom is currently working with three "cameras, and one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
A flexible, gamescom-like system in which we could play with different camera inclinations would be nice to see how that helps us in a position of three-dimensional investigation.
- If I remember correctly, in contrast to Google's glasses, Microsoft is not the public.
Do you not think that, in view of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life, the lens has the best prospects?
Of course it is not pleasant to go over to keep a smartphone in the hand, but I think the following: The neatest solution would be a "temporary" enhanced reality, in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone,
The lens is its strength and is a personal gadget (private) can only see you, but also its weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevented that you can work together with others on virtual objects.
- positions us for a moment, that not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal accessible in the air is the manipulation of virtual holograms.
There is a problem, often point to the critics of this idea: There is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers will be your group at this point?
- In my lectures, I have often said that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of second-hand as a rather unusual projection document.
It takes pressure perfectly true.
But there is also technologies that are actually designed to give something tangible to the "pictures" in the air, for example, produces the interference directed by some ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak at the moment, as these fallen someone over the knuckles.
There is also the wrist bands, the acts on his fingers in the nerve endings, this is also a potential direction.
- Do you tried to outsmart the brain?
If there is something to think that it should feel what it felt?
That is a good idea, as we have not yet tried.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, namely, a man who is physically located in a closed room to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; we are working on treadmills with concepts (other than in gyms), mobile platforms, as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can be only moderately rich years through lists, and a lot of work ahead of us.
This makes the work for a researcher in the field of virtual reality so attractive: On many issues, we are just at the beginning.

Personal taste rather than culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing the "Petersburg avant-garde" project, which is dedicated to urban residents, who form the vanguard of art and culture.
On the select list landed already high-level representatives of the Petersburg scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The extravagant artist Kirill Miller is the new Rosbalt held.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded, dressed in red, the times were the Russian Museum, once the summer garden, found at scene meetings or at openings.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social and philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the Petersberg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man by his presence on the streets of the city and all thanks to his fellow citizens smile and ensures good mood among them.
Recently he snapped up a barrel organ and became St. Petersburg summertime because he felt ready for this difficult role in terms of its artistic life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you usually in red and not for example in turquoise or yellow in the city on the road?
I have chosen the color red as fashion designers, which deals with the look and the image.
In this world, the compromise between artists, image consultants and society is red.
In the company raises everything differs slightly from the gray norm, aggression and bad behaviour.
But through my provocation with the people I want to get involved.
Any of my past provocations was an invitation to talks.
- When you knew that you have to be painting?
- In an exhibition in the Cultural Palace main, were issued in my work.
I realized that I have to go this way.
Then came the old-time, but not officially recognized painter was at an end, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible.
I am friendly with the new generation of painters, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was "Pushkinskaya 10," and then was first closure.
I prefers to theater, fashion and music, really at all, except the literature.
- And all that is united in your kind clinic... It was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture where artists should assemble the best creators.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical and artistic club for the Boheme until the renovations, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: Tequilajazzz, N.O.M., and I also remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
Simple string and his friends sang songs to the play-back, wore tight shirts and trendy composer Igor Wdowin today was one of them.
When the group began to play live, it was "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the age of "Halli Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it was his great career, but he learned the basics for us.
Even the gallery "D 137" or the "Griboedov" club have their origin in the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a poll, when it came to the award "personalities of our city" in the press.
I won in the category of "artist of the year," and I was reached at the peak.
It is not easy to work in the new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In this day and age, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: You can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
- Your work have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the timeliness and sharpness of thought.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian museum as a" clown.
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was socially, but now it hurts and is afraid to be so.
In a clown blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world, by requiring that everyone has to disguise completely.
Now respects everyone on the clothes and is based on the exterior and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps we should do not provide a person but should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
Recently we saw you in the role of urban-organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
If not me, then who?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
Before the other large groups formed the people: The Bohemians loved the One and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not one hundred-dollar note that everyone likes it.
Now you have to consider if you'll like.
Every cult star now has about 100 supporters.
- At the appearances of Stas Michailow come as several thousand.
- To abandoned women get him where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
Around 300 people and not 10 thousand for cultural reasons, so there is less money, management, and everything is based.
I did not destroy supporters, and the most important thing is that they do not cheat and what has been achieved.
In my youth I have painted these pictures that a collector even hung in the works with a number of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that usually come only at the end of a career.
Nowadays, there are many misunderstandings.
It means intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money refused to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
Petersburg - Kirill, what is missing?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real tsars it was different, because the Czar may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what might be the experts, but they will be barred because it requires more high-level experts to evaluate the former right and make their way free.
Now counts only the own taste.
The same is true for the Erarta, but with the difference that they say in all honesty that they will not accept any contemporary art and a painter, so we have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
Petersburg - is not the European capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can grow hard on the stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writer than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art needs to be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg

Born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or killer asteroid collision.
Caravans of spacecraft with Erdbewohnern aboard ship on the search for a replacement.
In order to save the human race, the important question is how we can breed in the weightlessness or on the spare planet?
Many choices do not exist in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could live at least hypothetically.
"namely Mars and Venus," Vladimir Surdin says the scientific staff of the Sternberg astronomical Institute.
While the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, however, has a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be in high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The question of reproduction in space, the researchers treated first in terms of the flora.
A half-century before that have already been carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit differed not in the least by the alien species.
The breeding of insects, followed closely by tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It is a normal chick.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chicken must find its footing; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground on the chicks beat wild.
Ten hours later stumpften fully from the instincts of a newborn.
The chicks do not respond to light and sounds.
They just died four days later.
"twice we left chicks hatch and keeps the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychew stuck to the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding kennel with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, it will be located on the "Bion" Biosatelliten only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilized sent into space.
In principle, it was found nothing special.
"That was just with the Biosatelliten, but again, it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue," said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing space rats got offspring.
The issue of reproductive directly in space, we have not solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are being ripped from their natural habitat, simply cannot follow their reproductive instinct.
Unlike animals could be the man as a matter of principle.
Homo sapiens is capable to abstraktem thinking and can generate a similar emotional backdrop.
For ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was for Tereshkova.
The most important possessions that humanity has is the female body.
The gull flew away, and no one on Earth could answer the following question: It is about the space flight?
After this flight, they can bring a child into the world?
"Finally nobody answered the question," said veteran guard Tang Watschnadse space.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, a cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 came the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja twice was in orbit, and even work outside the space vehicle Nighthawks, a son.
Nevertheless, it remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonaut with which, after long flights, everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Poljakow, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet the human race needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and create artificial gravity.
The hydraulic laboratory in the cosmonaut preparation center is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.
The cosmonaut routine win here in a state of flux for the work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults water perceive as pleasant, it is a foreign environment, but babies have water as a natural element.
It is as if the small store Ichtyander testimony from that life in the country rose to the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can more easily get used to water.
In principle, that is logical, because from birth until the first swimming take just two weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While the weightlessness for a newborn child is so much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness the pelvic and abdominal muscles is extremely fast back and thus also takes the ability to extract the child.
Well, we treat the birth of a senior aid.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber in order to squeeze the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung feel, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be set as an adult for training in a pressure suit in orbit.
It is simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment that we make together, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will mean that we will get a disability, a perfect unangepassten people to the world," says the director of the Bioethics Commission ran, Igor Pestow, ahead of the Institute for medical and biological problems.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is just a theory.
At some point, it will be a reality, when the people in their space ships leave on a distant planet, which is a home for their offspring born in space.

NKÚ chief: Control of the black-system failed because of a fault of politics
The Czech Republic has good monitoring bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls back in their application.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz says that the vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav kala.
"A law is not perfect, but it must be applied properly - and this is not the case with us," commented in my view of the current situation.
On a similar result is apparently a common control by Czech and German investigators.
As a bad practice, he brings the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "black-system."
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS employers would not bother with controls - is the system that is now banned or allowed?
"A law must have valid, and if something is illegal, it cannot simply be the chairman of the government, and impede the Kontrollamt, whose duty is, after all, the monitoring of compliance with the law in his work," kala Festival.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee of the Chamber of Deputies spoke about a joint Czech-German project, under which the laws of both countries were compared in terms of public contracts.
What were there in concrete terms?
It is a parallel examination with which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a matter that the European legislature decides how to handle public contracts to build the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this, we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation is not yet complete, we could see very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even more "strict and perfect," but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. It must also deal with the proper application of the law.
How can you be a help to the project? What emerges from this project for you?
Such joint control could help us to stop us constantly perfecting the laws and to seek the reduction and balancing of thresholds if this seems not very positive impact.
Economy means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price to acquire) and exclude illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But orders for the lowering of thresholds does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is also the case that the system in this way, we only "with" excessive paperwork burden, and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
With regard to the authorities, the German counterpart to the Federal Audit Office NKÚ similarly structured like us and also has a college that will be formed only slightly different in principle, however, both authorities are similar.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, where Germany, however, is a state, which means that they are also in the various states of auditors, in it, the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funding, which is in line with our state funds.
Public funds to be managed by the counties and municipalities are subject to the control of the country of auditors there.
As regards the German legislation, is easier than ours?
In general, I would compare this without specific information only reluctantly. Nevertheless Germany in some ways is often described as a model, and we certainly cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
The auditors is perhaps because there are better?
This is not, but as I said: I may not particularly like such comparisons.
It is worth noting that those countries which are a model for us, too, is also struggling with problems.
Otherwise they would have nothing of cooperation with our authority, is it not?
With regard to the Czech legislation, already feel the importance the revision of the procurement law for your authority had any impact?
Given that this novel is only a short time in power, they will not yet made in our tests.
Count here with some delay because our controls take place later.
Minimum impact so far more in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and with this nearly 14,000 public contracts - examined and analyzed the changes of course, as the thresholds will change the conditions for certain types of calls have been modified.
You see the passage of this bill rather positive, or will the system burdened with additional bureaucracy.
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
It can occur at the problem, however, that the rules are "strict" and can no longer be met.
Under the previous rules are a test unterzogenen people accountable to the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) so that any breach of the procurement law amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it reasonable to make the bill even tougher?
I think that is not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, not punish those who have committed an error that has no impact on the real decision-making process.
Such a system is only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We first tell which way is not effective.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS employers do not have control of the so-called black-system "would be something, what exactly does that mean?
The black-system is now allowed or banned?
A bill must have valid, and if something is illegal, it cannot simply be the chairman of the government, and hinder its activities in the Kontrollamt, whose duty is, after all, the monitoring of compliance with the law.
He can say: 'We change the law and allow the matter, "but he cannot say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The allocation law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions, and that is also true for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also a tragedy if, with the best bid, the offeror will be excluded solely because of procedural mistakes.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, and that is what I think is missing.

Our concerts on Šimon Ornest: Do we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the fact that the doomsday will take place in less than a month?
This is one of those emergency messages that we humans like pounce.
With our band The tap tap make more fun of them and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the doomsday.
In December, you also realize a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide charity event, which we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21, at 11: 10 a.m.
The day before, that is, on December 20, will be held from 21: 00 p.m. at three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, in a time zone, about 12 hours ahead, the Mayan calendar ends.
This idea comes from whom?
Then we have the idea developed jointly with our designer Honza Augusta, originally think of me.
We do not collect enough positive energy, in order to prevent the doomsday, but we would also consider together with the public in what state we pass this world for our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have developed a unique collection of T-shirts, shoes, bags and key supporters against the doomsday, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz we can also support the people.
The band The tap tap also has the so-called anthem, together with other performers included with the title "Armageddon" falls against the doomsday.
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. They will also play at benefit concerts?
Of course, at the end, provided that all is fine and the doomsday is not taking place...
The anthem should be sung by all the performers on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns together in a direct circuit by Czech television broadcast live.
The text Xindl X also sings the anthem by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the clip, with...
How did you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other people of the Czech culture scene that this implies that we realize many charity events and concerts.
We try to incorporate these people hard in our projects.
It turned out that most interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds benefit concerts against the doomsday?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo that we work together with the association tap the Jedlička Institute for six years before.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly maintained by teachers who help them at different activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to visit the editors, we want to help them in this way.
In connection with the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a private building, in which we have with this project should move in.
Each concert occur several groups and performers.
What criteria do you picked them?
We wanted to create a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague occur, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Eye, The tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "big events" are also planned for the future?
In May, we stand for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are ever in the United States, would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Its overseas plans are not just small, you are so far have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, the tap tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it first seems.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold, and we must, of course, many instruments suitcases and other baggage mitschleppen...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that sometimes I have surprised some.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there have been no problems.
By travelling abroad you have a comparison, as it looks in the various countries with accessibility, how it treats people with disabilities.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its early days.
Moscow is absolutely not accessible to Prague. It is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair alone is underway in the city centre.
It is not even there it goes without saying that a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator Newport.
Fortunately, there are clubs trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things that we are behind.
But this is still noted that an improvement in the situation depends on the efforts of the parties concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities can use self-employed in public space, go to the museum, toilets etc.
It is just not customary for a larger group of disabled people there is we are actively involved in the public arena with the band The tap tap the West a bit ahead.
Respect among the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when come from our ranks of prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change.
So far, these are only cases of strong personalities will in particular.
Tap tap is currently very popular if we take a couple of years back: What did you motivated in 1998 to form a band?
Then I started as a manager at Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested to deal with something hard.
And since I am musicians and young whites, among others, play, I founded a music-AG along with a colleague.
Oh, and by the time is that, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs).
The band was known, but only in the last few years, are we not?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also begun to advertise active for us.
We become aware that if you are doing something and this is not visible to the outside world, its own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also make good editors, high-quality machines, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it with The tap tap so far?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that we can deal with things differently.
In show business today often copies of the others.
This is logical in its way as anything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of the spectators usually is, of course, pity; this is only natural.
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature, we would regret it.
There are people who can develop and live a normal life, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities achieve something, this is a step forward, not only for themselves, but for the whole society.
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a strong leader, as do many people hear?
If you want to do something well, many things in one should not compromise and must also demand a certain discipline.
But it seems perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with romantic notions, and if they see that they have twice a week trial, must complete preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then transfer the enthusiasm among many quickly.
That is how it works everywhere, in every band that work seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The tap tap has 20 members.
How many of them were present from the very beginning, since 1998.
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. We cannot prevent that.
Who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome to us.
Place Thursday, the day before the predicted doomsday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues are: Incheba Arena, Prague, Czech bands and other musicians Fléda / Brno and Ostrava / Plynojem; 12
All three venues are interconnected via live-circuit at the end and it sounds a common interpretation of the anthem "doomsday comes from" the band The tap tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional disabled training center that will be created under the name STUDEO Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK
Admission costs 400 CZK, children under 12 free tickets are available from Bohemia ticket in advance.

Poland and the space.
Last week, the 20-member, Poland at a ministerial meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency, ESA this space agency, Poland is the second member state from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member.
Poland began in 1994, and participated in several in the following years, close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA projects.
Poland's journey into space began but much earlier.
Before World War II engaged Polish cosmos impressed with the space, but they are not always cast in understanding.
I recall, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought presented "entrance to Outer Space Exploration" for his pioneering work.
The ideas of the young engineer (nee 1905) left the audience cold, however, and after years remembered Šternfeld yet that only Dr. Gadomski Jan had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to Outer Space Exploration" the Prix donated by André Louis Hirsch and Robert Esnault-Pelterie rep deer.
Dr. Gadomski Jan (1899-1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in national magazines and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of space was hailed by the fact that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Already an inoperative railroad was built in Poland in 1925, was scheduled for a rocket propulsion.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remain unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or should be used to slow the trolley.
The details come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rockets and bullets.
The research led the institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia.
It is clear from the traditional documents that research had penetrated to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted, however, by the invasion of the German army.
In 1937 appeared in the trade press the draft by Ing. Rohoziński photoelectric hunt rocket on, and the following year was the work of "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba Krzywoblocky-Leliwa lotnicza" of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war were all projects for the military use of missile technology scientific advice from the Temporary Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet coordinated Doradczo Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, however, after two years of work, his work was finished by the start of the war.
Other articles appeared to space after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (ANRO received Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is dedicated to the four major items of space in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in 1954.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of an aerospace company.
At the time there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was clear that the future would have the exploration of space.
Since its inception in 1956 sought the Polish aerospace company PTA in order to join the International Federation for space travel, founded in 1951 and the PTA has actually been ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year was the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
This post he had held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 participated the PTA instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM 1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was made on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 pounds.
Started in 1959 and later became an improved version, the RM-1A, built in the two-stage rocket with flight tests the Bledowska Desert RM 2.
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another development stage should already be in a position to make real scientific work - the missile RM 34 should be used for the observation of high winds and reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km.
In 1962, however, was set to the further development.
The first rocket of the type RM successor was the meteor-1-Rakete developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its length was 510 cm and a starting weight was 32.5 kg.
From this rocket were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) to distinguish themselves from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rocket had a transport room with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1B about 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C about 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude was 37 km at all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 has a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 miles.
The versions were then built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Poland's joining the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research, followed two years later the establishment of a National Committee on the COSPAR) in 1960.
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos inter-program with Soviet satellites in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miro Law Hermaszewski after the Czech cosmonaut Vladimir Remek second Inter.

The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work.
That decision provoked a lively discussion among the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital that goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages), there will be price tensions.
Under this concept is a condition to understand where the manufacturer is trying to insist by importing cheaper goods in economic competition in the competition "undercut" in order to seize a larger share of the market and to increase its profits.
In a large-scale means that for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap there, or to give up their business, and the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs.
Since the private capital needs no social responsibility and therefore bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, rising government spending.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and to replace this society of economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well known, so precise statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in which governments are forced to engage in competition with each other in the individual economies to artificially lower the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments will deliver its own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly true in modifications of existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in terms of wages.
This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment and on the other by restricting the rights of workers.
The results are growing poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
Germany has been around for a number of years public food distribution points for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of victims is already in the millions.
In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is on a regular basis to cases in which such a low wage workers maintain that the state must increase their income by subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of auxiliary staff working in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures virtually all the EU's southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society, and we hope that some private investment capital is flowing into the country.
Here is the question of where this capital comes from nature?
If it comes from another EU country, only moves of poverty from one country to another, or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees are working for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state should not involved with capital of its own economy, and that a planned economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital insisted blinkered in its position that the state should not interfere lenkend in the economy.
Then you have to ask, however, if not the private capital of the policy and that affects the entire state in our own selfish sense or even draws.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, reciprocal privileges, a law in which virtually everything reprehensible, but nothing is punishable by law.
The situation is such that a State Department without private finances closely interdependent with the industry in Germany right companies charged with drawing up draft legislation.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The violence is no longer from the people of how to declare the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
Apparently caught the liberal democracies are currently in a situation as it quickly Appian describes in his book on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius': "The state has long understood the collapse, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, through illegal bequiles of benefits or with stone and sword.
The corruption proliferated already bought votes with abandon, and the people went to the polls... "" people with character is not applied for positions, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline. "" You really started to talk about it that the only medicine in this difficult situation is an autocracy, and that a strong man should be chosen "Appian thought is to him, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who replaced the democracy on a permanent basis by the autocracy.
As it turns out, is based in today's society, as well as in ancient times on the reckless preference of own benefit without having to pay interest on the whole society.
By its very nature, the private capital is not able to recognize and enforce the benefit for society as a whole.
Today, as then, the result is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not strive for deeper reforms in the least.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore look in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current situation, the demise of the regime in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as some pause, in the next round is already apparent.
The fact that today's elites in the future is particularly disastrous loss witnessed by hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance face.
The repeal of the law on charitable work here is no solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of European and global economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population down.
Therefore, this trend is due to system.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of the people on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital into the company in favor of the state.

Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
"... that nothing comes from violence, or ever could emerge" Fragile, "Sting sings in the song, whose main chorus verse reads... so that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"When my sons wanted no wars, there would be no," says the dying existed Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions.
Some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they support the Palestinians as terrorists; others argue with the racism of the State of Israel, the Palestinians, with the genocide perpetrated in the Palestinian Arabs and describe the state of Israel as terrorist.
At this point, I would not write about who is guilty and whoever victims in these recurrent waves of killing; in the end, today's residents of Israel, including the self-management areas have been born in the current political situation and have not even seen the start of the violence.
It is me about the readers to open a look behind the scenes, the look, whom the voltage 95 years (counting the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are particularly useful in the small patches of land in the Middle East.
My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are derived from and go from my own understanding of who or what group of people greatly influenced the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can make Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether there really were always these figures themselves, given their moves autonomously, or whether someone behind her throne was directed at a vorbestimmtes goal of their actions.
We have to admit that we live in a time where the wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals in the world, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Under this astronomical rich families is a particular, which could be described as the head of the kraken (I don't know if anyone else stands above them, I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
Much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century, in order to prevent the connection with criminal acts of its name, stood in the background is the consolidation of power, the proliferation of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all banks in the world, and to the countries where they are not involved in the central banks to wage wars or equip themselves to this (7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, it was five countries, before the attack on Afghanistan after the ouster Ghaddafis remained only four, while Russia has accused the central bank of the Russian government in the meantime.
Whoever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as the central bank began during the civil war, was assassinated in 1865 in a theater and publish their own (read: State) notes.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression.
The global appetite of the Rothschilds led by Albert PIK, a Masonic in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the unleashing of three world wars of the 33rd and highest level of knowledge.
The first war aimed to eliminate the big royalist states of Europe, by the second war should be broken in Britain's colonial rule, and the third war aims to reduce the global population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comfort and luxury and would not create as many resources), a universal religion (of ecumenism is nothing more than the prior) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method, in which the group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer for a solution (from Chao - is the order from the chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see foundation of the Fed to prevent crises like the recurrence of them triggered in 1907).
After they had succeeded Ferdinand in Sarajevo by the assassination of the Hapsburg heir to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the war was Czarist Russia no longer needed), then followed the dissolution of the Central European power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to spark World War II easier, the bankers could create a latent conflict by politics, by Germany occupied with huge war reparations; thus they created the condition of impoverished masses, so they had to cheer the Germans but a strong enough leader, named for the culprits and simple solutions offered Czechoslovakia; another factor was the creation of the multiethnic state with a strong German minority that should play the role of a fifth column and also took to ignite the fire of war.
At the end of the nineteenth century initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, a branch of the Rothschilds sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as in the historic area Judea with Jerusalem as its capital, the return to Zion.
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether the chain of Hitler massively, in which he had initially thought the international bankers, or if everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, as well as the war reparations against Germany, the ground has been prepared for World War II, the declaration of the state of Israel is the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, the Jewish people will be similar to the victims of the Second World War in the battle front line, this time with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country, but also internationally (think about how sharply divide the people of supporters and opponents of Israel.
Who is the victim and who is the culprit in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, which causes wrong, just wrong in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning?
One must distinguish between the people of Israel and its leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel as well as us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fragile fascism, the international bankers loyal dutiful politician who does everything for it to ignite a war with Iran, in the face of Iran's membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly spread to a global conflict, and with it because of Iran's control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil supplies run could come to a deterioration of the global economy.
In the words of David Rockefeller as the light of 1994: "The only thing we need is an arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population is a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted in the birth of a chip to subject the essence of total control.
"And it is that the kids and the adults, the rich and the poor, the open and the servants all give themselves a malt oaks on their right hand or on your forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he voted for the malt oak, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is a wisdom, anyone who has reason to put the number of the animal.
Because it is a human figure, and his number is six hundred sixty-sixty. "

The film Argo: If the worst is that Hollywood's call
In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime.
For the American government, there was no good way out of this situation, they could not afford to jettison the Shah, because it would have damaged the trust of its allies in other countries on a massive scale.
At the same time it was not able to secure the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
There was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of hostage liberation made it even worse.
Captured diplomats were finally freed after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which the United States led a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy was six embassy staff to flee.
It ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them to an extravagant story covering their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film Staff who allegedly visited a science-fiction film locations in the country.
Combining the genres
The plan developed by experts on "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, was also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
The camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in trade magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, at the same time, a so-called "Caper Movie," which is the story of a successful job (such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This will change the mood levels - the documentary scenes from Tehran on one side (in the title sequence in the movie iconic contemporary photographs shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations.
On the other hand, the loose parts come from Hollywood, which is ironic and easy to exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at a conference table, in the office corridors, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable start of his career.
From a losing actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third film after the thriller No snap (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is first film, who did not play in the director's native Boston Afflecks.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that this director's previous films from the standard Hollywood actors.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes in the movie play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity, and nevertheless conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when moving somewhere once the story.
A similar effect Affleck, with his team, with fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much plot in too many places
The director had to deal with this, the story is actually not many offers exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
He works with the little but quite successful, where he helps the reality for some of the time, then what is not always as elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a telephone conversation in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem a bit contrived).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is due to the need to show a lot of action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood employees are very charming, but their characters have earned more space, and that they are far from alone in the film.
Afflecks film is losing traction by something. It is a movie with some interest and it can approve the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years.
Enthusiasm, however, raises difficult.
As a reminder of a still living piece of history and proof of how exaggerated notions of the omniscient and omnipotent secret services, however, are in some way, but is it enough.

Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
Every year, a poll on the most ridiculous charges, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com exclaims, has this year decided to organise the contest idea from EU workshop "or" most absurd regulation.
"At this idea gave us the recently put forward by the EU's plan to introduce a women's quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher who cares about the organization of this survey, compared with the daily Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women, for example.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage because they represent a lower risk for the insurers objective in life insurance.
"More incredible incursions from EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote is then carried out by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher with.
One of the controversial EU regulations including the mandatory admixture of bio-ethanol fuel, which is damaging nature in its aftermath, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively low amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive on the size of hen cages, because of this year eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism in 1967, in the past, the prohibition of the use of the term "Butte bus line" or even a ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas have to be 14 inches long
The EU apparatus is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels, as a rule, are represented by one or more Member States (as attempts at the Czech Republic, for example, also with a veto-threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind the highest trading class that bananas in the EU should have no "curve anomaly" and must be at least 14 inches long.
The European Commission defended it on the grounds that they would hinder the fragmented national standards only harmonisiere trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables were softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries with the reminder that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
The EU regulation is potentially a candidate for the victory in the poll last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons in the sale with the reminder that children under eight years cannot inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU is the leading cause of the suffocation of children in accordance with balloons, citing an American study.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years already using Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious incursions at home
Quite absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - anyone who occupies an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) must instead say.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the association of liberal economists laissez Faire, in addition to the above absurdities, the EU regulation on the scope of food supplies in the territory of a member country.
The EU submitted to the maximum volume of food supplies, which was located on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic on pace for the specified volume for canned mushroom, and a large fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or to provide funding for applications for funding from the idea.
These ideas were certainly not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement to the EU, "said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (5) in the autumn of 2004.
He led in the argument that the grain harvest was very high and the state stores were crowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic have another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us under the Palas.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far ahead that they organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding for the communities of the Ministry of regional development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in concrete terms, it is a means for the establishment of aid money should be points to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception.
Regulations are in the Member States may easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts earned about regulation and hence effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, but rather recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, rather than the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were imposed in the budget negotiations by individual member states.
Emotions calls in this country is the fact that, like other members in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic could defend the title "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), a tradition dating back to the 1800s, had to rename our manufacturers, "Tuzemák".
The name may only be used for products made from sugar cane rum, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of diving in the company of famous feta cheese products registered in the EU and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham biscuits now of Karlovy Vary, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hop on.
With an EU trademark can brag because the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořicer roles.

"People want me to save the republic, but I'm only an amateur," Okamura said.
Senator, why is it on the idea to run for the office of the president?
I do not want to be president or senator.
If everything in our country would work without any problems, I would stand anywhere.
But I can no longer be plundered by the Republic for 20 years, as thieves roam free, while the people are increasing taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I'm already over 40, and to independent and belong to influence things, I have no other option than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
In the Senate, you have done it and then made off on the road to the castle.
It's not your constituents back?
I have said all the time that I will take up the fight at the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I have said that I will run for the office of the president, if I am elected senator and refined it.
My goal is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realize my vision.
For this I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate.
The problem is not only that we as a people shouting in the pub and in front of the TV, but turn down anyone who wants to make a difference.
This will confuse the freedom to lie with the freedom of speech and the media who want to rob the honor.
About me, it was claimed, for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was manager of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your vision.
The battle for the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as retrospective asset statements you have recorded more than 20 million kronor.
You need to change laws.
As President, you have no authority in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I argued that the guide remains a free trade, and it could be enforced.
The problem is the quarrelsome politics, if someone comes with a good proposal from the right or the left, this is deliberately rejected, and that keeps the population only on.
As an independent party or do I have a much greater potential to win support in all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of any party that can take what is best for our country.
Watch as a man in politics rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left.
For me, this right-left-thinking but completely irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or the right, I want to unite the people.
I always support publicly every good solution, even if it comes from the mutual or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
They dislike you, if someone called you populists.
But this confirm that what you just said?
If you draw up a business plan in a company, then you have both a vision and an ideal target.
And do you want to approach this.
You can call it as far as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world already, or they have been discussed by relevant experts.
But without support in Parliament will remain mere buzzwords.
And that does not go far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk long enough with people, you will be able to push through the material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other option.
To achieve these goals, to convince politicians, journalists and the general public and to try to bring them on our side.
As president, there would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to the statute book.
And the Angesprochenen would then possibly have to say why they oppose it.
A strong personality points to abuse can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, who was a virtue of public pressure.
I would like to say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started with the policy and try to find the support of the majority of my program.
I always try to assess the situation, and if it doesn't work then I go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can do nothing, and therefore I have discussed this with several well-known personalities, whether they want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with Jančura Radim, for example, but rejected due to overwork.
I have also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová that exposed the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
My candidacy I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters went to the polls not at all, and those who are left are usually elected representatives of the establishment.
We are thus only two independents in the Senate.
The people have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and chief men.
Are you considering the establishment of a party?
I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to review the past of each potential party member, and do not have the money.
I have not even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
You have no money?
You talk about financial statements, what would you be?
I value my private assets to approximately 60 million CZK.
I have a property with a value of 25 million, about 10 million for an apartment in Prague, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for a Škodu position, which is worth about one million, and then I have a few million and 3.5 million in the bank.
The Aston Martin was also a children's dream - James Bond always liked me, as he drove in a car, was published to women, and at the same time fight against evil.
They drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but you do not put your own money.
It is hardly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make some debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is probably not a great deal of interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senator close budget alone I could not live, so I like my son could not finance the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing.
Keep on working as an entrepreneur to have your livelihood?
You said that you will not drive back these activities?
But that is not cooperating with the wage level.
As promised, I have reduced my activities in part.
So, for example, my deputy managing director of travel agencies in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan saves the Republic.
But I must also live on something.
In what month income have you used as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As president, I would stop my activities are entirely.

The architects MVRDV show that the true adventures are not only in the head, in the case of Spijkenisse and the recently established books mountain, 2 photos
"I think the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," said Lisette Verhaig, a technician at the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby farm, says: "Nevertheless, it is beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man is still voluntarily in one of these old-style libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a little visit need special-record holder is sleeping city at the gates of Rotterdam.
The town of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest rate education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid thing, one of a few years ago decided to contribute to general education and the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro seem to be pretty bepinselte reinforced concrete miniatures clones.
The success of the educational offensive has not been particularly good.
And so did the city fathers that there was only one way, the statistics must be Mr: A library.
Winy Maas by the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of the foolhardy bar charts and producer of funny or often cynical buildings, appeared at the competition-hearing in 2003 and took the matter with the usual composure with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury is still intrigued with his shoulders and looked around helplessly, Esspecially a five kilogram box of dry dates of cheeky Maas his fine jewelry according to the size of a pyramid and ended his actionist founded speech with the words: "Dear municipality."
This is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse books, he, therefore, for the so-called tailor-mountain.
Nine years later, the 30 million euros is expensive mountain Rwy14.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes garage, supermarket, post and a couple of adjacent living and terraced houses with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books with the second prize was awarded "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award in 2012.
This is the faceless small town retort that until now no longer had to offer as a postmodern pedestrian and disbelief ugly town hall, behind its white facade, one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: Books Eldorado bubble.
There is a lift, which runs right through the mountains, but the real space and reading pleasures are opened to within reach of the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the ceramic clinker soil and elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square.
The urban setting is perfect.
Boys and girls are already looking for a park bench, dog and playing football.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and is in the middle of a large, dark room, is the most uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have the classic room configuration on its head and put the reading area from the inside to the outside world.
The interior of the book "is shrewdly: In the middle are central offices, internet library, Chess Club, environmental center and home technology.
The black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall panels, sometimes parapet, times 220.000 Dollar is a particular pleasure.
Look, feel, and smell are foreign.
Even hardbitten architects and engineers unknown elements of whether offs shake their heads.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," said Joop Trou Borst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen farm one day came across a suitable waste from agriculture.
For many years is used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimetre thin plastic film as root base.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two seasons, then it is ripe for bulky.
For the library, the fleece, for the first time in this volume, pressed to four centimetres thick slabs.
Under heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, burden-material that smells a little after new cars and sport shoes after a little.
After 105 steps, we arrived at the summit.
At the end of nearly 500 meters long wanderings will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch dry dogfood and eingetopften Ficus trees in the literary cafe.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology, despite the many windows," says Trou Borst.
Will be heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the book mountain is under a glass fall, even on sunny days, the sun appears only briefly into the interior.
The broad wood glue binder, which are across the glass facade, serve as a shading and catch a large portion of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic of the IT industry, already dared the way in the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde to tailor-mountain soul even as Spijkenisses "long overdue."
The reason: The opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
That should be filled once the optical gaps in the library has not yet been fully stocked, currently 70,000 pieces, for the time being.
The concept has taken root.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation has some relationship to each inhabitant of this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only for groceries.
MVRDV managed those king discipline called identity calls the jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
So young and uneducated it may be.
Finally, this is a starting point for identity.

Szabo, "German must play a greater role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin that balances on a thin diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza does not.
Now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, must be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence, without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany is also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
That is because it is precisely his foreign policy shift away from the policy, which has been managed by the United States, in the direction of German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans find themselves trapped in the middle.
One expects them to play a more independent role, but that are not accustomed to.
I think they fumble is still approach their roles, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy than specifically from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, so from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different than those of other major powers and, to a certain extent Germany must protect its interests.
These interests have had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not alienating the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would not even want to attach too much weight, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, while it has abstained from important decisions, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps it will play Germany so that even some respect.
Because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for a veto.
There are some differences between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly probably has quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot defend this position in public, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy course.
Find it difficult in Germany, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side to agree?
I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
They just do it with the euro.
I believe in the future will play a leading role in Germany, Europe to push for a European position.
Of course, that is not easy for Germany, even for the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think that the Germans understand that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as a major international player - Germany wants to play a major role at all?
Or is the lead of Germany still difficult?
Germany is not yet accustomed to that is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it hard to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, because every time Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German feelings are free.
That makes it not easy to the Germans.
This is the old problem: You don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to their neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics continuously from the EU to fill this vacuum at the moment but not who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular, c'est la vie!

"brand protection" in China: If Armani and Puma are suddenly Chinese
Armani also is a famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind it lurks a term officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Yet it is protected as long as the actual name donors do not complain.
Even then, it is not clear whether they will get justice.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in copyright infringement in the Far East.
Every week a new case landed on my desk.
The imitators are already a few additional letters, so that they can register their brands.
So, instead of simply Lu-Gucci, Gucci, Prada Prada Kny register.
German companies will also be legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010 was the trademark Zegna DF protect Puma, a Chinese company named an art that is also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injured intellectual property is well known.
There are multistory department stores that sell counterfeit almost exclusively in the big cities.
Stalemate hole cases but are different: On behalf of his clients, he is against Chinese companies from the internet to officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
Women who are rich men fish.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"It will be bad for business, you have to fight it," stalemate hole demands.
"The brand is watered down, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The process costs of the affected industries and the financial losses are in the millions, particularly in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros a year is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go to the money.
Up to nine years can drag the procedure with uncertain results.
Stalemate hole reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints because complained after the long duration of the name had become the "market" reality.
If the plaintiff had bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money, because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the machinery maker Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker shine master.
The Chinese may still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely was originally a blue and white logo, which reminded on BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion maker Lacoste lost against followers in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, which the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The trademarks agency CTMO in Beijing, is that there have been shortages in 2010 due to lower personnel and facilities.
Last year was one of the "emergency in the workflow returned to normal."
So is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals have decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have completed one, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting in the office still 81.500 objections to completion.
To confront this costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, when CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This means that China and was a record for the 10th time in a row, the list of members worldwide lead, informs the authority.
That also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011 had been taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
Simplified means that any registration costs an average of 160 euros or 1280 yuan.
To confront this costs many times, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the group's fight against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans could reach the imitation of illegal production of automotive parts was unearthed.
But secured the Chinese rights of followers of the Freudenberg brand.
We have failed this as surnames in Germany could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler says, the Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical spec-Ties in Munich.
The trademarks agency CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich back as well.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg may be right, but the process is fighting against continue to this day.
We must have extreme caution
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also said: "This case is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly put the company archive must have even see a hundred years through old records to prove them.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered a "high six-figure euro amount" of the other party in vain for a settlement.
"Because we see how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
Even after Europe zurückzuschwappen threaten the dangers in the Far East.
That is, when they grow unprotected brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration.
"You must be extreme caution," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole rates German companies tend to be very cautious in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, should the foreigners "everything that is worth protecting somehow register in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this will be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg in the last act of his trademark drama below deck, one of the other side should pay royalties for its own name, said Wentzler.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the segment in question.

Help World Aids Day: Noise, singing.
The choir rehearsing in Heidelberg Imbongi - and in Swaziland are AIDS orphans.
The story of a connection to overcome much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the feeling: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, pumps Ladies and gentlemen slipper on the parquet floor search to find the beat him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then emerging slowly in the voices of singers, soprano, ALTO, tenor, bass, lobby, greeted and follow up.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, makes it almost from its plastic shoes, even if it brings together with its sleek wild gestures.
It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg rehearsing the choir Imbongi a new song.
About fifty singers come between 23 and 69 years old, of human genetics, until Haussmann.
"om" Obani "is no easy piece, every voice choir has a different text and that even in a foreign language, Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
To help themselves
There are about 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide, estimates that UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on Aids Bekämfung.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Living in Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in Esitjeni village, the association has found Voices for Africa Friend in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child education money, school uniforms and a hot meal each day in the Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means to Zulu storyteller or even Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language fluently speak can sing, but nobody in this room.
For nearly ten years, the choir songs in this strange soft language and brings them from time to time and then back to where they originally come from, in the south of Africa.
Because air line from Heidelberg, 8 733 kilometers to the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents because they impose the hi virus.
In Esitjeni shows the kids that all Swaziland suffers: High HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male foreskin restrictions that can be reduced by half the risk of contagion will hardly be accepted by the people.
More than 40 percent of the people of Swaziland, the immunodeficiency virus in terms of dying with mid-30 is not uncommon.
In a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, discovered the choir of the village, in particular, saw the Imbongis many children at all, but simply on the streets, which not only lacked parental responsibility: Food, clothing, education.
Without a school in a poor country, it is certainly no chance.
In the beginning there was the personal commitment of individuals for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a hot meal a day.
But a year later founded the choir Esitjeni care for AIDS orphans in the club "Voices for Africa" almost professional since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
STI are frequent viral hepatitis or Talis salacious Humane Pappilomaviren, HIV, herpes.
Felt itch and lice are among the parasite STI.
Who are the most vulnerable groups?
Syphilis and Tripper come especially among men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of Germany reported syphilis cases transmitted by sexual contact between men.
When the dan Candidose (mushroom), Humane and Tripper Pappilomaviren frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases, chlamydia infections are heterosexual adults.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively small, however, accounts for about 20 percent of HIV infections in this group.
Chlamydia infections among young people are far more often than other groups.
After three quarters of all infections affect European surveys young people aged between 15 and 25.
Here are also frequent Humane Pappilomaviren among young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all the reporting obligations are sexually transmitted diseases.
The number of syphilis infections more than doubled in 1697 disease in 2001 at 3698 diseases from the Robert Koch Institute in 2011.
The number of new infections of HIV-goes back since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
The symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease?
The infections can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints to urinate, prayed with abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unknown.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but offer no 100 percent protection.
Partly because pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infection and narrow-body contact.
So experts recommend especially for frequently changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups.
Diagnosed early most STI cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir throughout Germany ersingt comes a lot together.
"Overall, we have already sent about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself manages Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive strong woman, the money from Germany.
She also cares about the orphans are well under at one of the grandmothers around.
The Gogos, how on Zulu calls the old women, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans in itself to give them a roof over your head and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear every day on time to the school.
Nobody has to come to the protection House Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as the two cooks cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa" has also launched a sewing school, organized jointly with the American health organization PSI and built two chicken houses that make many in the village have an HIV test.
That cannot be taken for granted, for obvious as the disease across the country is dead, they prefer to remain silent.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
King Mswati III, the last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned lifestyle that the hi virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms are on every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but the rarely used.
The culture is different - flesh-to-flesh. "
In order to promote the cultural exchange, travels the Imbongi choir every two or three years together with the South African and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, black self-esteem and confidence, which many at the southern tip of the black continent remaining from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of albacore, sing the songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings joy and mood, but has also been some fierce border soldiers a few tears off defies.
The trip is always after Esitjeni, where the singer visit their children.
Even if you find the small village on maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni, it is more than aware.
"Whereas after Esitjeni, because the light is" tell the people there.
And if the kilometre 8733 airline returns to Heidelberg, to the pounding singers in the rehearsal room on the old road, then it will also shine there.

Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet will probably be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there is frozen water there, as is evident from three studies published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the region are constantly lying in the shadow of the planet.
This is supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 feet thick.
The water is probably came from comets or asteroids possibly taken on the Mercury.
No one put the discovery of ice but associated with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon said.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have come in different parts of the solar system.
Probes, small robots and telescopes such as Phoenix are unnoticed by the earth people to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time send images to Earth: Small black holes in endless expanses.
The image comes from a camera, the German researchers have developed the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets in our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun beyond Neptune, the new definition of the International astronomical Union in 2006 after Ceres is no "Planet."
This picture shows an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope to detect a "family portrait" countless generations of stars: The oldest stars are as blue points are harder to identify the pink "babies" in the Stars County Hall.
This star-forming region, called W5 unromantisch by scientists, the Spitzer telescope has discovered in Cassiopeia screen stars, at a distance of 500 light years.
The Spitzer telescope NASA has taken this shimmering glow of a dying star.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star flung out in the dying process.
The huge Trifid Nebula, 5400 light years from Earth, new stars are born out of gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope NASA shot this photo of galactic birth room.
The Pleijades-star clusters, also known as "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
However, with the telescope will exploit the colors.
The Helix Nebula in this infrared photo looks like a red Age to the viewer.
He is light years away in the constellation of Aquarius-700.
Its resemblance to a half-continent brought this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infra-red photo ensures the spectacular color.
This baby star could be included in its full beauty only by the Spitzer telescope infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings that have emerged as this is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They are probably the remains of a Saturn-moon, who disappeared without a trace of 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and strongest images from the Hubble telescope: The whirlpool galaxy.
According to the color photographs of spiral galaxies are true works of art.
The recording released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The Trifid name comes from the Latin word trifidus (three) as dark dust strips the fervent heart of the birthplace of stars shared three divided three parts.
Carrier astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carom: 400 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of snakes down the seeds of two verschmelzender galaxies collide and will inevitably collide.
The birth of stars awarded the M83 spiral galaxies in the Hubble telescope.
Technical abbreviations like they do not lie in their nickname Southern performing name.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows an excerpt from the Iris Nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1,400 light years distant nebula consists of dust grains are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary dust.
This picture was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, took the Hubble space telescope for NASA.
The scientists call greater spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this fog is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new Young Ter.
This star-cloud, coupled with the rosette Nebula, also constantly brings new baby stars - 5,000 light years from Earth.
No dust, but gas still exists in this light bright galaxy with a small black hole.
Researchers suspect that it is only a short time after the Big Bang, when the universe was mainly to find hydrogen.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star watching a year later.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes were increasing - and the insights they deliver deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
Here in the picture, the mirror, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It will look into space, just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the capital of Gran Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone the mirror is at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The design disadvantage: The telescope is hanging in his elevation angle - and this limited in his mobility.
The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed at high angles.
His specialty: The high light collective strength.
Despite comparatively low levels in diameter, this is access to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) told researchers that space for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for extra-terrestrial trial Intelligence (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
The observatory view of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope - is worthy of that name.
With a total of four mirrors the telescope can shall include the medium-range.
Also on the Chilean ESO observatory is planned for the European extremely Large Telescope.
Its main mirror is expected to include a whopping 42 meters - and put together from just under 1000 mirror elements.
With photos, but is expected until 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna KEA, the Hawaiian volcano as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of 10 metres.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna KEA observatory that looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF alongside them.
Also on Mauna KEA is intended to create a new giant telescope with a mirror-average of 30 meters.
It is here to see an illustration.
However, the main impressions from space provides the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, extrasolar planets in the Kepler space telescope - especially for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that were identified 1,235 planet candidates since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the last documented start preparations on Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) until 2018 aboard the Ariane5 missile fired into space.
The primary mirror of the Space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that the Mercury ice at the South Pole also exists.
However, there are no reliable data, as the messenger is far closer at the North Pole revolves around the planet.
For decades, radar measurements suggest that there is ice on Mercury.
By the Messenger probe launched in 2004, the first which revolves around the Mercury, the scientists now have certainty.

Daily drink butter - and be 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people can reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country in the 97-year-old is still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people can reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country in the 97-year-old is still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The rumpelt minibus on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and lush, one would think that it would be in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan is just a few miles away from the border with Iran.
The South Caucasus Talyschen community lives here, about which little is known, except that it is perfect speaks Farsi and Aserisch and very durable.
Last stop is Lerik.
The small town flaunts to wuchtig Gera podría architecture of Soviet times, so do not fit in the picturesque mountains.
Tourists come from Europe hard here, the route from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too onerous.
Of the 323 kilometers takes eight hours because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik tourist attraction of this stuff.
"Baku became famous with Eurovision Song Festival in May, and in the next year, we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita of about eight dozen Talyschen documents from the area, the more than 100 Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
Fathered a child at the age of 136 years
But controversial star of the museum has become the shepherd Şirali Müslümov of 168 years old.
However, there is a birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented people was 122 years old appears Müslümovs age but highly dubious.
"in 1805, he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and should have had 23 children at the age of 136 years he had fathered a daughter.
Has Şirali Müslümov so charged in his age for a couple of decades?
But also the age at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Rembrandt Scholz, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"striking many hochaltrige people is also available in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "live in Sardinia too many very old men."
Due to the lack of documentation was, however, no scientific proof were needed on the age, especially as people stand Register.
Every day means cup melted butter
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik striking often reach an uncritical age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why are so many here in the South-aged?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explained that with the specific genes Talyschen.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
But for all the calories of food the Talyschen is to be as healthy meat, bread and milk products, in particular, love and many of them daily drink a glass of melted butter, appears from a nutritional point of view is not plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? Lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years for these latitudes, it is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wood house that is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor with a butter barrel, they tirelessly back and forth herrollt.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are now grandparents.
Two infants also jump around.
The guests of tea, which is served in the characteristic, belly-Armadu glasses can be prepared in the kitchen.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly in chains and member, under her headscarf conceals her long, dark blond braids, her son proudly unveiled in front of us.
I washed my hair always with milk, they were never made to me and kept their color.
"I have also never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to life
It has only ever eaten what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not once bought groceries at the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
By 2003, he was in power, his son Ilham later took the helm.
After all, there is no need of Azerbaijan's Old.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), gets Mirzayeva per month as a pension, by local standards, an amount that you can live well.
And, perhaps, has also been Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: "The old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the extended family will be loved and cared for and are happy.
If that is no reason to stay alive as long as possible

The word "right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is controversial.
The Egyptian president not saved with pathos.
We must create the transition.
"And it is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, in particular, as well as the Liberals, the Christian Copts, enlightened Muslim and secular fuels.
For all of them have hopelessly divided in a confused opposition are afraid.
Fear of God state along the Nile from grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said that Mohamed Morsi almost entschuldigend temporarily curtail the powers of the Constitutional Court, and expanded his powers, "in order to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles that dominated by the Islamist 100-member Constituent Assembly as a nightly, 15-hour Parforceritt were rushed through, some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also says in the draft, the case law based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is "principles"?
It was and is subject to interpretation and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the attendant legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
It will be held at least a newly guided article near: In all issues relating to Sharia should consult the Al-Azhar University, the country's main Islamic institution with great power throughout the Sunni Islam.
It is not, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which would result in de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Many in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also problematic: Civil military jurisdiction should further maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule on the suppression of opponents.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The state should also, as stated in the draft, "" protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote their morals and values."
That is legally formulated so vague that state institutions with the help of this article could even control the content of film art and literature.
In other words, this means nothing other than censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly prescribes equality between men and women.
It prohibits another to insult or slander the prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
What is an insult and how it should be punished, though, remains unclear.
The phrase "insulting people" should be banned is equally dubious.
Is there a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
Interpretation, like so much in the draft, the Morsi's signature before and after his words "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum.
"The revolution has returned."
The opposition has formed for weeks against the overwhelming power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to bring down the charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter leaning presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution "belong to the scrapheap of history."
He accused Morsi's supporters want to lead a "coup against democracy" via text messaging service Twitter.
"If the referendum he proclaims, we will go to his palace and oust him," said the opposition Jasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren is not punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not be trying to monitor, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to counter-demonstration, cautiously but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Bank in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafi attended and cried: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded by Morsi: "do the country!" and protested: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably have civil war provoked similar conditions.
Morsi's supporters apparently did not risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both proponents and opponents of the draft constitution would have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide through the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
The draft for a majority of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word 'rights is not even before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process should have gone until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because for him, and human rights are indivisible.
For this, he was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complained in the interview with AFP.
Morsi's expansion in all three powers in the state, the lawyer would resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Bringing to strengthen civil society, the president put them de facto aside," laments Saeda.
But a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels alone, also from the international community, the fight the ideological direction along the Nile viewed with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
It could be revenge.
A crowd at the Tahrir warns: "Your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."

Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but all over the world.
The secret of success in the country could have something to do with the local appetite on pretty badly smelling fish?
Take a selection of mature cheeses.
One place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave it there for a week.
Just about one of the great delights of Norway, one must imagine the nose section of the Rakfisk smell.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours drive from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that simply will not disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which is fermented in water up to a year, depending on how one's stinky fish would like.
When the darkness comes on the country and the weather gets colder in Norway, Norwegian flock to Fagernes in a celebration here, which is dedicated to this, well, really very impressive specialty.
"You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass aquavit," says Howard Halvarsen that actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General" also organized the festival.
Around us eat small fish cubes and business people to pass large quantities of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit over the Rakfisk," says Howard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I eat a few bites.
If it avoids to bring the Rakfisk near the nose, he is not bad - such as sushi, which has quite a long bus behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and fish in the autumn has been soaked in salt water barrels airtight.
In deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and eaten, undoubtedly with steamed through alcohol senses.
Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and migrated mainly in the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who have not long ago was far richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strictly fragrant part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But is it expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people seem not to care.
Here are still hates it, Anders Breivik by its proper name - the racist right-wing extremists, who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it applies only to the "incident" on July 22.
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in a peace-loving country is capable of such brutal killings.
Norway's prime responsibility for the current wealth is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien growth since the early 1970's of the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is so good for us," says Anna, our waitress round trays with seasoned Rakfisk distributed, with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes, embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are a prudent, as the saying goes, people.
Her English is spotless like that of most people here.
We are not quite a show-off, "we may not emerge.
Norway is very cautiously dealt with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years before the Great Depression threw money around with all that they had never gave Norway its purse firmly closed.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course Rakfisk eating," adds them with easy laughter.
I am in the snow and put me on a different court at Rakfisk - I have enough.
As a moose-burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat told me.
But the evening is back on the menu of the Stinkefisch.
The hotel in which I logiere, is one of several venues to organise a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging smell sense - fish.
There is a live TV broadcast to a show with fly clad master, which is surrounded by Rakfisk plates.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here are our points, Howard."
They are sharing and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish.

Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his inauguration, he analyzed the BBC's Will Grant challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic is especially bad in Mexico City.
Even on better days, this is an ever-clogged city, but a ring of steel was built on Monday, several important routes on the streets and in the capital absperrt ensures chaos.
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators in Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidents of binding and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon's Mexico can prove economically as well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives over the past six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week the US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he went on an equal footing with the US President, Pena Nieto act as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided over the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote village of Valle del Bravo reminds you like for example to him.
The holiday village residents attribute it to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can go on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that it once was.
His name with plaques hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel LA Hernandez, who works as a Member of Congress for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards the security and economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman LA admits that the party after 12 years out of the presidential palace of Los Pinos makes great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The allegations by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, rejects it.
He is a very direct guy, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, above all, he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view on their former governor.
The contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo in Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could not be greater.
The town lies hidden under motorway bridges and is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature.
At the beginning of this year has enabled the military to fight drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a corner fallow land near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico about 1,000 women - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Pena Nietos critics believe that he is not adequately addressed the problem of feminicide during his tenure at least.
In the worst case, however, his government have closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete, typical of the rundown district, fights Irinea Buendia with tears, as she shows me pictures of their dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
Her family believes, however, that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the rigid corpses had already deployed.
While her mother tells her story, looks back on us from the wall a picture of Mariana. It is appropriate in a cross that bears a single word: Justice.
But exactly this, so the family, have denied it until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, troubler, Nörglerin.
They want you to simply accept their verdict and mouths.
"But this is not possible if there were so many flaws and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday will tie the president, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families were affected by violent crime in the past six years, and the new president has promised, during his term, particularly to attend to this problem.
"I hope that as president he is the way he was as governor," said PRI Congressman LA in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.

The prosecution claimed that Bradley Manning was not complaining about mistreatment
The public prosecutor against Bradley Mannings accusations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing will deal with Mannings time in the military prison in Virginia, quan tico
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the indictment due to harsh prison conditions on
The operas of the US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecution has sought to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in American history, missed several opportunities to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military detention.
When cross-examined Mannings Erich Monaco during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein that documents had made weekly visits to the prison officials during nine months of prison time in Virginia, quan tico Mannings, had no complaints about his treatment.
The day before the cross interrogation that was held as a result of a request from the defense for the rejection of the indictment, Manning had been punished enough by the harsh prison time, Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then released by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning had filled in the forms, the officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the tico quan-military prison where he had increased from July 2010 to April 2011 under detention in Essen.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
As Fine interviewed him on Friday on the forms, gave Manning to that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as "very professional" as a whole.
The forms, so thin, contained no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officials had questioned Manning directly on his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, the officials have discussed this with him and given to deal with them, but they have not been logged.
"They wrote (concerns)," No problem, "debriefing on, and not necessarily meant that I said nothing at all," as Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why, when he met with a committee in January 2011, he is not about his treatment of values that should investigate the suicide thought he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied, his intention to leave during this meeting, it was downgrading its observer status to "prevention of injury".
The military said that it had given him this restrictive status, which is one level below the suicide risk, to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to get rid of the observer status on the prevention of injury and convince people that I was doing well (...) to be able to achieve a higher quality of life for me," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to the prison in July 2010 in Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before he was transferred to the Marine base quan tico in Virginia.
In Kuwait, he considered the suicide and was due to the heat to become unconscious, he said.
Not to be able to know what's happening to him, or in the outside world, had been wearing.
"My world fell together at Camp Arafjon, on the cage," said Manning Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was moved to quan tico, said Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
We have allowed him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he was trying to stay on the move, because the day had been forbidden to sleep or even added.
He always have to sleep with light, which moved into his cell from the outside.
If he had turned up at night and guards could no longer see his face, you have to wake him up so that he can turn back the clock.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the Mannings treatment.
In April 2011, Manning moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday asked the judge Manning also to an accusation that he had made in his statement on Thursday, so he had a night to sleep naked in his cell in quan tico and must be at a morning counting naked before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover up with a blanket during the counting.
In the survey on Friday gave Manning in that he had concluded his watch from a command that he should drop the ceiling, with which he might cover themselves, but he admitted that he had asked no one.
On Thursday, Manning testified that during the previous night, he was forced to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show an official that he poses no danger to himself.
Manning told the officials that he would have the federal government can use his underwear or his flip-flops to injure themselves, but this is not done.
On this night, Manning aus said, had been removed from his cell to his underwear, flip-flops and glasses.
His lawyers hope that the judge will drastically reduce his prison experiences at least take into account and his detention measure, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning is guilty of lesser crimes committed while other charges, which are seen as too extreme, are to be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend by the prosecutor is expected to justify the detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the rules that apply to all prisoners under the highest safeguards in quan tico Deutsche.
Among the charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
He is found guilty on all counts, he faces a life sentence.

My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control than me in perplexity spread.
Signs pointed to two queues: One for "Wochos (Mexicans), another for" Extranjeros "(" Aliens ").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic symbol - just as in Boston, my friends call "Irish" or "Italian" my friends in New York.
Later I decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or dashes.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to claim me in an interview that language at both ends.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not going on.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment after this week, as the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
All those issues were on the agenda, which is expected to meet the heads of these two countries: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy and is one reason that Mexicans today is just as likely to remain in Mexico, rather than emigrating to the United States.
He would like to ally themselves with the United States and Canada, and create a North American trade bloc after a model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun that forced them to leave more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans to think in centuries, not in minutes, memories of this event will not be overlooked.
Once that is a U.S. government official even mildest criticism of Mexico exercises, hears complaints about how the American press the sovereignty of its neighbour, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country.
And the children of Zuma's go on the war path.
Yet the greatest challenge lies in Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that, at a point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or parents immigrated to the north and was commanded part - no chance in Mexico.
And in most cases was that person a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have received good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred, but as regards our loyalty, this is not the case.
Clearly, this is the United States.
We are also aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican leadership.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
The Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
They believe that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they were not left.
And then we would not see caught behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and object to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are, and Mexican Americans take them so badly.
While she is a US citizen, they see themselves as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans that I know have the feeling of belonging to neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we will be seen as an American.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my visit, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: Some parts of the bourgeoisie education and Mexican leaders want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to represent their interests in the United States, Mexican Americans use as a temporary "ambassador" for Mexico.
We should tell our American colleagues about it, how great is a visit to this country and put pressure on the leaders to step up their ties to Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in the face of unfair income distribution, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it really is a great country.
I am afraid that you alone, amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge as their family members were treated fairly recently.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican," than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.
Amid the usual blame countless buildings to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza hit near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict changes the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally find the end of it.
A war that is neither lost nor gained
At first glance, optimism in the face of the current situation seems anything but appropriate.
Even if the truce agreed on 21 November continues, this week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have the Israelis pushed back, although his group even large losses.
Although the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip and killed several Hamas leaders in one of the most desperate and densely populated corners of the planet will be locked up, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah wins.
And the Hamas leader could conclude that they have time on their side.
So, as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas is rich and powerful friends can draw on their side.
Turkey, a regional power, a revival, which once regarded as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken the side of Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe Israel is an Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, to Syria, where rebels could be an increasing number of Misti scissors before Stürzung Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, the country is by far the strongest and most important Arab inhabitants, especially on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance in the region.
The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, Hamas verschwägert and their leaders with the Brotherhood is more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove to be Hamas as a player who cannot be excluded from Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, however, have an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no more danger.
Many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed and the Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome," has to prove its worth.
At least for a while, Israel can sleep quietly.
Keep in diplomatic terms the United States steadfastly stuck to its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest violence escalations.
Israel has been well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a great extent.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, the country remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the Sperranlagen run into the bulk of an eventual Palestinian state in the West Bank and that they will protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared contrary to international law, but continued to expand.
Netanyahu is good because his Likud Party, in the run-up to the elections on January 22 under Avigdor Lieberman, allied with a group of RISC Herengracht still fighting.
Why this nanny behind cunning Palestinians and left to their own state?
If they really had control of the West Bank, were it not just as their supporters in the Gaza Strip fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish, if you dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps it will be able to enforce the hardliners. But the Arab Spring may make them a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will focus first on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in the overhaul of its economy.
For the pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama set to achieve a cease-fire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
The Israelis also should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue to deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg that undoubtedly will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus in Tel Aviv this week exploded.
The repression undermines the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
Over the years, bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly calling for its diplomatic tribute.
Both sides need a push from outside
The answer is that, by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and will be represented by this newspaper: Two states, in which Israel surrenders areas for security purposes.
The small for the near future hope is that the cease-fire gives more power to enforce this solution to outsiders.
Egypt must now work with Turkey and Qatar is better positioned than ever before, and stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip to Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by exchange and a common area of Jerusalem, to convince.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
That would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama also needs to do its share to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he missed the idea of its own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were equally unwilling to participate in it.
But this is a regrettable, myopic perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Single cigarette packaging for Australian laws come into force
Health warnings and infected body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first single cigarettes and tobacco packaging laws came into force in Australia. Brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, prolific lid, which also printed with graphic images that show diseased body parts and babies and children infected by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the various health warnings and images is the only difference between the packs in the brand names that are printed in small identical letters from next Saturday.
This leads Australia the world's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian government wants young people smoking by the glamorous image of smoking is eliminated.
26 with the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke, with 99% match likely will also start after that.
"You can already see young age in children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to apply with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have a marginal impact on the profits of the multinationals, consider other countries have already taken similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
It was claimed that the laws would favor the black market trade, which leads to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater amounts of such products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra hectares of best like Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids on the cover of unbearable packaging has grown enormously, since the companies of British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Britain's, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago on the Australian Supreme Court in its ruling that the law failed.
Best like Zico, up to 6,000 units sold to wholesalers and waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good deal.
According to experts, the rub lies in the popularity of social media at exactly the group aimed at the plan.
A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, they may not act as sports sponsors and forced most traders interpret cigarettes in shops no longer. Now the advertising changed on the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and pages, but has no influence on international sides.
"Anyone who sells tobacco and has left only a small area, in order to promote its products, comes around the Internet does not," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in reports of experience to brands that have been written by "ordinary people".
We must ask the question: Is this just a private person who so enjoyed Marlboro cigarettes finds that it even begins a video - or has a marketing agency to do?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focus instead on marketing to deal with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions, though none of the countries has increased trade with Australia in the World Trade Organisation.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Plibersek said that the government has held talks with other countries to consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to give photographic warnings in 2001.
Meanwhile, they extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore it.
"It is simply a hole and put the box away," says Victor El Hage in the purchase of a cigarette packet, printed on a photo with a mouth tumour.
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operators of the tobacco trade "King of the pack" in the heart of Sydney, says the single packaging have hampered the filling its shelves.
"In the past, I needed an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu said.
"The government ought to ban cigarettes simply completely - then we said okay, that's it, we make dense," adds he visibly upset.

In a world of constant elektrisierten, it is nice to be bored at times
This Thanksgiving I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane unexpectedly failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about boredom.
I will not lie.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight that is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping is available.
But more and more academic and child development experts lead to boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us, and our children, to be bored at times.
So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, which promotes creativity.
And because most of us today almost constant stare at a screen or another, we will no longer serve the benefits of boredom.
We should therefore welcome with open arms the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
This brings me back again.
Like many people, I always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada is the problem that has been discussed and boredom defined in many ways.
After a long reading of the presentation of the idea in a focus group of about 100 people and research literature Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience, "to be able to do a satisfactory job, this is not".
Boredom is different from apathy, so that the person is not busy, but this would be.
At the apathy, on the other hand, there is no need to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of the process of attention, coupled with a bad temper and a sense that time passes slowly."
You can almost hear it as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that could be related to these two states, bored people see the problem in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves and their surroundings.
Sometimes, we believe that is boring to us, even if we just have problems, focus on.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention" - in English: "The idle minds: The definition of boredom in the context of attention," which appeared in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science "in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point on an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a tape in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television program from the neighboring area that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group never heard this noise.
The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to concentrate, wrote to the difficulties of boredom and could find no reason for this.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, however, you put a dreary activity, "as the search for defective products at a factory conveyor, can distract music and help to feel not bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that can fight Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people remain physically attentive.
Studies have shown that children keep herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still, "said Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually dull - my late flight, a dröhnender loudspeaker, a particularly ermüdender film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "vulnerability" scale for a long while.
On the scale are statements such as "Many things I need to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, Stephen Vodanovich, especially as regards the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quite a guyed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents contacted seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and in doing the homework, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3 percent of parents surveyed feel to bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increase or decrease.
He is sure, however, that "the young people perceived to be very boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Are you healthy?
Sometimes not because, in the extreme case, it meant that people take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many writers and philosophers study the relationship between creativity and boredom. This view is Professor Vodanovich researched the issue for more than two decades.
"With the boredom is the brain a saying that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not always know exactly what you do best.
If one is boring and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But television can have feelings of happiness in the short term, this flux but again in the long term.
A bored child is an iPad is enough, it can stop this from the boredom. However, it has not learned to maintain itself, or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Even if we do not see too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to get away from the constant activity and technology also casting home.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more boring, but boredom is the relentless nagging desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth is looking for a way to unwind and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated, find it hard to deal once the noise is silent."

In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the southeast of Colorado for a crime to justice, will soon be legal in this state, the possession of a few chunk marijuana and a pipe that he smoked it.
Orozco said that he and some friends were in a car with it in third when they were stopped on the road near the border with Kansas.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, are excusable peccadilloes, each equipped with a penalty of $100, and received a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But he is also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, depends on the answer in hundreds of drug-related crimes less by the law than from the location.
Hundreds of the offences which will turn to marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures, has been dropped.
The police authorities have adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally permitted, once the new laws take effect in the next few weeks.
But in the more conservative districts of Colorado prosecutors have promised to follow up on existing marijuana offences and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time voting in several cities, from the Denvers suburbs to the Western Mountains to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. 2002, chief of police in Aurora, which lies to the east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington scratch at the head at a loss.
They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of December 1, 2013.
In Washington, it believes that, in any case, Colorado is ahead of most states regarding the regulation of marijuana. There, the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for private domestic consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore suitable for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Insurance for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, known as I-502, enters into force on December 6 and is also the end point is a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practical issues have to be resolved at this time - about how the government target of a "reasonable access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops should be agreed within 300 metres in schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"nowhere, it will be difficult to find a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed group.
On 21 November sent an e-mail, chief market its employees in Aurora, in which he said the prosecutor would no longer pursue people over 21 years in minor marijuana offenses, and that the police will seek "immediately" show no penalty for this offense.
Chief market added that the police will continue to enforce urban targets for the regulation of medical marijuana growers and traffickers continue to be pursued.
In Weld County north of Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he was at his office would continue to monitor cases of marijuana possession, mainly to persuade consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for the possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana on trial, although many have been prosecuted for other crimes.
"Our agency has an obligation to pursue violations, in which it was the sentencing issue was crime," Buck said in a statement.
Even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, the reactions are ambiguous.
The police in Grand junction, the largest city of the district, is no longer in the possession of small quantities for adults.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported that decision, but also decided to drop proceedings have not all outstanding.
"I do not believe that I waste my time to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions across the state encouraged a profound dilemma in view of the large green experiment among local officials.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendant in court for marijuana offences and acts as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for the legalisation that they still cannot accept," he believes.
The first states to deal with small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as a national sample of cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials prepare for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the Federal Government, which the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several spectacular more arrests of consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser of the Obama Administration believes that investigators probably will happen no doors to confiscate small amounts of drugs, but may be reluctant to condone the legal under the new legislation, government-regulated marijuana shops.
Several towns in Colorado are just not waiting for the federal authorities act.
Even before election day some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana-shops, although they could open only in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a town in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone at the federal level, and then have a huge problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this legislative amendment.
We do not then and then for what the community has decided to what the government has decided.
There are many questions unanswered.

Petro nella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
It was always my biggest dream was to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once considered for the main temple of knowledge of the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester College in the late 1980s - there, I had intended to study history - I had my bags packed and brought about the first scandal of my life again.
My father broke out in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said, I would be gone, because I had a problem with it, that other students had sex in the adjacent room.
The author of A N Wilson said rogue, "I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because I was quite unusual name, or because I come from a private school.
We had harassed me for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment: My late father now Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher and I have been an advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right suffers from a similar pursuit.
The rising and organized hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection benefits the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College indicate they will personally attacked because of their political views, "often active in isolation and declared undesirable."
They call for a place in their college equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
The situation was exacerbated by a recently-tra aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, bright and on the Right," was the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It was shown, among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and occupied with silver suit and silver Gehstock protzte.
At other universities, conservative students say they are viewed as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, was left in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing trend in universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without having met us at all. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "embarrassing." the 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect the Conservative Student Association of Oxford says that it has observed a growing hostility toward students at JCR members of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first week in Oxford, I was part of such a minority.
I was a very shy 18-year-old arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted to give an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester-week, in which new students get to know yourself and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors the mockery of Tory students not only facilities, but even pleased took part.
Political issues such as a cut, the rejection of the government and the privatization of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found its way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
I was in my first event French texts translated into English from the 18th century on what should come next, I had not been caught.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled there.
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and quite invidious.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?," he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few French hours in your free time - in other words, if you are not too preoccupied with your social activities," soup like Pitt.
Back in my room, I returned with hängendem head.
On this evening, I sat alone in college at dinner, when I typed someone lightly on the shoulder.
It was the second year of a German student named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory is harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your dad is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first semester pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to distract me.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all counts.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, a conservative force had attended Eton College, said to me: 'You're the daughter of a fascist pig. "
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was dirty and perverse.
"As Tories sex?" asked me one.
To beat each other, isn't it?
I felt like homosexuals had to have felt before the liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I like-minded people can meet only after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me were extended to my inner eye to a purgatory of isolation and ostracism.
Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, was the only tutor, which was open to recognize as a Tory, which had its headquarters in my college.
Not only was he hated for it to be a conservative, but also because he had written speeches for them and advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him narrow and parochial and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997, he adopted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will be not happy here," he told me.
I started to move between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge on more sensitive friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the taken all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
Such a thing would never do not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends was always impeccable manners on the day.
Marred his moist eyes.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I am sure you only neckt thee.
It would break my heart if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakening.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and relinquished his convictions.
In the following week, another history tutor during a Tutoriums seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly in shame zerging, my parents gave me that I had undergone a "brainwashing" and called it "old idiot."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who was the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave my Häscher.
When they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a wine fan tail slack.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer under such intimidation and mischievous nature in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university, which not only produced 14 Tory, but still hiding behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino has elegance of celebrity"
Speaking on the occasion of "Valentino: Master of couture" exhibition, which opened in London this week, ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian Modemachers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has acknowledged at the opening of "Valentino: Master of couture," the designer, put together a magnificent retrospective, for the more than 130 haute couture dresses were created by the "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this building," he said with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a history, whose sole protagonist "il signore" Garavani, but without his distinguierte clientele, could not have been written.
Valentino had always fascination for the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, on Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece.
Valentino shows this personal memories as a trophy of his social ascent from humble fashion makers in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
To be in love with the nobility, must not be at a disadvantage.
"At least they tilting at your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from the music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two of them lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant host.
"We all rejoiced when we were invited in his house in Gstaad," explains the wife of "tired" Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Ramsgate Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
Yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza, too, do not forget the charisma of the Modemachers.
Many years ago, we went to his home for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At his home, every detail of decoration, the food and music, and his influence can be felt.
"All invited felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model" that began her career in the week of haute couture in Paris in 1995.
"He is never out of fashion, because his designs are works of art," she says finally.
Fashion shows of origin
Garavani's life is a story of an se discretion, rather of mutual love ties.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was turned into a glorious and 60-metre runway, which proposes a roller lets the user takes the place of the model and go along the catwalk to admire a beautiful "audience" that bears masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress, the Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, chose the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a coat made of wool and leather, which belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience from fashion dolls exude names such as Sibilla de..., Gloria von Thurn und taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Abascal Naty and the fashion-maker, 2006
Many of those customers say the first Valentino is like your first love, "unforgettable."
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I draw him above all others because of his great love for women and because it highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of flamenco.
I like the colors he used very; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leaders in the fashion Patricia Della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of it, once the age and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
Finally, at the end of the 1990s, it added.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was flying skirt and a draped bodice with a red dress with a neckline that makes his presence.
"It was a dream realized," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion from his obsession is timeless," explained the Italian Aristokratin who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d'Arenberg retained their evening dresses of Modemachers "with the utmost care" to "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the memories associated with them."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House, the wedding dress for the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion-maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to produce this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, 12 different embroideries and a four-and-a-half metres long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society."
For years with the "savoir-being tarnished" of the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the highest award of the Legion of Honour, combined Garavani so many honors, as each of the husbands of its customers.
"I will always be his refinement, his quiet, neat and perfect exterior noted," gives D'Arenberg too.
I saw him the last time before a month at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And it says a princess...

The most difficult job in the world: The human work animals from Kawah Ijen
For four euros are the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they carry on the steep, rocky trails 70 kilos of sulphur.
There are people for whom the work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn their living by retrieving sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the eastern part of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must rise every day down on the floor of the crater, where the burned gas from the earth solidifies sulfuric gas in contact with the air.
After he has broken out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds in total, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the final stone paths.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of age meters, but the weary carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, where they have to put their steps carefully and keep the balance so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that each step can cost her life, as she was a French tourist who years ago on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted.
The mine from Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur that reduce them.
On top of the hill, force them to run and shoot the way between the tourists like circus monkeys with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to balance a mining company has established a little further down to a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi (never rather) exploiting its workers and that the deposits in the volcano since 1960, which they 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur pays.
They then sold for every 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widespread and is used for the manufacture of string wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains us Anto that usually makes three flights a day.
He needed three hours for each course that he is completely done, he has at the end of the day but then 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such a seemingly inhuman effort is three times that of what he would earn working in the field.
"The daily wage of mine here, where the coffee harvest will be paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167), very high," said the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village in the area, and for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia, "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java, to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto puts his life on the line on Kawah Ijen for three years, has already left the first traces of sulfur in it, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I will be working here for two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This friendly and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could work as tourist guides, waiters or at the front desk of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of carrying Els.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and is on every morning at two o'clock at night because the sulphur tube where its characteristic yellow color in the dark bluish shines.
The shadows challenging, he rises in the light of a small forehead lamp in his helmet, which he bought with his own money, in the crater.
About 400 carrier load on the baskets with sulphur crater floor on their shoulders.
Despite its huge profits, the mining company does not reduce the sulphur mechanized to save costs, and provides those who work on their own account and paid for by weight, no equipment.
They also get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) bid a camera, the guardians of this nature demand money at a rate of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), along with the admission of the tourists who come for the shooting of the volcano and the human-el.

I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and eyes itching, if the wind suddenly turns and the thick columns can become trapped in the mine, rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses, of course, in addition to the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have distorted by the weight of the baskets.

Singapore needs babies to rescue the economy.
The SWF blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the upbringing of children.
"The people of Singapore has to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, You're my patriotic wife: We meet our civic duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but still, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a rapper-songs, who is pushing local slogans such as "a" Bao "(loaf) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising firm BBH, which has shot the video, preserves the hope that the commercial achieved in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to perform their "national duty".
This is something only for the internet, so we had to make it funny and witty.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The breed is the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue we had to take action on.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume flirts with Pheromonen or the organization of speed-dating evenings (fast).
Be that many of these ideas were creative, it led to success but not mandatory.
So we thought: Why do we not be as creative as possible in order to address this problem, for example, to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore is he that this issue is not easy.
Every year, they are $1,300 for policies to encourage people to have more children.
Couples and parents for a package of government grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city state in southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national population authority the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why does the SWF not have more children?
Spouses and family policy for Tan Wei Ming, director of the national population Authority, says that it was the result of a "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled the people, except to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities," she said.
These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single parents and the delay of marriage and birth, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims at a drastic increase in the immigration to counteract the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
There are Web sites in Singapore, where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese be criticised that they keep wages low and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the governing party in Singapore last year reached its worst election since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate of the known effects on economic growth of a nation that has the health costs, tax revenues, and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments will be built.
They also have an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can support the lifestyle of the single, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company selling El Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" is much more quickly than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
The result is that they are much better for our cash flow.
He is, however, the developers, the new standards to be clearer guidelines, which were previously stumbling blocks, if they wanted to build too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if the new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate is the talks with the Singapurern who work in the financial district, to see that they will have no big effect.
"The people are strongly stressed that the education and housing are expensive, so it will be postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me, it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.
Men and women are engaged in their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that they cannot have children.
The SWF therefore have the last word, when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much.

Offline Private is offline private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary is the private property or "the area of private life, where you have a right to protection from any kind of intervention."
What is private for anyone under 16 years?
How is this definition applied to his daily life and the social networks?
He understands the dangers that he exposes himself, if he makes known situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years, which often are on the Net.
In four of the cases linked to the term with "something very private" on a personal level, "the password and user," if you apply it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I would not announce in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of "private" in Web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very sensitive secrets, my mother would know it, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
FB upload pictures of games and I beautiful pictures.
I also distributes me my time with relatives.
"I would share no photo, which is not of me, or of someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked, of crimes or violent or abusive comments to write.
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has in FB and nine Folger on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother, the password has become one of the accounts.
I reported me to express myself and write interesting tweets on Twitter.
"I don't know if someone answers, invite-only," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can easily talk with friends or relatives in the distance," he gives in.
He replied that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger asked.
Even if someone a stranger empfähle, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year Jose is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and ask to ask it to 20 of the people are not knowing that he has attached to a friends list.
"That frightens me not because we have anything in common, it is music," for example.
After giving him no one has asked him after his address or phone number, or only hints of the boy.
"If somebody harassed me or they asked of me," he is simply remove it from my account.
José reported to ask, after he had read a recommendation on Twitter.
The boys are not unknown experience, which is now known as cyber-bullying.
The friend of a friend was blackmailed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim has not closed the account.
"He has made it private."
Then he outlined a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, the boy would upload photos of relatives in embarrassing or awkward situations.
Yes, I would do if he is unsympathetic to me or I get him one, wants.
"But I know that this is cyber-bullying," he said.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with university degrees in education and learning, says that it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform, to guide the children and young people.
"The Internet was established as a medium for the search for information, with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game but," she says.
Porras explained that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in education at Yale University and author of the book "digital natives and immigrants" shaped these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
They are the digital natives, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we learn even more," he says.
He says that this is a complex issue, "because we demand of them that they have a defined criteria about what can be said or spread, published, and that in an age where the maturity of this is not enough."
"They should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be loved to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions, they will bring food for thought.
"to tell you they should not do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras calls after some possibilities: There are things that you would not tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, if you like, if you published a photo of you, like the one that you've released from a friend?
You know, what others publish about you?
If you have photos of celebration labelled the other people asked for permission before?
And one more question: Should all know what you do at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone is outside of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he said.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professors, primary school teachers and educational consultant, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the directives of social networks.
If you understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one account on the Internet.
"For example the age, or what can be published or shared," he explains.
According to the Guardia, children need to be reminded of the "Thou shalt not speak with strangers" lesson.

The conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today without publication of the Declaration of Lima in Peru, which was previously announced, and should, in theory, be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe tried repeatedly to gain access to the document signed at the sixth annual meeting of the leaders of the Unasur. Sources in the state and presidential office told initially that they would pass the exam after it said later, however, that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government for some time.
For questions to the text gave them that the content was outlined by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit meeting was limited at any time.
During the day was limited to the press room but the image of the president meeting with the message "private meeting without sound audio."
The few details that had among the journalists were received by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
The list was the only document, which was distributed during the day, the participating presidents, what caused unease in the hundreds of journalists from national and international media, calling for more information.
The presidency of Peru then sent to the media an e-mail with the "declaration" of the summit, but the statement by Humala was rather than the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru was host of the Third Summit of South America, Arab states (ASPA), and on this occasion was published by the press the so-called statement of Lima, which it had previously announced, neither despite emphatic call.
On the official website of the ASPA, one can convince themselves that the document was released last Tuesday.
The Peruvian authorities on both international meeting stressed that the information systems would be available for the journalists, but to a large extent they limited access to the information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima launched against Santiago, listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow the verdict on the differences, which we are currently present this international court, and run," said Humala along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and remains a country adheres to the international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and submit to the international courts," adds Piñera gave Humala with hands and added pressure in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would be subject to the ICJ, came after Colombia after a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which it held for a serious mistake had filed suit against the agreement of Bogota, in which it agreed to subject themselves to the judgments of this international court.
The president of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, were present at the summit of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which is excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the ousting of its president Fernando Lugo, participated in the meeting not.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state is leaving the final document, in which it said that 16 decisions taken and the plot lines have been set for 31 projects between the South American countries on a total investment of $17 billion.
Among the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that action would be pursued, "to improve cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty in the cities and transnational organized crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America as well as in the case of natural disasters to act jointly and effectively."
With the crisis in Europe must "accept the economic consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphant trains, but is designed to expand our production capacity and our people to a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the spatial links in South America, particularly in rural and border areas... and, therefore, our countries to unite and develop new forms of the economy," said the Peruvian president in a statement read out.
Among these projects were also five Peruvian who are on the horizontal axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which will make for a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
It also took the final document about the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country for its resumption of the Union of South American Nations serves," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations, was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart in Mexico on Saturday by Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua, to treat the maritime dispute after a respectful of the ruling of the ICJ Bogotá in question.
"Probably I will take on Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday) with the president," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also make the agreement with Nicaragua talks with Nicaragua is necessary," he stressed.
"I hope the president Ortega can say that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto,.
As part of the summit also met in the run-up to the defense minister of the block the adoption of the action plan for the year 2013, what the dialogue and consensus should be strengthened in relation to the defense of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members at the UNASUR, even if the latter is currently excluded.
Peru has time on the chairmanship of the regional bloc.

"South America has to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans "during World War II and in other clashes killing" and "today are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which drive the Unasur's member states.
"must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
The president of Ecuador advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who signed the Agreement of San Jose on human rights.
The teach never commit to something, and in return we sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and financed by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, in Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, was granted.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights" would be met.
He added that there have been "justified suspicions at the time that Assange extradited to a third country and its procedures were not followed."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary have demanded of him, put him on its territory during an interrogation subject for an alleged sexual offence, "the Swedish law that would have allowed beyond the Embassy of Ecuador in London via a video conference can be executed."
Correa said that the danger that would affect the health and mental condition of Assange.
"Ever since he is located in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not serious," said the head of state of Ecuador.
It was, however, the risk that he might take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises carried out in the open.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for the month of June, the granting of a free briefs, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of Europe's Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities to find a solution for the captive founder of WikiLeaks, he stressed that there have been talks with London.
We do not act with human rights, we do not address this word for this case, there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, highest Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European bodies," he said.
And "if Britain morning granted the licence, has done so in my opinion."
And, if Mr Assange in Sweden, the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype interrogated, as it allows the Swedish law and was made in other cases, the problem is finished.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that he will not tolerate "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie to deny freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are bad, not the evil and corrupt politicians, journalists who are seeking profits and blackmail," he said.
In this sense he congratulated themselves that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and neither of the bankers or spit and hegemonic bourgeois countries," and took a re-election in advance that he "will deepen the revolution to continue to move in the right direction."
Correa also backed the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body should be "must be firm and held no opportunism and not legally faired coup," because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The president of Ecuador is also the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and in the wake of the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua before told to negotiate with Nicaragua in the maritime border between the two countries, for "absolutely right."
At present, this verdict is not implemented.
It is a problem between South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the quest for a common path.
They have to be dealt with comprehensively, so that you can overcome them and look to the future.
As he confided to a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, and said that "it is right in Latin America, call the international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he was a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, to reach his third mandate in a row, he indicated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of joy and optimism, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that he would retire from political life, to lose the elections in February 2013.
Power has never interested me personally, but in this unjust circumstances as in Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was there, the likely victory guaranteed, so I must live up to that responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last term as president, and then draw me back from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is firm," he said.
Correa was also related to the treatment of health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, he told me that he had visited for a routine, planned treatment, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
"It is in no way a relapse in the health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian leader took today in Lima on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure a sustainable advance, equality and security.

The cause of the deaths due to AIDS is now a belated recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when it confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor tried to "without apparent success."
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to concern itself about his illness and started to find out about it, and that with such commitment that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, it avoided even the director to adopt a clinic of the IMSS, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
Although there are still many people in the hospital who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already caused harm and has exhausted their immune system and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, "means the great success today that the survival of a patient who receives the treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that the information had been supported by a reputable scientific publication in April of this year.
An expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 final results were that AIDS was a death sentence, but that years of survival and the quality of life by the extent of the damage the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that those people would have greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, mean that the above, who at the age of 25 years the diagnosis is HIV-positive, in that sense, "can easily be 75 years old, so long as he is under control," said the expert.
In order to keep this progress right, it must be remembered that today, on average, the life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in the past few years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS to the annual report of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (yes)) reduced, it is nevertheless true that have died since the release of 60 percent of the AIDS patients covered in the national database.
255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year, it is already 187 deaths in Jalisco alone, however, will be assured that there are universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- Why is still dying people in it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drug. The problem is that people come in far advanced condition, because they do not know their infection status, that is in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a compelling statement: "Nine out of 10 patients come to us if you already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, so all persons, where this is necessary, need to be offered screening tests on a massive scale."
This proposal voting experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also for patients like Fabrizio, who made his test carried out at a private laboratory, and that the only reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age, was already in the era of AIDS and even the Kaposi's had Kaposi's Sarcoma (one cancer tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we would like to hear nothing.
"If I have to die, then burst like three times," says one in my case.
The change was good to improvement, I ernähre me do exercises and take the medication.
His parents now know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everybody else.
"I have to take a lot to have an active and responsible unforgettable pastime, I respect the other person and my health," Fabrizio agreed to share their intimate details with Jalisco MILENIO counts, in order to encourage those with his testimony today in the context of the global AIDS Day fear.
They should make the test if they belong to the Risk Group. The sooner they should know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they can learn how to live like all people in a responsible manner.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between the ordinary citizen and health programs, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places, "actually increases the distribution of condoms, before they were made individually, now they give us to packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
New infections for high-risk people include the young people.
"What do you have?" is a question of widespread ridicule of social workers, guidance staff in schools, assured employees in pharmacies and health care, do not want to expose young people, the correspondent.
He suggested to re-orient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only located behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoting promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question, whether condoms should be distributed under his administration.
"sexuality is not enough; it is the best way to bring the condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 1.317 HIV and AIDS).
The state is seen nationally in 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
Be 92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, blood and 2% 6% over the perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are four or five people for every registered case that do not know.

After the appeal court confirmed a ruling of the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of the group's liabilities vitro, which was reached on a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, creates a sinister precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country, the payment has problems.
You could say that the procedure for the survival of the companies that have no validity in the land of the Stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements, the Mexican laws allow.
In practice, the appreciation of the ruling by the judge handed down on June 15 Harlin Hale at Bancarrotas court for the northern district in Texas to the Mexican companies are exposed to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless.
However, the decision of the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico opens the door to call the Supreme Court of the United States because of inconsistencies.
While the judge in the case, indicating that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, says the appeal court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, firstly that the bankruptcy in trade with Mexico is the main proceedings.
The first point would mean that companies with countries from insolvency proceedings cross profile in the international cooperation is not known.
Indeed, to this end, the model law created the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, and the American Law Institute was used as an arbitrator.
Second is the judgment that without the votes after the recognition of liabilities in the liquidation of the companies that had the vitro branches with its parent company, would not have achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debt.
However, that possibility will be recognized by the Mexican laws.
Indeed, vitro not is the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities under the group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de the Mercantiles (Federal Institute for trade Kon courses).

This is not taken into account by the court.

For this reason, the family Gonzalez Sada before the same court odds to make the vote in plenary vote, in other words by all the judges, because only three of them.

Héctor "Hetin Reyes:" Basketball was my life. "
The basket was the way to the basket ball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, sports combined for more than 60 years and has traveled the world as a whole.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the country's passers like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, lower class, the first National League player was 6 years Rexes part of this sport, be it as a player, manager and agent in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My whole life I have set many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the national team BSN, CEO and president of the Association in the 1990s," remembered Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with his loyal wife Isabel, for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates not with this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and they testify.
Bayamón in heart
Those are the most emotional memories of his time as a player at the Vaqueros of the mid-1950s until 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or general manager of the club.
"That was my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as general manager, trainer or Mitgeschäftsführer eight championships.
There were many rewarding years, including five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "says Reyes.
I remember that I was Gene Bartow, who has worked as a trainer and employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m players.
Want him? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow recommended after the free throw specialists Raymond Gausse inhabitant left and was one of our best launchers.
I remember how he had said that if a championship for Bayamon Mincy possible, Gausse would lead to another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, as he stood at the top of the Association in 1988.
At that time, he plans to enjoy his executions and Mincy's in the national team.
I remember when we won against the United States for the first time at the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee would have allowed us to repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best team that you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan Games in Cuba, where the US team offered a fight as they were when they won bronze at the World Cup against us and we won gold.
When the team were playing not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players "Toñito" Colón (Javier) and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and who gave us great joy, those of vorolympischen tournament in 1995 was varies, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
At the level of international tournaments, his numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at that level as Piculín.
And that is without taking into account the different leagues in his career, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Arman Dito Torres.
The boys like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you believe is the best thing that you have achieved in the dressing?
I was part of the team's most successful era from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams in a season.
What will you have to do?
There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes.
For the guys in Ponce, for example, only play on their territory and only in the national play offs meet teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children unnecessarily make many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, referees and officials-table.
I am proud of that.
Now what do you play?
I listen to music, watch videos from YouTube in music of my time, I enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous around the world with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R" in the TV series "Dallas," where he played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the Ölmagnat J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as a new season of "Dallas" in the culture, died Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a press release of the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace of Dallas, where he played the iconic role again, the most liked him," the family said.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him for the celebration of the harvest festival in Dallas.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman when he died at the hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
He made joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, lovely and talented, and I will miss him greatly.
"He was a unique person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor in his liver noted, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years prior to "Dallas," Hagman known as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the broadcaster NBC sitcom "charming Jeannie" on television.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) that will live at home with him.
He was also cast of two comedies that were broadcast only a short time, for B.The Good Life "(NBC, 1971-72) and" Here We Go Again "(ABC, 1973).
Among his film work included roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary colors" well rated by the critics.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the fascinating despicable J.R., made the Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of television network CBS on the Ewing clan and other figures in the environment was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?," should create the expectation for an episode full of emotion, where the figure was killed by Hagmann almost led to an international speculation and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series thus reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it has been seen by an average of 41 million viewers, the second most popular entertainment in the "Dallas" since the end of "mash" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers, transformed.
It was Kristin, the wife of J.R. (interpretations of Mary Crosby) had the bullets.
J.R. had threatened to portray them as prostitutes and impregnating them, if they are not left the city, but also had other reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted Ewing's role as a corrupt, greedy man with a charismatic smile: A devious businessman and untreuer husband, sought to have its alcohol sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) soak iron.
"I know what should be on the tombstone of the culture," said Hagman 1988.
It should read "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business that he has not won.
Victoria Principal, Mitdarstellerin on Friday on the original series, recalled Hagman as a "tremendous personality on and off the screen."
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable for millions suitor in the world and leaves us who have had the good fortune to know him and to love in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were just a few months ago with great success in the television channel TNT broadcast.
The inclusion of five chapters for the second season was over, and a sixth chapter has just been shot, informed the station.
From Warner or TNT, there was no immediate explanation as to how the Hagmann loss would be dealt with in the series.
He was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the son of singer and actress Mary Martin, the classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan" played.
Martin was still a young people as they Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman got.
He tried his luck at the theater in New York in the early 1950s, after he served from 1952 to 1956 in the air forces in England.
There he met the young designer Maj Axel know his son and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he employed his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and absolutely True) tales about My Life".
"I have nothing written that I believed that it could hurt him in some wisdom or hurt someone," said of the Associated Press at the time.
After a liver transplant, he worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help frightened patients and for a liver donation.
"I advise them to give them courage, I meet with them, if their operations to come and thereafter," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some consolation, such as "don't worry, it is the first time a bit uncomfortable, but it will go well."
As he turned against smoking and took part in several campaigns.

The start of the course, who studied the "end of the world."
The students examine every week apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, when religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of "long count backwards" in the Mayan calendar on December 21, from which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the next two months: The destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have described as "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste Semester that has ever occurred," said Charmé this week the students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey.
If someone analyzed what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor of this semester, which ought to be the last in history, "offers courses on the" end of the world.
In the course of Temple gives beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker "media, culture and the end of the world."
The students examine every week apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which offered hypothetical scenarios that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear materials could come into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war break out.
This month analyzed the students studied films with apokalyptischem content and how they compare in comparison with real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is likely to be credible, possible and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, a professor of Latin American history and his colleague Amara Solari, a professor of art history and anthropology beisitzende formed a team to offer a course with the simple title "The End of the World".
"We are not in 2012, so that we can always retain the option to re-organize the course, in the event that the world does not go under," said Restall.
Despite the imminent downfall must study the students create projects and attend graduation exams.
The final examination is conducted on the eve of the apocalypse in Penn State, which is why the students have no other option than to "continue to work through the night, which claims the world comes to an end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more seats," said Restall on its course for students with a high average, which is filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mails from students asked if there are seats available.
For its part, the students say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, religion and sociology from age 64 for a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really only a matter of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student nursing and psychology for Will Wekesa said to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a classroom, where it will be informed," he gave in.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed, rather than just a professor, said, to believe in the final date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayans, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society, which brings back several centuries, as people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"elsewhere people do not think so," he says.
This is essentially the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at the University of La Salle, who teaches this year in the Philippines, responding quickly to the question of whether he would have "a course on the" end of the world.
"The Philippines is not involved at the end of the world," he wrote as a hint to an exception of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days from the last court has been discussed over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people immediately think of a new date," or about philosophy, that the 21st of December is the beginning of a seven-year period, that would be the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they want to go about "the end of the world" celebration.
"Maybe I call a few friends, so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
