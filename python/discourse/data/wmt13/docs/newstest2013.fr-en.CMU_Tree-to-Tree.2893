A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter as a myth, stating that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, Republican lawyers have identified that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions affect negatively the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will in part of the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the organization of the United States federal elections.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making more difficult the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has grown after the November 2010 elections that saw it add new Republican officials in 26 states.
As a result, 180 projects of laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the single year of 2011.
The new election laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce also the periods of advance polls, the right to register as a voter polling day and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with judicial record.
Before the elections of 2006, no U.S. state did voters to present a photo identification card.
The Indiana was the first State to ask such a requirement.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law of the Indiana in 2008.
The republican authorities clamoured to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to require voters to present a photo identification card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens have not of universal ID cards like health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identification cards issued by an agency of the government of their State.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 to lack such identification.
However, it is often more than $100 to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and persons with low incomes.
In effect, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required ID with photo.
Although most.
Students, voters considered voting more for Democrats, candidates are not permitted in a number of States to use their photo identification card issued by their institution.
However, these same States permit fishing or hunting clubs who vote more members of Republicans for using voting cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two in three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not inconsequential.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns have helped to save approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced significantly the rate of 17 per cent registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states to reduce the period of advance voting.
For example, at the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of electors who voted at the advance polls were African Americans, whereas they represented only 13% of state voters.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They accounted for 11 per cent of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted at advance polls.
In return, whites made up 76% of voters accounted for 46% of electors voting at advance polls.
Of course Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly objected to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic Governors.
The General Counsel of the United States intervened to suspend most controversial laws.
They could limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with photo.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
The Democrat criticism decry the partisan nature of laws that have been passed and they see a clear intent to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre demonstrates that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions affect negatively the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will in part of the American democratic system.

Screening for prostate cancer: the test or not?
In effect, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results with false negative or false positive, which cause unnecessary medical interventions.
What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to screening tests.
To test or not?
We have asked the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another study, this one European, found a difference of mortality among patients who have had a screening and those who did not.
This study has also shown, with a follow-up after 12 years, that was between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastasized if it is not detected.
I would recommend the test from the age of 50, or over 40 years of age if it has a parent who has had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer was detected.
It and other aggressive cancers are indolent.
It really understanding the degree of risk to the patient of his cancer, offering potential options, not necessarily prostate cancers that do not to life in the long term, and instead, in such cases, for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who detected the cancer will not be addressed, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
It will suggest to active monitoring and if the disease progresses, it will provide a treatment.
Increasingly, with the precision of the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I would recommend it to the test.
But what's important is to have a discussion with his physician to determine if it should pass or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool that is designed to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent illness.
It is unfortunately not magic recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle remains the best means to reduce risk.
An estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent 30 percent of cancers.
"If nobody smoked, this rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, estimated that about 10 per cent of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several also remains totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
The cigarette is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This greatly affects the health of people.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Data: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying of a cancer halved.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also favor the emergence of the disease, according to the CSC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum, cancer of the oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that the regular practice of a lifetime physical activity protects against colon cancer," he added.
The food
The agency also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, it increased the risk of colorectal cancer.
Low-fat luncheon meats, and should also be avoided.
The conservation of the meat by smoking, curing or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explains it.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research is not conclusive for the time being.
Studies on the vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one found a decreased risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather than an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer is not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed on the importance of talk of its concerns and its family history with her doctor.
'' Skip a screening test, it does not cancer."

The Higgs boson décortiqué
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson has created quite a stir last summer, and with good reason.
thought that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of any thing in the universe, no less.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model -- our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter -- but that has not yet been observed empirically.
But to physicists, it is not yet entirely sure whether the Higgs.
knows without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and that it closely resembles Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a congress of physical, to Kyoto, seem to confirm, but still lack of data to be perfectly clear.
Assume all the same whether the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong appear slim, and see what it is.
There has, in this world, a law necessarily inevitable that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
No way of breaking this rule -- and don't try too hard, you'll hurt you.
Or even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it is that she, too, this kind of legislation: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" -- that "state" of roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, particle physicists are in two categories.
In one corner, there is good citizens appointed fermions, wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And in another wave of bosons, a dirty gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything -- in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually find themselves in the same place, same time.
These bosons then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary,) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: meson, that we will not here, and "particulate matter", by which the spread of the great forces of nature and the Higgs boson would in some way related.
These bosons-là, it must be emphasized here, are not all too exotic creatures than you might think.
In fact, if you read this column, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary ordinariness: the photon, or particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in effect, a particle with an electrical charge, accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbing" the electromagnetic field in this location, a bit like launched a pebble in a pond.
In this "disruption" is an electromagnetic wave (of the light, or infrared or ultraviolet, etc.) and this is nothing other than a photon -- and therefore, a boson "carriers".
Field more stable
It goes well with the Higgs boson, that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" to appear this boson.
The Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for him, is very, very high energies, a little as if it was a frozen pond in which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
It is therefore a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN -- the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km circumference! -- to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the report and the mass of the Higgs.
This is indeed not all particles, or all materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, but others are not -- a piece of paper, for example, will never of himself on a fridge.
Similarly, not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, me) have not.
Now, what that "can make "all this research, ask Senator Plamondon?
For the science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM) and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between observations and predictions of MS.
They are many hoped fervently that, because the slightest bit of difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes of the Model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or the dark matter, which about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oups!).
But such differences to CERN was not found until now.
Impact
The implications of this research in the daily life of the man and woman the average Joe, they are more difficult to predict, but we would assume that there will not.
Hold: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, Bell Laboratories, had no revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing of the rest.
In fact, we had already said the late physicist Willard Boyle -- who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which has developed the first laser continuous (first were pulsed) in 1962 -- initially the laser was seen as a "gadget lab."
Imagine ...
And then, applications also can come from any instrumentation research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, during the course of its work in perspective.
This sensor, though this was not the original intention, is now "eye" to all digital cameras of the world, and won the Nobel physics 2009.
This does of course not to say that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know ...

Palliative Care -- The best way to die ... | Le Devoir
With its Commission to die with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly then prepares a draft bill.
However, in this critical area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir has attempted to look more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in her apartment in the Montérégie region.
The cancer of the prostate that gnawed him a break of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years", he said, mixed, lying in his bed at the hospice Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where it arrived the day before.
"But it is always a shock, it may not be prepared to it," he said.
The disease made her work: a huge weakness which go only to the bathroom, and even eating alone.
Attablé before an appetising breakfast, he agreed to help to eat, resigned.
Brave, even to smile, spoke to strangers who are around him, bring him his medications, offer him a bath.
The courage of regular death.
"My greatest wish is that it cured me of diarrhoea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team has found a solution to this evil.
"Throughout our lives, we learn that a man, it pissed standing", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.
Régresser at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept the regression, he says.
For, in the view of many people working in palliative care, moments take place in the heart of this regression.
Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer all the cancer.
They have a prognosis of maximum life of three months.
At this stage," the team of doctors and nurses that surrounds them provides no more so-called curative care.
For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is of dying "conscious and stifled".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she added.
"I have wishes in life," she says, before accepting that he presents a mask to help her breathe.
It is still, in the next few days, a last visit of her son from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, it provides, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
What is palliative care, given when no nothing else to do.
To make the deaths more comfortable.
In Quebec, a palliative care bed for 11 700 people.
It's very little when that all dead.
Here, life continues in the best conditions possible, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
In dying, it will provide mouth care in brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
People with diabetes will no longer control their blood sugar.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Last night, a beer was served to Mr. X, died during the night.
This morning, it is his son until the beer to the feet of the deceased.
"It helps relatives as well as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At home Victor-Gadbois days follow but are not the same.
alongside an old man of 93 years which enjoyed its last gathering of family in the courtyard, although stalled in its pillows while on rap in his honor, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded of his parents, his wife and their two young children, after any attempted to survive.
"For six months, there still three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel is concerned.
53% of patients who are admitted to the home Victor-Gadbois arrive from their home, 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
said that 77% of Canadians have simply not access to palliative care, i.e. to care designed to ease the pain when a patient is reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a care home.
And several agencies, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and the Society of palliative home care of Greater Montreal, more or less exclusively specialize in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this deficiency in Quebec health care that concern to several palliative care physicians the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto, signed palliative care experts including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, traveling to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone shall be entitled to quality end-of-life care before it agrees to carry out euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient from 14 days to the emergency, in great pain, without that it is necessary to alleviate poverty.
I fear that patients are dying because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists scrambling on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
The survival hopes of Hélène Richard were already minimal when it abandoned a gruelling chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that the treatment, she said that she regretted that I shall fight, she was told.
However, she told me that I was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believed that 90% of patients who request to die thank the caregivers have not acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But many say that palliative care are not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care to the Society of palliative home care of Greater Montreal, the patients would be refractory to treatment against the pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which is to sedate the patient until the time of his death, or sporadically, permanently.
You can not pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily say "I want that you euthanasiiez" it means "I want to be relieved."
The achievement of this report was made possible thanks to a journalism award of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

Scandales real large-scale in Quebec
Officials of the road, construction contractors, political fundraisers and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day in and day out what they know of a great "system", with the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
A "industry" at great cost to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It is curious as the system was being eroded since major step was taken," quips Jacques Duchesneau, MP and former Chief of Police of Montreal in Quebec City.
It is that the scandal has erupted in 2011, by means of a survey on fraud related to contracts of road work in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had made it backwards.
The "Duchesneau report "was a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and the corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, the only department of transport would have saved $1 billion on the contracts", some réfrénant their instincts to share!
The Commission Charbonneau" has already dropped two mayors," he says, in the hope that it reaches to "demonstrate the individuals behind schemes".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, it also with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
More police officers of "the Hammer" squad which, since 2009, had the "cartel of sewer" of Montreal to soft pedal on the puffiness of contracts ...
In recent weeks, she conducted searches in series and brought charges for fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had recently resigned his position of mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
It is suspected of having pocketed repeat bribes in exchange for public contracts.
are formally accused by addition of engineers and entrepreneurs to the road of Montreal of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
This has caused a stir in explaining to the mechanics of the committee of "the system" for public contracts.
He has paid for years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal through a linked to the mafia who reversait money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has cast to the wind in the years 2000, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about € 68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then.
He also acknowledged organizing a collection of illegal funds for the ex-vice-premier liberal, Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts sewer which it inflated costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, ex-ingénieur in public works, the detail before the Commission: in ten years, it has received gifts of construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange of sewage contracts which it inflated costs.
Other officials said the road could grease the leg in inflating invoices from 30% to 40%, by false extras.
Then a Mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay deliberately closed eyes on a parallel budget into its coffers with dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was elected the first Montréal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies district, east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal property purchased $5 million and resold ... 1.6 million to developers in real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
In the survey that will eventually be put in place, it said that it "takes on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and nail the wrongdoers".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
It is in the process of cleaning the wound but he should own investigation unit in Montreal and a watch, not to see return questionable practices.
As they cleaned.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau also that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but concern the role of "aware of the scheme", when they dipped not in deception!
Believing to 70 per cent share of dirty money in the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I was told that this was a pale reflection of the reality."
The Québec government proposes to limit $100 donations to the party but it will not change, he says: "As long as it does not strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a comprehensive review of the system for awarding public contracts and of party funding: "We can not go lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this history is the international image of the Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to watch in their own backyard ...

"The MTP is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken a new dimension with the MTP.
Why that progression?
It may explain by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the MTP.
Major players arrived.
Every day, I progressed to their side.
The technical staff has also contributed a great deal.
On a daily basis, these factors lead me to raise my level of play.
And, in the match, it is easier.
Everything is moving very quickly in football.
But I am not ignite.
In my early days at the center of the INF pre-training Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I always advanced by levels.
You therefore use competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti ...
The recruits this summer are accustomed to compete in games of a very high level.
They also know that every day is crucial.
This is a player like me want to respond and provide the maximum.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my positioning.
It is assisted by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, it has no equal in Ligue 1 and part of the best European coaches.
It was a great experience and has earned many titles with exclusive clubs.
It has worked with great players.
I think they will win the other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a discussion with him.
I then went out of a series of injuries.
The confidence that he has placed in me also says my performance.
How do you on the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon, we took the top spot.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we qualified for the final with the way the 8th.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
It will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But will our word to say against very good European teams.
We first want to finish top of Pool, before Porto, to receive during the 8th of the final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
It already has the budget ...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the period.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the GMP provides the means for this project come to fruition.
In Ligue 1, not to win the title, as last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would represent a big disappointment.
This year, it has really pocket this title of champion.
Last season, it is not far off.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualifications to finish first.
It has made a very big season.
It has finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be the champion ...
But another team, Montpellier, has an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think that it is the right one.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are to the fight for the title, I think that it has the weapons to win.
Do you expect the media too of the MTP?
It is normal that expected a lot of us in the light of what has been invested and players that was.
It accepts completely.
After, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and found still to blame us, it is sure that it is a little frustrating.
It wondered what people expect.
It can never win 4-0 every weekend.
It is not the FC Barcelona!
It is trying to build a project of the game.
A team is built over time.
It has proved that it could meet in the Champions League.
Take Manchester City that does not happen, the last two seasons, to qualify for the 8th of final, they have also made huge expenses!
In light of the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points to the truce.
It was neglect our adversaries and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, have been "turbo-charged" by this new MTP.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we have the smile in telling us that, despite all the difficulties, it eventually won.
The GMP appears totally dependent of the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Both better said that there was a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals.
It is ripe for it and it proves that it is the star of the Ligue 1.
It has shown wherever it is that it was a great player, a global star.
Within the group, Human Rights and the player.
He also meets men he has around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
This prompts the other to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also to the entire world.
How have you lived in Euro 2012 with France?
As a disappointment.
I had to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to game time.
I saw things there and I am out strengthened.
Today, I arrive to make good matches in selection.
That is what I had hoped since my baptism with the Blues.
It has learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and it needs to have an exemplary behavior.
How do you on the first few months of Didier Deschamps, head of the Blues?
The results for him.
It is well placed in the group qualifier for the World.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins.
As Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't do comparison.
Blanc had achieved its goal in us qualifying for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps lead the Blues to Brazil.
The good (1-1) out on 16 October, in Spain he is founding a match?
The game gave us confidence.
Each was beaten for the entire world.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a game in my career.

With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
While the opposite of current monetary exchange, based on identified transactions of central banks, and the costs of treatment among stakeholders.
In addition, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, bank monopolies, led to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (convertible into dollars, euros) and a protocol to the secure exchange of BitTorrent, which enables peer-to-peer file sharing.
About 200,000 transactions have been registered through to 15 000 computers on the network.
A small 1,000 of Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The course of bitcoin, after having reached a peak of $30 (€ 23) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen $( courses are identified on the site bitcoincharts. com).
Nothing of very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a virtual currencies report published in October.
She described bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is other types of virtual currency as "credits", used to make progress in a video game that wins in playing or that we can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority control and trafficking trade.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, money transmitters, and buyers and sellers.
How this network?
Each transaction between two users is really between two e-mail addresses to the way in an e-mail.
Except that a user can select a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a system of double encryption key.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the book of public accounts, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is by the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and won, so interim central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a phase of hash file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in a shorter and unique digital footprint.
The computers are "the new transaction and it added a number before "chop".
The goal is to find the number which gives a particular footprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once found this number, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user would pay twice with the same money very fast (less than 10 minutes, one of the two transactions would be validated by the network -- other orphaned because both have different fingerprint.
The computer resolved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until 100 millionth, which leaves the margin ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also up to each increase in computing power.
The network's life has had ups and downs.
A number of websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the bitcoins in deposits stolen.
"The flaw used not the protocol itself", Pierre Noizat, just launch Paymium, a company of payment in real money using the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also anonymous possibilities of money laundering through this service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Some players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, accept.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins are not moving.
In November, giant balances" have been launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts of bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book teaching on this currency, believed in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or to a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are less expensive.
The holder manages over its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement merchants, who did not need to install new terminals or software.
It is sufficient to provide an address that can "phone photograph and recognize," said Pierre Noizat, which have thousands of users.
There was a general movement of questioning of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for that Bitcoin is necessary, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, is a reassessment of the risks, today considered high, in the case of the success of this currency.

We are the party of Afghanistan.
And after?
The French troops were left in their area of responsibility in Afghanistan, Kapisa and Surobi.
NATO and the Americans should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army takes possession of its territory and that Afghans decide their future, without any wait for us.
This mainly Afghan farmers that we punished them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, injured, maimed.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders in Pakistan, but often of peasants who refuse the foreign military presence, such as the time of the Soviet Union.
They want to defend their old and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by Pakistani jihadists,, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
Tolérés, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will not when Westerners are more discrete.
The departure of French troops from the base of the Kohi, that I have noted the high hills planted almond thanks to French credits, was in the order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles have joined the Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters.
Taliban onslaught on Kabul will not be available as early as the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible breakthrough from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country and the struggle between different factions.
Their control of the country had been seen as a kind of release, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of the farmers, overwhelmed by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They became in business class, seizing government land for resale in the land of returnees from Iran and Pakistan, with "huge U.S. contracts of subcontracting.
They are fisherman; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to quit, as will those who take advantage of American largesse: capital flight is huge.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They have worked with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now of 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls as boys.
It will provide labor to these young people who will not return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; the television, and its Turkish soap operas that have a modern world, was followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
The authorities ordered which will be considered as legitimate?
Some former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight are already rebuilding provincial militia, which escape to the central power.
Afghanistan, country of mountains, to strong local identities, should enjoy some decentralization, to the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted the transformer in a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister which existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai is not foreign controls, especially during elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country is, since the 1950s and before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has not been filed, no dam is in the state, no major system of irrigation is not repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This has only added to the sense that Westerners n" were there to capture it.
Without energy to process copper or iron ore on the spot, or means of transport for export through the mountains, no mining.
The Chinese have already left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) search the vast Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
It will eventually also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely depend on imports and exports, restore normal relationship.
The departure of French troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school girls, boys, the French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
since 2009, to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive action, a service "civil-military" actions of the Department of Defense (Cimic) deleted in 2012, has carried out, and carried out by a small French NGOs, many agricultural work and rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, gourmands in main-d ' local, could help to contain the insurgency: irrigation, sinks, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase cultivable areas.
What will we as a memento, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget contribute to improving local living conditions, very tough in these valleys located often to more than 2 000 metres of altitude.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests of small agricultural achievements from local communities of the province of Kapisa.
For that they release the insurgency carried out by foreign groups, what the farmers told me, it should maintain in their favor a small civilian aid, well controlled and that directly affects them.

A Constitution forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, it has decided to play his va-tout.
Taking the whole world of court, he announced on Wednesday, that the Constituent Assembly vote its final text the following day.
just a week ago, the Head of State had granted an extra two months to this Assembly to conclude its work.
That almost two years that Egypt is based on a provisional text, amended a number of times that renders the institutional stability and lead to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For its opponents, the autocratic President perseveres in its "delirium," continuing "betray his word" and of "trampling the law".
side of its supporters, is that it is a means to end as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the process of transition.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forcing the Brotherhood to give up their project to explain the text article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find a popular legitimacy and democratic while the dispute raged throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for it, as he stated in an interview to the weekly U.S. Time.
In that appeal to a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, I take full powers", they allegedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, to the Islamist majority, have voted the text yesterday.
The most liberals were missing.
Come mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, do not have to give their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or of civil society in had done the same.
In order that the quorum is reached, 11 persons of alternate members, have been added to the rush, yesterday morning.
Some are very close of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Commentators have also enjoyed the fact that one of the only differences of the day is around ... the hour of prayer, some members of the Committee on the grounds that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was improperly.
The text, which was still being "d" to be voted on yesterday evening, 234 articles.
Objects of all attentions, identical to that of the Constitution Article 2 remains at the end of 1971, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "principles" by "rules", which would permit a more strict application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of their goodwill and their respect of other components of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," are liberals, who see that a communication.
For the Islamization of the Constitution, according to them, is through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives an advisory role to Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to check the conformity of laws with the sharia.
According to the specialist Sophie Pommier, Egypt is worrying because "people called a decision are not elected and not have any democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy."
The liberals ' fears were further fuelled by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, it remains in the framework of the civil state.
Most jurists who have worked on this text are not the scholars but academics, some trained in the French system" moderates Alexis Blouet, preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be an ambiguity around section 220, as religious terms from vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence, ed).
And the issue could arise in the future of the extent of civilian judges are competent to decide upon."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is very critical because of expanded powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood assert that they are significantly reduced in comparison of what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point: powers to the army.
Pursuant to the desire of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a Council of National Defense.
No more that are not prohibited the trial of civilians in military courts, the human rights defense associations.
These are also part of their concerns about the text, that they consider freedom.
The crime of blasphemy and insult is maintained is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, of the press in particular.
In addition, any article is no longer echo to the protection of women, said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President should speak yesterday evening to the TV, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State marching them, on Saturday.

"Who has language, Moscow will": migrants save money to learn the language
While human rights activists and MPs polémiquent on this that will give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling "counterfeit" certificates have already appeared in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers from St. Petersburg to Moscow and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, what are the nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their sole purpose: to earn money to support their families at home.
Since a law came into force on 1 December, and stipulates that every migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian.
For the moment, this Rule only those who intend to work in the services sector, housing, personal services and retail.
However, with time, promises the federal migration service, tests become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and of legal bases.
It will need to validate their knowledge of languages in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
It exempts only the nationals of countries where the Russian has the status of official language.
Persons with diplomas or degrees of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not concerned by this Act.
Net, negative attitudes and protection of human rights
The network of examination centres under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language of Pushkin, the University of the friendship of peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions.
Immigrants can take examinations in cities across the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews has been supported by Deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Service of Migration.
But, before the Act comes into force, human rights defenders have repeatedly raised the issue in the press: that is that it will give?
What is the obligation of the Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants?
First of all, to meet representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people with "slave labor".
A lot of defense of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service of Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of organized selection will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not speak the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev migrant, the future is designed to cross dishonest people who, under pretext of the assist, to provide a "trip" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of its similar to agonise for months without food and without paper and will have between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints on the part of our migrants.
"At them, promised them a thing, and when they arrive, are wrong, we took their passports, and they do not affect the planned salary," confirms the head of the Directorate of migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Let me not argue, the police!
However, many citizens of the republics of Central Asia that want to come to make money in Russia entrust that they not only know the language of the country where they wish to visit, but also they write with difficulty in their own language.
This is obviously not their fault, but their misfortune: little Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow if only a primary education fair.
Indeed, their families have not even feed their children without talking to dress them properly and equip them for the school.
Once they reach adolescence, these young people are earning money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It is difficult when you do not know the language, do.
"You feel diminished and undermined."
Defenders of Human Rights noted, however, an important aspect of the law relating to the language.
The reviews will be used only to migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, no formal review or work.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or enter "defense
Many immigrants to explain that it is not so easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles roubles.
And then, we can get a false registration quickly for only 1 500 roubles.
The Russian police know that we have forged documents, that we do not have registration, where cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 roubles, which buy their own cigarettes, tea," said to journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, citizen of Tajikistan.
"quickly, do and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the law relating to the language, the paper found that the registration of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language examinations have been confiscated by the employees of the federal migration service.
The falsified papers from a regular color printer.
Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: every immigrant who was to facilitate the task of reviews had cost seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two-and-a-half times more expensive than the formal procedure: it will cost to migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of power and the Defenders of Human Rights agree to say that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption for that it is impossible simply to buy these pieces of paper".
The authorities can give to migrant workers who could not validate the time of the review of the first to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who are unaware the Russian will the proposed work in areas that actively involve not communicate with people.

The Ministry of the Interior is not the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against carrying weapons.
This is the authorities ' reaction to recent incidents: whether fire performed at weddings or the killings organized by the Moscow lawyer, Dmitry Vinogradov, who has made seven deaths.
The police to ban the wearing of arms to rubber bullets in public places and raising the legal age for obtaining the licence from 18 to 21 years.
The idea has been supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the Act on the weapons would be introduced to the State Duma in the near future.
While the world is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities trying to resolve the problem in "tightening the screws."
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various centres of fire, require to abandon "foolish" hardening.
The percentage of crimes committed with a firearm registered is minimal," said the Russian Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and specialist crime for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes have been committed with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 1,000 crimes were recorded on the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civilian weapons laws prevent criminals do not supply the black market.
According to them, can be found today in Moscow any type of weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: of the plant to the officer
The black market weapons is provided via several channels.
The main canals are five in number, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served 10 years in the Ministry of Education and at Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking orders weapons
The first is "military evidence", i.e. the weapons that have been stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," said Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market were stolen by criminals to the forces of order.
Baranets explains that it is both stolen in the stocks of the police that those stolen directly to representatives of the forces of order.
The illegal guns are in sales since the military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"certified versions indicate that some fires were triggered intentionally to conceal the deficit," says the former military.
For Baranets, arms manufacturers are there for something.
"It sees private weapons plants compete not only with the competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow," an expert says.
One of the other sources of black market is the smuggling.
A significant share of pistols and machine guns from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"It sometimes small-scale local production, a mafia and organizes the supply," added the former military.
Where are the weapons?
The experts have assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue has been established in 2011 analysis of problems and study by the Centre for Public Administration.
Specialists have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and portals of public data relating to weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, from the army and security forces.
Half of these weapons on the black market if it is found by lack of employees whose work is linked to weapons", it was suggested in the report.
According to the researchers, 17 per cent from 14 per cent of places of military conflicts, are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "clandestine excavations."
A salesperson and consultant of a gun who requested anonymity ensures that long since anyone can buy weapons found by these specialists of the illegal search; they are too old.
The more often, according to him, sellers will seek new military goods in warehouses.
The person buys a unit through a sign, for example a TT pistol.
On the book from the goods by a screen.
"It moves in the city and sells for € 900 per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police is aware of all the cases, as well as, when crimes are on the point to be clarified, it makes a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers," says the seller.
"Like in a boutique luxury"
The vendor and purchaser are generally by means of knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a type appears and offers me come to the station of Begovaya where someone became take me in a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, it gave me on the spot
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, is that I know of someone who has a contact," says the seller. I know someone, but I do not trust.
There was vendors on the markets, but there must also come in saying, for example, "On behalf of this person, who asked me to convey his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even bought a pair of American fists to the aid of a person to whom I trust.
I only book to me because he knows that I will not.
The new kids seek weapons of different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets was tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, in his view, have not changed.
It gave him a photo album in which there was "everything you want."
"I thought in a boutique of luxury," remembers the military.
No secret for the buyer, said Baranets, you can try anything.
As a potential customer, I am not a buy, with the seller in the forest and was a target.
"It leaves me and when I am satisfied that the weapon is working well, it begins to negotiate", describes the expert.
A shop since his couch
The search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons" for different uses."
For this, we need no documents and person.
"Just to have a specific sum of money," they wrote in advertising on the site "Buy a pistol or a submachine gun battle."
The users leave their application and pose their questions.
And it sells to minors?
"Without a permit, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"Buy TT. Moscow," wrote "Fedorenkov "in its very direct request.
The Federal Security Service released a huge network of fake sites and to pick up the shovel people willing to buy the combat arms.
People rush on the food such as wolves hungry and then they are to exploit coal in Siberia
Viktor Baranets, observer and former military
I have heard of this type of schemes: usually, the site is outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the kiosk.
"It receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon was concealed," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets argues that by making a request on the site, we may find themselves without a weapon and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service released a huge network of fake sites and to pick up the shovel people willing to buy the combat arms.
"People rushing food such as wolves hungry and then they are to exploit coal in Siberia," -- he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts agree, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Mrs. Right of association" a weapon", can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 $.
It will wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long warehouses by the direction of these warehouses of average size.
According to the Department's official data, compared to the period of October 2011, the number of such crimes has generally decreased 7% in Russia and rises to 22.9 miles while proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs fell 7.8 per cent.

United States: employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers spend by a cashier at McDonald 's
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, one can not predict whether this wave will grow or fade quickly.
These actions are supported by a number of associations and unions of the left.
At the same time modest wage increases that wage earners in Walmart basis and fast food chains, events organisers wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not yet covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a rain pounding of seizing balances of millions of people descended on the America and sometimes of outbursts.
On that day, some employees of the company Wal-Mart, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, have left their post to picket with trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers of small and medium-sized classes.
Walmart sells everything: diapers to hunting rifles from car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8 per cent to 27 per cent cheaper than the major supermarkets.
That is why many of low-paid employees at Walmart shop solely on their place of work.
The prices and product choices have made one of the most powerful groups of Walmart U.S..
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap, inter alia because of low wages of its employees.
They also complain of difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
The participants of the events of "Black Friday" for salary increases, they complained of the fact that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 $per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart that receives $9.5 of the hour, it is a sum that it can not afford.
Scientists of the University of California Berkeley demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average salary of $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% of more of what it spends.
If Walmart transferred all of the increase of salaries on the shoulders of consumers, would each race in the store to 46 cents.
They spend $12.39 in only one year of more than now.
Supporters of Walmart noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and have not brought any harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" has continued in the evening from 8 am to midnight the following day and Walmart stores sold 5,000 articles on this period to the second.
Its funds have made 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
The spokesperson Dan Fogleman has left site in an interview with the Huffington Post that "fewer than five employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a "communication among many" by the union organizer.
"Customer following!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not more progressive Walmart stores in this city, they are not very popular, it is why they are not yet implemented) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces sell billion servings and after they are not even sick leave and pay you not the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by the federal legislation and that of New York is $7.25 per hour.
The fast increase with time, but of little, average its employees basic affect New York $8.90 per hour.
There is no less than in this city.
For me it is not possible to live with that amount to New York.
It was a time where almost a quarter of American teenagers working at McDonald's after the school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for long.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain of having to live with that salary and sometimes to feed their children with.
On the other hand, Wall Street Journal found comments on the forum of newspaper saying that it is irresponsible to children if you don't know with what you feed them.
The demonstrators that have launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 on McDonald's near the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, required that cashiers and the fast-food cooks are paid at least $15 per hour, or an increase of more than two times that the current minimum wage.
They also sought to ensure that the establishment of trade unions in the sector of fast food.
The U.S. law prohibits impeding administration and punish a union protesters by bullying or redundancies.
However, the administration rarely simplifies life.
For a union, grab fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
The major one is the special staff rotation.
They are not agree
Other tumultuous events took place near several other fast-food chains.
The highlight of the protest has been the rally in the middle of the day near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, City Council member, who said: "McDonald's announces sell billion servings and after they are not even sick leave and do not pay the work you've done honestly!".
The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats, including by the candidate to the position of Mayor Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we must all support the employees in fast food to obtain a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorker.
The New York Times has characterized the event as the more important that the fast food sector in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people attended from all were not employees of fast food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently difficult to say if this will spark a mass movement.

"For the moment, that moderate to fool the brain"
Lately, fans of the new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it is that Google unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it has learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, the interview with the group's director of interactive 3D technology from the laboratory Microsoft Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, and scientists of this society, the glasses are already history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, by the creation of open spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words that made your group of research?
- We are working on the interaction between human and machine and we at the same time expand the borders of this interaction.
The humanity as a whole remained flat for the time being to pixels on screen and sometimes in touch.
We want to see 5 to 10 years before we guess the radical changes that occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors represent a step forward, and almost no Xbox Kinect without today doesn't sell because everybody looks to the order by the gesture.
- What future?
- Although the Kinect has rendered the physical interaction, a lot of things are on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of the information has been improved (the system receives more data) but the performance, for the moment, not really.
We try to change that and we are working on real 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including technology projection.
It must get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, the more tactile.
For this, however, it must not only identify the user, but also the surrounding it.
Thus, we can complement the real world by virtual objects in a form more convenient.
And to begin with, we get rid of those silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice commands?
It is appreciated, but is not overestimated?
It can not say that this is a panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because you didn't always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.
For example, for ordering the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought to action, not broad gestures, but rather to discrete, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a bracelet worn to the hand which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the joint control, for example: gesture + votes.
That is to say?
- For example, how would you me this can get you?
You do with speech and actions.
- Usually, I spoke only.
- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.
-- So, you want to force users to adapt in terms of what the machine can or can not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I believe that very soon we will need to work to the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These may include, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- Looking to your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, it is that you do not like in the modern cameras?
They lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the 3D recognition.
It would of course obtain approximately 8 megapixels with a speed of 1,000 c/s.
But the problem is not the cameras themselves, but the quality and the depth of the matrix.
Compared to the last point, all current technologies are good enough, it adds of the designers work algorithms.
It must keep to the spirit of the resolution by X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed is important, also, the number of executives at the second.
The human movements are aggressive enough, and 30 (c/s not enough really, especially for actions.
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory of Redmond has given to the touch sensors a delay scheduled of treatment between 1 and 100 µs, current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not influence how the interaction of human and machine.
I need a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touching, to have more executives to the second.
But should not increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the signal.
And the third camera is in fact a usual sensor of the field visible.
It is not to define the depth of the subject.
Many cameras could solve this problem ...
Or worse by increasing the volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the curve of cameras and to see how it could help to define the locations.
- As far as I recall, Microsoft, Google, has not submitted his glasses in public.
Do you not think that a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technology, sunglasses are one of the platforms with the most promising?
- Of course, walk around all the time with a smartphone hands is not practical but what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transitional" that you would from a cloud computing platform to smartphone glasses.
The glasses are a very personal and it is that their (personal elements are those that you're the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality glasses will not work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortal.
There is an issue on which the opponents to this point the finger: no tactile sensation!
The hands do nothing!
What answers your group prepare compared to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the time being, the interesting techniques is the use of second hand for support of image.
It captures perfectly the pressure!
But there also technologies which are actually intended to award the palpabilité to these images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound led to a point where the finger and that gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, a breath of air on the tips of fingers.
There also bracelets worn on wrists which affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also introducing a line of work.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Him to believe that it feels that it should normally feel when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we have not tried yet.
There was still a task là-dessous on which it will come to the wrong: how to suggest to someone who is physically located in a very limited space that he is walking in an open space almost infinite -- we are working on concepts of treadmill (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs) mobile platforms and also of giant balls.
For the moment, that moderate to fool the brain, it is still many years of work.
This makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still to the absolute rule of fertilization.

The reign of taste and not of culture -- Rosbalt. ru
"Rosbalt" continued the project "The avant-garde pétersbourgeoise" dedicated to urban dwellers are in advance, at the forefront of the culture and the arts.
This list ultra-sélective has already hosted prominent players of the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements beyond the border of the city and were a recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new heroes of "Rosbalt" is the painter extraverti Kirill Miller.
Any Kirill Miller knows the city, rather than bearded man, dressed all in red that can cross the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or at parties and openings connected.
The tables of Kirill Miller still bring crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.
It is a fundamentally social and philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, one of the founding of new myths.
Kirill Miller is a distinguished representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes people smile and good humor.
It has recently taken an organ grinder in his hands and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since it was ripe for this difficult role by virtue of its existence, its philosophy and its bohemian image.
- Kirill, why is it that you run the city while red and not in yellow or blue turquoise for example?
- I have chosen the red as designer specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even if everything in the society, which is not gray is negative aggressiveness and agitation.
But my provocations are intended to initiate discussion.
The story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
-- And when you understand that you'd be a painter?
- At the exposure of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where my work.
I understood that it was my way.
So, the wave of unofficial old painters had passed and the new, free, like me, were misunderstood.
I started to friends with painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there has been more vague.
I am interested in theater, fashion, music, all except to words.
- And all that is found in your artistic Clinic ... -- It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of Saint Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I have taken place to Pouchkinskaya-10 home before work, a musical and artistic club, a club bohemian, the home of the bohemian pétersbourgeoise.
Many are born: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Van Gogh's ear".
Chnour and his friends sang songs easy for playback in tight shirts, they included Igor Vdovin, composer today.
When the group began to occur in live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg animait quite emissions before the era of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it is then that his career began, but its basic training and education, it is here that he has received.
Galérie" D137", Club" Griboïedov": what are the implications of the artistic Clinic.
Our employees are parties as regulars.
I am a hero of the past century, where the culture of the time meant something.
In 2000, a survey has been conducted in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city".
I have been appointed "Painter of the Year", and it is then that my reign has ended.
This is not convenient to work in a new era with the old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and the culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of are different things, there may be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognisable style.
Many of my paintings are hits, they have a current and a very high acuity.
I'll have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian museum through clowns".
The clowns belong to a category of timeless.
Before I was someone of Social, today it hurts and scary to be so.
But with clowns, fades, the tragic fall.
I like the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the total disguise and mandatory.
Today, it is the habit that is important, the external mechanism, but not to the inside of the person.
Perhaps we can not give the hand, but that it should rather him spitting in the face.
And the lie will be wiped out by the disguise.
- Recently we you saw in the player's role of organ grinder. -- A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else that I can play.
-- But perhaps the commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be cared for, delicate, sweet wines.
A breakdown of the culture is happening.
Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of the bohemian liked something, the corny one another.
Today, everything is divided in micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a $100 ticket for all things to all people.
Today, it seems to you please.
Each star has 100 fans.
But several thousands of people come and see Stas Mikhaïlov!
- These are persons that was thrown from the see, it is the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, all dying.
I have my fans, the principal is not deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I was clear that a collector has hung beside Falk tables or Larionov.
I started with tables that are normally those painted in end of life.
Today, it often confuses ideas.
It said: there was the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
The consumption has not culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who were living in poverty and died in poverty and that the money for the painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill is lacking in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There was this concept: the staff member of the culture.
But all may not work in the culture.
Under the reign of good czars, this was not like this, the czars understanding the culture, but they need to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there was now good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg that may be experts, but they are discarded, as it requires higher experts who evaluate properly these experts and their pave a path.
Currently, it is the "reign of taste" which blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense they say honestly that they do not all contemporary art, there are some painters who must find other museums.
- For you, that is that it is St Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is the cultural capital, it has to Moscow more culture, there is a ground for it.
And the art on our stones, struggling to grow.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it is bad.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious that will see exhibitions, concerts.
For us, this layer is very thin.
We must make the art to fashion as was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project completed with the support of the award of St. Petersburg

Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or deadly collision with an asteroid.
caravans of space shuttles with land to go to the search for a planet of relief.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to live our species in weightlessness or on a planet of relief?
I believe that it is not much choice.
There was in fact true two planets that can conquer, even hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Astronomical Institute of State P. K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If the conditions are more suitable for life on Mars, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
It can not live at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus ... in outer space.
It has begun to look to the reproductive issues in the area focusing on flora.
half a century ago, experiments were carried out on the plants.
Four generations of peas grown on orbit were not in any way of earth varieties.
Secondly, it has put into orbit of breeding insects, small flies, fruit flies.
In 1979, quail eggs have been sent in the space to see how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
The exit a chick quite normal.
It is then that the problems begin.
"The problem is linked to the fact that the chick must find a support, it must get on its feet and start to move," says the Director of the Laboratory of the Institute of the medico-biological problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev.
In finding no support, chicks is waved in a disorderly way.
And after 10 p.m., new born saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks responded nor to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they simply die after few days.
"We have them écarquillé eyes twice, and then we have given up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev in the failed experiment with chicks in the space.
The last "biological miniature ark with animals has been sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite Bion" will not species of the same sex.
There has been an experience with rats sent with their fetus in outer space.
In principle, found nothing supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites and then it is the only experience. It should carry out this kind of research," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats have given birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, it still fails to make reproductions directly in space.
This is not an easy task.
In losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to make their instinct.
Unlike animals, human is able, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create adequate emotional substance.
This kind of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women are in space since 50 years ago.
The biggest risk has been taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what humanity has the most precious.
Our gull soared and person on Earth could not say if it would after a flight in outer space.
If she could give birth to a child after the flight.
"Nobody responded to this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé retired, rockets and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after its flight in outer space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Mykolaiv was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and have even worked in community walk, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We few, very little of cosmonauts who have nothing and who give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union and Russia, Valeriy Poliakov heroes.
Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Laboratory hydrology of cosmonaut preparation center: the compulsory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in neutral buoyancy, cosmonauts train exit walks.
The water mimics the weightlessness.
If the water is comfortable for adults, but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm: the life on Earth from the ocean.
As long as the baby is approximately 9 months in the fluid of the belly of its mother, it is easier to get into the water.
It is, in principle, logical, because his first bath since its birth, it is only 2 weeks.
"It is very unlikely to forget," says the instructor of swimming for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, whether for the child just born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman of gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the stomach muscles, atrophy very quickly, the baby of surge capacity is lost.
Well, don't know it based on birth simulators.
It may of course prepare a confinement in a special room, the woman will get.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov invited to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also need an artificial gravity.
If it is not the attraction of the land, the agency does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
On an infant can not dress up as an adult with a special combination for training.
It will simply be deprived of its basic needs.
"And this experience that we would in this case in imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will return to Earth on a disabled child, fully désadapté", provides the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of the medico-biological problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in the area is still of the theory.
However, with the time it will become a reality, when Earth will in their shuttle to a distant planet that becomes the habitat of their offspring born in outer space.

The head of the ISC (Institution of Public Finance Control) stated: "the control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech" system Švarc") failed to the politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has inspectors and high-quality legislation but it is lagging behind with regard to its implementation.
It is this that said Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Institution of control of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně. cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what is lacking here," said Kala in its commentary of the current situation.
A control carried out jointly by the Czech and German inspectors also suggested similar conclusions.
It cites as an example of abuse, the approach of "system Švarc" by Petr Nečas.
Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls; is it therefore possible or not?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, then if it prohibits something even the head of government can not prevent action a responsible authority to inspect require compliance with the law," said Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee to the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a project tchéco-allemand which were compared with legislation in the field of public procurement of these two countries.
What was it about?
It is a parallel control that we have launched this about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation to manage how public markets and specific national laws as well as subsequent actual practice.
We have all this and that this process is not yet complete, very interesting differences emerged: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "stronger and better", however, that some parameters, the practice as such is best in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote themselves to the implementation of the law.
What this project can help you and that is it for you?
A common control of this type would contribute to this that we seek to clarify the laws, and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest) in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But lowering the thresholds of contracts, it will not necessarily this objective.
It may that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those seeking loopholes will much more opportunities that if the threshold had remained above.
You talk of internal problems regarding the implementation in practice of the public procurement legislation.
How the control system in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
In respect of institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it has also a council set up a little differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally similar.
The skills are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a shade, however, compared to our system: Germany with a federal structure, it has therefore also of accounts of this kind at the level of the Länder.
The Bank can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the State.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, there are controlled at the level of the Länder courts of audit.
As regards national legislation, she is more simple than ours?
I would not do an overall comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model but it can certainly not say it better in all areas.
This may be due to the fact that they have the best inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I have not the comparison of data.
However, it should also say that this country that we as a model is also facing a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no?
As regards national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are already being felt?
This amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has yet to impact on our screening operations.
As we need controls ex post, starting with a certain delay.
Our observations apply only, for the time being, the process of preparation of future controls -- we have launched a new instrument detection of mismanagement risks" with which we have scrutinised past nearly 14 000 public procurement -- where these changes will, of course, because the thresholds have been modified and that the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so forth.
Is that you consider the adoption of this law rather than as an asset or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulatory regime, the claimant (for example the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) to control subjects to accept that any violation of the law on markets means a breach to the budgetary discipline.
Is it really appropriate to make the law more severe this way?
No, not this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those committing formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put pressure on the administration.
What is the solution to get by?
Look where we are.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with the so-called system controls Švarc -- what would that mean?
The system Švarc is prohibited or permitted?
The law must be applied in one way or another, then if it prohibits something even the head of government can not prevent action a responsible authority to inspect and require compliance with the law.
It may declare: "We will change the law and allow", but he can not say that we will act as if nothing had happened.
The law on procurement has relatively strict rules on formalities to be complied with and that, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only due to formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be fair and it is, in my view, what is lacking here.

The roads are places frozen, but most remain feasible.
In some areas of the Czech Republic, and also snowy roads are frozen.
The network, however, in most practical, in some areas with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the region of Karlovy Vary, roads were passable this morning, but in some places frozen and snow-covered.
The dropped temperatures and oscillate between -10 ° C and -5 ° but slightly back in the day.
The falls of snow have ceased in the region and it is still not in the plains that a thin layer of snow.
The peaks of metal-bearing Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, with about 30 centimetres of snow.
The data of regional service road maintenance that in some places because of fog, visibility was reduced.
The fast track R6 and national roads are now passable without difficulties.
The vigilance remains, however, for example on some bridges which the coating can be frozen and slippery.
All roads and pathways of the third category, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
It remains on some of their segments by remnants of frozen snow and compacted sites by the traffic.
Especially in areas located in altitude, drivers must heighten their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Directorate of roads and motorways said on its Web site that certain roads of the East Bohemian region are threatened by the formation of layers of compacted snow and ice by trafficking may be found on the roads in mountainous areas and higher elevations.
The road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of ice build-up in the areas of Pardubice region located in altitude.
may of ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and this, mainly on the roads and the third category.
The roads I// 34 around Svitavy 43 and I have been treated chemically.
The snow is primarily in the Giant Mountains (Kokonoše) and Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by the traffic is present on roads in upland areas.
In the East Bohemian region, the weather will be dry today, most often identified, with a potential cloudy.
It will blow a wind and temperatures oscilleront generally between -3 ° + 1 ° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads of the Pilsen region are passable today, although, in some places, it should demonstrate increased vigilance and adjust to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures range between -3 ° and 9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and cooling that followed, some channels of communication may be by frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, visibility will improve, however gradually.
It is this that information of regional service road maintenance.
The motorway is practicable road communications maintenance services almost without difficulties, however, recommends increased vigilance among 80 kilometres and 131.
The surface of most of national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental channels and third category are moist and in this case the warning applies against frozen sections.
The drivers must be vigilant, and especially on less-travelled roads of the region of the Šumava.
Olomouc Region
Drivers traveling in areas of the Olomouc region located in altitude must now reckon with a layer of thick and soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the collar said "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
The falls of snow have forced this night road maintenance staff to go on the ground; depending on the services in charge of the road, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are passable without difficulties.
"On the Heights district of Šumperk are remnants of snow.
The drivers moving in the direction of the Jeseník must expect to meet Col said "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick layer of snow and soft" said today the Chief to ÈTK road maintenance services of Šumperk district.
Their colleagues of the Jeseník districts are also on site during the night, after the chemical treatment carried out, roads are now open and wet, even in the higher.
In the district of Olomouc roads are passable without difficulties, in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, be careful in sections in forest areas to pavements remained wet.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, road maintenance services from Northern Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
The data of the police, that in some areas of snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
temperatures remain below zero in lower elevations, and therefore the snow and ice storms are expected to be maintained. In the lowlands, particularly in the south is Plateau Central Bohemia, there, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No difficulty of movement were reported for the time being.
The road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.

also, since the main roads, national difficult conditions on the road 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to the branches of trees that are bent under the weight of the snow to reach the pavement.

Šimon Ornest said: "In partnership, we want the collection of positive energy."
What do you think the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
Only one of these alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love.
The Tap Tap In our group, we laugh and say that we are the only group capable of collecting a remains positive energy to postpone or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you get a unique project: three concerts in December against the end of the world.
Can you make this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charitable work that we have two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for 11 to 21 December 10 hours of the morning.
The previous day, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They come almost to the point where the Maya calendar will end on the island of Kiribati is located in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours in advance by us.
Who was this idea?
Initially I think that it was my idea, then we have designed with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Outside of the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also set, with the public, to reflect the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have created a unique collection of objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and the original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at e-tap. cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world that "reversed" the end of the world (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, it will also at these concerts charitable?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we are successful and that is not the end of the world ...
It will be performed simultaneously by all the interpreters in three concerts.
The anthems will also at some point in the context of a live program, very unique, Czech Television.
The lyrics of the song had been written by Tomáš Hanák also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings ...
How do you have to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities show-biz Czech, in view of the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charity events ...
We strive to participate intensively to these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it is fun.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the training center Studeo which is accessible to persons with reduced mobility and which we are working to achieve in the framework of the institute Jedlička Tap, and that since six years, with the association.
Teachers regularly with students of the Institute Jedličkův and offer activities that interest them and enjoy them.
The students themselves do not have the means to visit of course, we try to help in this way.
In the framework of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedlička will this project in a new independent building.
Several musical groups and performers climb on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a program that speaks to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, will stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all details on www. kpks. cz.
Prepare also to other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will for the first time in the framework of the Prague spring; here too, we will surely a program of quality with interesting guests.
We also play next year in the house of the Czech Republic to New York and personally, to the United States, I want to mix concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimal, so far you played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group composed of persons with disabilities.
How do you carry the organization and logistics of your touring?
This is not so terrible that it has the air at first.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, which gear must travel in the hold, naturally we trimbalons also a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments ....
So far everything is more or less well past, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ with respect to accessibility for persons with reduced mobility, to the attitude of the public opinion of persons with disabilities and so on.
What were your experiences until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we have just witnessed to Moscow that is all that is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet aware that only a person travels in the electric chair in the center of the city.
not yet seen as a clear priority to a person in a wheelchair in a lift.
Fortunately, there also, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
What must we catch up more developed countries?
There was a lot of things for which we are still behind ...
It is important to mention that the improvements and improvements are always the efforts deployed by the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a severe disability travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, at the museum, anywhere ...
This is not very frequent there that a large number of persons with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, are you, The Tap Tap, rather the contrary to the cutting edge!
The respect for the public and access are one thing, but the situation will start to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, famous politicians or lawyers.
For the moment, this is not that isolated cases of persons who have a strong will.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, back in the rear of a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to create this group?
I started to work as an educator at the institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am myself a musician (I played, among other things, the saxophone) -- with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator said Láďa Angelovič, was a bit lost control of the situation (laughs).
The success came during these last years, if I am not mistaken?
That is true, the fact of creating links with known singers and work actively to the promotion of the group helped us.
We have understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as though they do not exist in the background.
Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can, in addition, we have the quality of teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential for change.
The show business is full of tips that copy each other.
In a way, it is logical: all that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who we see for the first time the pity is, of course, this is natural ...
But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with a disability are not ill persons, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
What are people who can live a full life and to flourish, as a condition to have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities are to achieve something, this is not only a step forward for them but for the whole of society.
Is that your success is also due to the fact that you are a leader, as you are qualified by a lot of people?
If we want to do good work, we must be intransigent in many areas and discipline.
But I think that it is quite normal.
Some people come here with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to rehearsals two times per week, follow the preparatory courses and spend much time on the road for a concert, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve objectives.
The group The Tap Tap currently twenty members.
How many of these were already there in 1998?
A single, Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, you can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.
It will be the case the day before the day of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 at 9 p.m..
This action is taking place in Prague in the arena Incheba, Brno to Fléda and Ostrava to Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
In late night, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song will be sung together the group canceled "The Tap Tap "End of the world.
The purpose of the consultation is to collect financial means (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the multipurpose training center Studeo located in Prague in the institute Jedlička.
The price of a ticket to this concert is CZK 400, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the presale tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.

Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed has been involved in a number of projects of the agency.
Poland's road to space has, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Poles enthusiasts working on space flights; they did not always understanding.
I would like to mention for example the conference of A. Šternfeld astronomical observatory of Warsaw on December 6, 1933, in the course of which he presented ideas from the leading edge of his "Introduction to space travel."
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left viewers cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski became interested in its work.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to space travel."
The Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 -- 1966) subsequently became a big propagator of astronomy and space travel.
It published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote several books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became an initiator of the world-renowned Astronautics, its contribution was particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the hidden face of the Moon craters.
As early as 1925 was built in Poland a car intended to be a rocket engine.
It is unfortunately neither the author nor the details of this project.
It is not clear if the rocket was used to propel or impede the car.
The only information known on this car are those of the press of the time.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to rockets.
The research was carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with faculty Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It records that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research stopped.
In 1937, a rocket of photoelectric hunting plans, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta -- torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza" of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were designed for military use of rocket motors.
Just before the war, all the rocketry projects were carried out by the Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy") which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, more work devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a question of society in the November issue of 1954 newspaper Problem, in which four more detailed articles are devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to space travel
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research was of the future.
At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) deployed efforts to enter in the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 -- 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He retained his office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the ATP made a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket Meteorological RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This rocket of a scope of 1800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
For the result was an upgraded version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage rocket Rehabilitation were initiated in the desert of Bledov.
The rocket had a length of 1.4 m and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should be able to perform specific scientific work -- the rocket RM-34 should have had a scope up 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind aloft.
But in 1963, all development work were stopped.
The rocket Meteor-1 development during the period of 1962 -- 1965, succeeded to the former type of rocket RM.
This rocket, designed with two floors and an initial weight, had a total of 510 cm length of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they are distinguished by the dimensions of the space to scientific tools.
The rocket Meteor-1A had a space with a volume of 0.4 per litre, whereas in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 per litre and in Meteor-1C 0.62 per litre.
The maximum of all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965 -- 1968, rockets Meteor-2 were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight trials started in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to a height of approximately 60 km.
Later versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It still mention the entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) COSPAR in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee two years later.
In the framework of program Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after the second Vladimír Remek, cosmonaut non-soviétique of this program.

The repeal of the law on public utility work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Law on the work of public utility.
This decision has raised a lively discussion in public opinion.
There is no doubt interesting to examine this issue in a broader point of view.
The directed economic systems towards liberalism, both in the EU in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that different economic entities as well as national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the principle of the freedom of trade and the free movement (without limitations) of private capital ally to unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labor (wage) generate tension on prices.
It should be put under the meaning of this term: a producer tries by the importation of the goods sold to the bottom taken to resist economic competition in "making the more expensive price of competitor, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
At the macro level, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy at low prices, or disappear. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where the labor prices are high in comparison to other economies.
Given that the private capital has no responsibility of the social point of view and thus of responsibility vis a vis the unemployment it creates social charges of the State necessarily increase.
All of this is the perfect unwillingness of contractors to pay taxes and to make economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race to profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
unscrupulous practices of private capital to create a situation in which the Governments of various economies of different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition to artificially lower the level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are their own people to the mercy of private capital without taking into account of the social collapse.
This occurs primarily in the amendments of the laws in force.
The objective is to compel economically on its own population to accept the diktat of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs on the one hand, by a system of economic constraints in the case of long-term unemployment and the other by the restriction of the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result, a growing poverty and the deepening of differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, it has existed for many years of public distribution points for food for the poor who can not meet their needs with their own work.
Already by millions the number of such persons.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that such employees receive wages that the State is obliged to pay a surcharge they reach the subsistence minimum.
One such scandal has for example been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economy of almost all the Member States of the EU's southern generated, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the company, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or eke out a living with poverty wages, in the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital investment in their countries.
It must here to ask the question: where will this capital?
If it comes from other countries of the EU, then poverty from one country to another; this capital can not come, or when a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or Africans will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also concerns the whole of Latin America.
The liberal theory and media say, to get bored with it, that the State can not make capital investment in its own economy, that economy led led to economic disaster.
The private capital fiercely defends the idea that the State can not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
It must wonder if private capital does not influence and, even, is not now, according to its own selfish interests, and the same policy, the State as a whole.
The answer to this question is certainly yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually omnipotent lobby and present in all States.
It is a desperate situation occurring in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not indictable.
In Germany, the situation is such, that due to lack of financial resources, national ministries, delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All the power is not the people, as the state constitutions of Western type, but of powerful financial groups for their own interests.
It is clear that democracies oriented toward liberalism are now quickly to face the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long failed states and functions were assigned by the violence.
The beating of bribes, favors received unlawfully, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The kickbacks and corruption have proliferated without limits and the people go to elections with votes have already been sold." ... "The honest people looking any functions, it was once again that the State was 8 months without Consuls ... ' It began really to say that the solution to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it should choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos to Pompey, but César irreversibly transformed the democracy in an absolutist system.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and advance the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to make sweeping reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in unscrupulous liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of things, may be regarded as the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies of type as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites ignore totally the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises which we are now witnesses as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the law on public utility work is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the level of the population.
This trend is in systemic effect.
The solution is in socio-political reforms to be covered, which will increase investment in the capital of the State in the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.

Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"There will never and never will," said Sting in the song "Fragile which the main refrain is "don't forget how much we're fragile."
"If my son did not want war, would not," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on her death bed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions are high.
Some take Israel's side, on the grounds of its right to self-defence and by other Palestinians in the role of terrorists, support the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and Israel as a terrorist State.
I don't think on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its recurrent waves of killings; after all, the current population of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in the present political situation and the beginning of the violence have not lived.
I would like to offer readers a point of view located behind the Iron Curtain," on which mainly of still present tensions already since more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small bout of Middle East countries.
Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to the other study, from my own understanding of that, or more exactly the group, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these individuals acting independently or if they were their acts to the throne to someone who led their acts on the basis of clearly defined objectives.
We need to acknowledge that we live in an era where global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration causing some powers has not been done in the course of a single generation.
Among families with unique astronomical wealth the Rothschild family, which might be seen as the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I do not excluded).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s the 19th century, they have acquired the first global press agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and that had always served to them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their property or both.
They have major interests in almost the majority of the world's central banks and prepare or lead wars against countries in which they have not yet of such shares (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 5, 7, after the invasion of Iraq after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, since Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Any person who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to Bank of America of Rothschild and began to issue its own money during the civil war (government, I) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue its own money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, the MP Louis McFadden has been poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a lawsuit against the EDF for having triggered the Great Depression of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level has resulted in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war had for objective to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second should remove colonialism, especially in the UK, and the third should reduce the world's population between 0.5 and 1 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort, creating a single world religion (ecumenism nothing other than the beginning of such a solution) and, ultimately, gain an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos -- the order after the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to avoid the recurrence of crises such as those that they led in 1907).
After having managed to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia in causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly by a German surrender without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of Czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers have left politicians create a latent conflict situation: they have an imposed enormous war reparations to Germany as well as generating the conditions of a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they just then put a strong enough leader, showing the finger of blame, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who should play the role (she actually) fifth column to the fire and start a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, whose aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (returned to Zion).
Balfour Report referred to above laid the foundations of a mass migration of Jews to Palestine and friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler has broken the chains in which international bankers had initially; or if any of this was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of European Jewry in concentration camps created the foundations of the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the second world war, the foundation of the State of Israel has lit a fire hazards that cause a third world war.
If international bankers are going to war, the Jewish population to be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the generally Muslim or Arab population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (just to see how people bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong creates another wrong depending on a circle of endless violence and where, at the origin of everything, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world?
will make the difference between the citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as we, the international bankers do to people their own candidates in elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a politician loyal fascistoid, vis a vis international bankers, which is to start a war with Iran, which could, in view of the accession of this country to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) to expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of all the world's oil (naval corridor has a width of 2 miles) and a destruction of the global economy.
Under what light are now held by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is implementing an electronic chip at birth as a fully controlled.
"What they are all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave to focus on the main or the front iron mark, so that it can either buy or sell the one that is not the name of this monster or the turnover of its name.
must understand: that whoever has the good sense of the figures of this monster.
This issue is human and it is six hundred and sixty six."

The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob consisting of Islamist students took stormed the American Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 diplomats hostage.
They should be released in exchange of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime over several decades.
The situation did not provide positive outcome to the US administration, it could not, in effect, abandoning the Shah, because it would severely shaken the confidence of his allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, blow later compounded by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats kidnapped were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their plight provoked a wave of solidarity and a sense of the U.S. anti-Iran.
The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980.
The film actor and director Ben Affleck's Argo, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it is occupied, escaped six employees of the embassy.
After complicated saga, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them to Iran through a coverage incredible: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a crew came to locations for the filming of a movie to show of science fiction.
Combination of genres
The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the story more credible, specialized magazines were state film project, of press conferences were organized and a fake production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained long secret, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez.
The Affleck film is an unusual combination of several types.
It is a part of a political thriller designed realistically, but also a "caper movie," the story of a successful coup, of a betrayal -- such as, for example, in the Ocean's trilogy eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The environments are: Tehran sequences of documentary style (in subtitled sequences are iconic photographs of the time of the events and the manner in which, thanks to those photos, those situations have been transcribed in the film, no large differences)
lighter parts of Hollywood, treaties with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then the scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone ...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
The actor ridiculed, he became a respected director and its acting ceased generating sarcastic remarks.
Argo is his third feature after the dark police "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first film Affleck is not in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that put his first films over Hollywood standards.
Affleck is also proof of this sense of the atmosphere where the role of Tehran in Argo" is "by Canada.
The best scenes of the film takes place in streets, at the reconstruction of the facts; the original sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity that also suggests the confusion and the unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given place, wrote a page in history.
Affleck and his staff have a similar effect in fictitious scenes (the false crew in the bazaar of Tehran).
Too many shares at too many places
The director had just a subject is in fact little exciting scenes in the film sense of the term.
It is, well, he sometimes added certain elements to the reality and here, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a phone call and the continuation of the runway on landing in America are pretty far-fetched).
The Argo weakness lies in its nature dissipated, owing to the need to show too many events too many different locations.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman is completely charming in their role of Hollywood cooperators, their characters have earned a larger place and what is not, far from it, only in this case.
The film Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, it is with moderate interest in assessing the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.
It causes the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet, somehow, unfinished to this day, and as an example of the excessive representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it made the case.

Rules for balloons, bananas and the circus
The server at bankovnipoplatky. com, which conducts each year a public inquiry on bank charges the most absurd, decided, at present, to launch the competition's rules or ideas from "the workshop of the EU "the most absurd.
"The fact that the EU intends, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the direction of European big business has been at the origin of our decision," said the newspaper Právo organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
Among mentioned nonsense, there already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women were an advantage for what is life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report any other ideas until the end of the year also incredible "the workshop of the EU".
"The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013," informed Nacher.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the obligation to add organic components of the fuel, which has detrimental consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small quantity of a hazardous substance or the directive concerning the size of cages chickens, which has led the increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued by the past against the prohibition of the use of the expression "butter spreads or the withdrawal of the sale of traditional light bulbs.
The quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimetres.
The European administration is often under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic is the demands of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, to the origin of the fact that the bananas in the Union, must not be of a size less than 14 cm or submit an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was not that the harmonization of national standards not homogeneous that complicated the trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing guidelines are a waste of food.
The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the EU Regulation last year that must appear on the balloons a warning that children under 8 years of age must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has made reference to a U.S. survey that balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of child deaths by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age in blowing trumpets of fair.
Here also, on a bizarre ideas.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, any person with an official function within the EU can not use the name "Macedonia" and, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" grouping of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky. com has appointed in this investigation, the Regulation mentioned above, in addition to some of the nonsense of the Union concerning the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set the maximum volume for food reserves may find themselves on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic beyond then, for example, volumes set for canned mushrooms and risqua, of this fact, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey have found interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of awarding a grant for the granting of subsidies.
These ideas are not, however, not from Brussels but of Prague.
"The fact of not having the sea give us.
We will request a refund to the European Union". This is expressed, in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
It argued that, because of our production of wheat, and continued to purchase so-called "interventionist", the State was found with full stocks that he had then export.
According to Palas, the EU ought to pay us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is a long distance from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the request of the Czech Republic and held a tender for the purchase of wheat from country without maritime access.
Subsidies for grants have been proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) should, in practice, be used to write grant applications granted by Brussels.
The EU said: "bizarre regulations are rare."
If the regulations are often criticized in the Member States, the view of many experts, the efforts of the EU regulation and improvement of the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of general development, rather than deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the Union, to fight to Brussels for the right to use specific designations for these traditional products (fight which it does not always winner) brings out strong emotions among Czech citizens.
If the term of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for which the appellation "Tuzemský rum" back home in the 19th century, our producers have been replaced by the name "Tuzemák".
Only the alcohol products of cane sugar, and not to sugar beet, can bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products from the EU, is now internationally known as the "Feta cheese company or the Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary") carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň ("Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr") and the hops of Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").
The gingerbread Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Cornets of Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.

People want that I saved the Republic, but I am not a fan, said Senator Okamura
Senator, how was the idea to stand in presidential elections?
This is not to be a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not candidate anywhere.
But I see more as the country was robbed in the last twenty years, thieves are not locked and increase taxes and the retirement age.
I had not the ambition of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that does not please me, then I try to find a solution for that change.
And as I have over 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other options for influencing the situation that I submit to presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly to the Château (N. d. T.: the seat of the presidency).
Is it that you do not turn their backs to those who elected you?
I have always said that I will in the battle for the Château depending on the results of the senatorial elections
Subsequently, I said that if I was elected senator, I would to presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is not merely an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the strongest influence and the broader mandate.
The problem is not only that we as a nation râlons at the bar or in front of our TV, but it is also that we cough, those who are trying to make the change.
Added to this is the press that scrapping the reputation of people and confused freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
It has, for example, said to my statement that I bribes or that I was the adviser Jiří Paroubek.
Now your visions.
You have started the fight for the Château with the themes as a criminal and material responsibility of the politicians and retroactive beyond 20 million tax returns (CZK).
You must to this end to change the law.
As president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for a liberal profession constitute activities of a tourist guide, I won.
The problem is the politicking: when someone comes in from the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent, a member of any party, I have much more likely to receive the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have an advantage, without categorization and dogma advocates, to each party that is best for our countries and implement it.
You consider you as a human right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people put me rather to the left.
For me, that this is a bit to the left or right, this is not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me, this is not that people are left or right but to bring people together.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act as impartially against bad ideas.
Will you go when someone said to you that you are a populist?
But what you said, that he not?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a purpose and a vision.
You try to bring you.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals which I have been implemented by the world and of recognized experts have spoken about this.
But without the support of parliament, the only thing left of slogans.
You survivrez not long in politics with this.
Do you that if you are going to see people and talk to them, you'll get in, for example, to impose the criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and the public opinion and to bring them to my camp to impose.
If I was elected president, this would not be a problem of the live broadcast television to my request to the Chairpersons of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the criminal and material responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there will be a strong personality that identify abuse, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president in direct elections, it has been obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I, clearly, be a fan, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try and find allies for my opinions and my views.
I just started in politics and I tried to obtain the support of the majority of my program.
I try, alone, can make a difference, and if it doesn't, I'll quit in six years and I get back in the private sector.
It is a bit like if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person may not make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová revealed oil fraud.
I presented myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of people have not voted and who did have, for the most part, given voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are both independent.
The people have elected a Senate unlikely to impose any changes.
Despite everything, I, for my vision, for example, the direct election of mayors and prefects of the regions.
Do you base your own party?
No, not yet, because I do not have the time to verify if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I did not have the financial means.
I did not have more money for my presidential campaign, I have that twenty thousand on my account "transparent".
You don't have money?
You talk of tax returns, what is yours?
I estimated to approximately 60 million the value of my personal property.
I to a ground of a value of $25 million, an apartment in Prague for a value of 10 million, another apartment worth $8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth $3.5 million and a Skoda Superb a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
Either way, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I have always liked James Bond, traveling in the car, was gallant with women and fighting against harm and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a heritage of a value of $60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for this campaign.
I am in debt?
I have already invested $2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not a great interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live, for example, pay the English school of my son who is 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to make money, I am not present in any elections.
You will therefore continue commercial activities in order to live?
Do you assert that you put down your activities?
But this is not linked to the amount of such earnings.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my Deputy will spring the direction of travel agency.
People like that I am a Good Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But although I live of something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you contractor?
I won and I still win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was President, I would end to my business.

The firm of architects MVRDV prove that true adventures are not only imaginative case. As evidence, he need only contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly built -- 2 photos
"I find that this building is fun, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a busy on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer in a nearby business, said: "Yes, it is actually fine, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, one will not voluntarily in one of these libraries of yore, no?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom community that is attractive to the doors of Rotterdam, holds a unique record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest rate of education of the Netherlands.
To give a few neurons to brain drain, the city decided, a few years ago, contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the banknotes in the form of small, beautiful painted miniatures in reinforced concrete.
The success of the offensive cultural remained limited.
It is as well that the city authorities realized that there is only one way to take a lead on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold and creative bar diagrams of witty and often cynical buildings, agreed the project with his usual unflappability and ran the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
And while members of the board is still watched, bewildered and shrug, Maas, the brash, empila books of choice by order of size to a pyramid, and ended his speech substantiated arguments activists by a "common expensive!"
The now, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros came from land.
The building is in a revitalization project with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses, for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
It is as well that this drab town that until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a mayor of a staggering ugliness, whose white walls invite to think that they support a dairy, a contemporary architectural work has been enriched.
The most important is that Spijkenisse now has the first cultural building to the public of its history.
The long path towards the reading
First impression: Eldorado's book under glass to cheese.
Of course, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture are open to you when you the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.
The procedure made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the soil in Dutch bricks and elegant streetlights unequivocally speak the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
Efforts already regard public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play to the ball.
And everywhere, books, books and even books.
"Normally, library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the classical space configuration and open spaces of the reading of the Interior to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been cleverly constructed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the central technical building.
A special beauty lies in black shelves of the library, which are sometimes of wainscoting, sometimes railings, sometimes of stair railings.
A new experience for the sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and construction engineers want not unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
It is as well that one day we found in a farming business Frisian a ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, used for years a millimeter of a synthetic membrane as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and of playing for time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then we can throw.
For the library, the membrane has been compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates with a thickness of 4 cm.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) change of color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, including the smell of a new car and sports footwear.
On top of 105 steps is the summit of the mountain.
After nearly 500 metres, the literary café offers a magnificent view over the city, but also Dutch nuggets and potted ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but above all to maintain the ideal level of moisture in the air of the literary mountain.
Donations for the new soul
"This is incredible, but despite all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in the area of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is geothermally.
Although the mountain of books is the sun under a glass bell, lights that shortly the procedure, even on sunny days.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the facade of glass used in relation to sun visors, intercepting a large part of rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds can do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the computer system, was already risky to enter in the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, Professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, describes the same Boekenberg as "soul finally found "Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has helped fill in the gaps of the library that was not yet fully furnished (today, 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are from all sides.
For the architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between individual citizens and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if this is just for decoration."
It is as well as MVRDV has reached the main discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity."
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Although it may seem young and poorly educated.
It is finally a new point of departure for the birth of an identity.

Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany has chosen the abstention during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain the status of an observer State to the United Nations.
But it was then chosen forbearance.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin needed to be careful, because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it not only supports the US position.
Germany wanted to assert his independence, but not be too critical toward Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention during the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Germany finds difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is in the process of reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore face a number of fronts.
It is expected that they play a more independent role, but they are not used.
I believe that they are yet to find this role, but are on the path of a foreign policy "more normal".
An external policy, such as in France or Britain
What then concretely the term "normal" foreign policy to the Germans?
It shows the commitment to adopt independent positions from those of the U.S. and European partners, including with regard to national records.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other major powers: this is why Germany should protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced Germany's position vis-à-vis the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention of the United Nations?
Germany has first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
Therefore Berlin must take care not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
This is without doubt a decisive point.
However, I would not too much, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship.
But there is a key element in any case in German strategic thinking.
Germany to affect its relations with the United States in choosing the abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not so serious that she was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even that Germany will most respected.
In effect, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions concerning the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
However, the United States have announced their veto in a clear voice.
The opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
There has always been differences because of American domestic politics.
I believe that the Obama Administration secretly is evidence of a great deal of understanding towards the European position.
However the political configuration of the country, the Government can, of course, not defend its position publicly.
I believe that true differences of opinions are not always so large that they seem.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not keen to the respect of the policy of Benjamin Netanyahu.
Germany finds difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of major European partners, on the other hand?
I think that it does not facilitate things for the Germans.
Of course, this would be a little more simple for the Germans if there is a coherent and uniform European policy, but today, this is not the case.
They can not register within a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are currently in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will in the future a locomotive role will Europe adopt a European position.
This is not just for Germany, particularly because relations with Israel.
This issue has always been difficult.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that mark more independence.
Germany it play a role player on the international scene, Germany is only assume a key role?
Or she has still to take leading roles?
Germany still is not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country has still to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, the crisis of the euro, is that each time that Germany decides to weigh more, many feelings antiallemands can be heard.
It does not facilitate things for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a far more difficult position that the United States.
It must deal with neighbors and very diverse opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, U.S. influence on the European policy only decrease, but at this time, the EU does not fill that vacuum, then who is left?
The Germans will simply play a more important role.
And even if it does not like them, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less popular, it is the life!

"Protection of Trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo ... what is it really?
Behind this name is a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark as such protection that the company that bears the name can not file a complaint.
And even if it could, it is not sure that it would succeed.
"It is increasingly difficult for aliens to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, the lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of the right of ownership in the Far East.
Each week, a new record arrives on my desk.
The imitators only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copy legally as Puma, the sportswear manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a file cabinet in which the records are made to the trademark office of Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company has filed the mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created in a part of the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is a known fact that the Chinese are now the world champions of the copy and the violation of intellectual property.
In major cities, is shopping centres to several floors that do sell virtually that of counterfeits.
The case of Pattloch are however different: its constituents do address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office to formally gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", of the parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who are married to rich men.
The Chinese authorities say nothing for which to reproach themselves.
"That is bad for business, it must combat this trend," requires Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, damage to reputation is enormous."
The financial losses and costs of justice are in millions for the sectors concerned, particularly with respect to the expensive products.
According to the data of the CLSA market analysis company, in China, with an annual volume of € 15 billion, the third global market for luxury goods and expanding the most quickly.
However, it is not easy to cancel registrations doubtful of the register of marks and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported trial during which the Court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period, criticised the name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant did not, it may even be obliged to pay money to the plagiarist, because it would hurt its brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that prevails.
famous cases include graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that was to redeem the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
That is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, Volvo, logger used before a blue and white logo that recalled that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had the change.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the terms of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The trademark office CTMO Beijing admits, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would be spent the last year of an "emergency situation in the course of the work to a new-found normality."
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures have fallen 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases of this type have been closed, representing an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 procedures remain outstanding to the office.
Action is expensive
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million of trade mark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time on the index for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also for the total number of trademark law, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of the registration fee.
In other words, each record reported average 1,348 yuan, or € 160.
A legal battle costing much more, as the case of the German family firm Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company fought against a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans could obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, the impersonator could maintain its Chinese rights on the trademark Freudenberg.
"It is our fault, because the names of the family can not be protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, president of the leadership of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities to Munich.
The trademark office had therefore rejected the objection of Munich.
Freudenberg has obtained from the following two bodies, but the other side continued fighting until today.
The vigilance is
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praised the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds: "the procedure is lengthy, stressful and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archives had even review the acts of the last hundred years to provide proof.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed a "large sum in euros in vain to the opposing party to six figures" to resolve the issue.
"That is what it is for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East or even beyond Europe.
This would be the case if this region of imitators ensured the exploitation of protected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer to submit the name of Freudenberg in Germany for a company of production of footwear and leather.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is called for."
Pattloch and advising him to German companies show a high degree of caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they rely on international law of trademarks, foreigners should rather save everything that is likely to be protected also in China," said Wentzler.
Otherwise, costs can be much more important than those of the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the legal battle in the last act of his drama, the company should pay a licence fee to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler.
Or, we lose our place on the segment of the market in question.

World Day of AIDS: stomp, sing, help
The choir Imbongi repeat to Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland looked forward to their arrival.
Here is the story of a relationship that is much more that a distance of 8.733 kilometres.
First, they tap their feet: the cowboy boots, shoes, the escarpins moccasins for women and for men seeking the pace in the soil of the foot. Very soon, they are.
One, two, three, four.
Secondly, the voices of singers increase slowly -- low, alto, tenor and soprano -- they prevail, bewitch and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years almost loses his canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with its wild gestures of flexibility.
We Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the Music Room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years, the geneticist in human medicine man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each singer has different words, in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in some regions.
Being helped to help themselves
The UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimated that 34 million people worldwide are living with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa.
The Swaziland 245.000 infected persons.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany through the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you could become the sponsor.
This guarantees the child the money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meals to the exhibition center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storytelling" or "praise singer".
No one can not speak Bantu fluent in the language in this region, but all can sing.
For almost 10 years, the choir repeat songs in this language that it has brought in Germany for now make to his native region: the South Africa.
Because 8.733 km as the crow flies to Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the power of voice of the German choir.
40% of people
The village has about 2,000 residents, some live in small huts of straw or soil and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has won their parents.
At Esitjeni, may be seen in smaller evils besetting the Swaziland: the higher the rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population accept almost never proven male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a reduction of the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is the carrier of human immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in their mid-thirties.
When a group traveling in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis have especially seen many children in the street that it not only lacked parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without school, there simply no perspective.
At the beginning, it was that of a few persons who undertook personally to make a few euros each year to be able to send a child to school and providing a hot meal per day.
But just a year later, the choir was "Voices for Africa", an association which has since almost professional manner of AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among bacterial STIs, syphilis, the chlamydiées and gonorrhoea (or gonorrhea).
The common STIs are HIV, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STD.
What are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea are often among men who have sex with other men.
The Institute Robert-Koch believes that sexual contact between men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis on five reported in Germany.
The adult heterosexual infections related to chlamydiées, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal) gonorrhea and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of the spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur among this group.
Among young people, a rate of infections linked to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other groups of the population.
According to surveys in Europe, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of syphilis more than doubled in 10 years: from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is decreasing.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the emergence of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also spread infection by lubricating or by close personal contact.
The experts therefore recommend to anyone changing sexual partners often spend regular breast examinations.
Most quickly diagnosed STIs can be treated successfully and late sequelae can be prevented.
Through sponsorships, donations, but mainly to funds that are full members through their votes across Germany, accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," states Annette Lennartz, the association's president.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of itself and that always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It shall also ensure that orphans are well housed, in one of their grandmothers for example.
The sucker, as well as the so-called old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them are up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and to ensure that they are traveling each day to the hour to the school in their uniforms.
An orphan who was more person is allowed in a safe place, in a PPASA, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as two cooks preparing daily meals to more than 200 starving children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a school of couture and permit the construction of two barns. With the assistance of the American for the health organization PSI, the association has organized a HIV test for many people.
This does not of itself, because even if the disease is clearly visible in the entire country, it is still a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it is a subject that affects the sexuality."
It is curious, coming from a country in which the king has 14 wives official.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
The polygamy to the establishment of democracy.
These mores sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
yet found condoms at every street corner, says Annette Lennartz," but almost nobody uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
To foster some cultural exchange, choristers of Imbongi go together in all travel two or three years in South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, of courage, confidence and black identity that the number of inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still during the apartheid era.
The bus full of white singing in African language is a sign of recognition as it brings not only good humor and joy, but hard sometimes as a tear to some formidable border guards.
The bus takes them always to Esitjeni, where singers to visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Valley of the Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, you find the light," say the people there.
And after a journey of 8.733 km as the crow flies, Heidelberg, before these singers to return their feet in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Str, also found the light.

Messenger: NASA discovered the presence of ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice could reach 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closer to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as the three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet continuously diving in the shade.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 cm up to 20 metres.
The water is probably of comets or asteroids that have perhaps hit Mercury.
However, no link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of the presence of life on the planet," says the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
Temperatures on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how the water and other essential elements, arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Inaperçus inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the land, such as small pores through which we observe the infinite.
The image from a camera developed by German researchers of the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, that orbits the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This infrared detail of a photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and pink points, more difficult to identify, are "born" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, to 6,500 light years away.
The Spitzer telescope NASA has photographed the flamboyant brilliance of a dying star.
The circle in the form of donut is composed of elements that the star is when she died.
In the Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years of Earth, the gas and dust to form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope has photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster called "seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope is more value in colors.

It is 700 light-years in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarities with a continent's earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal picture and the infrared camera to observe a dramatic hue.
Only Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is on the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings were the remains of a moon of Saturn that has disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without trace.
One of the largest and most net photographs that has taken the Hubble telescope is that of the galaxy's Tourbillon.
According to the color, the photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousands of light years away.
The name of the Trifid comes from the Latin word "E. trifidus" (divided, shared in three) since three shiny streaks of dust into the heart of the place of birth of stars.
The astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of Ophiuchus: 400 million light-years of Earth, two nuclei merging galaxies rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope has observed the birth of stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you do not like the abbreviations technical, you can use his nickname of "Southern" wheel of fire.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the nebula of Iris, in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula lies 1,400 light-years and is composed of particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the common household dust.
This photo was developed from optical and X-ray photographs taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle consisting of black holes found to 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the larger spiral galaxy" GC 1810."
In this cloud is the group of the brightest young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of Celestial always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are linked by the Rosette Nebula, also create permanently young stars to 5,000 light-years of Earth.
In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, it is not yet in place of dust, there's gas.
Scientists believe that it is born shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our eyes on the universe: the major telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo does use a year later to observe the stars.
Since mirrors with optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and through them, it was possible to see ever more distant in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror image had a diameter of 5 meters.
In Arizona, United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors with each 8.4 metres in diameter.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias to La Palma, Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reached 10.4 m diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter reached approximately 11 metres.
The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of vertical angle, which restricts mobility.
The telescope Hobby-Eberly Texas is also set at the level of vertical angle.
Its unique features to its large collection of light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to mirror those of the biggest telescopes in the world.
Scientists listen the universe to the search for alien signals to the aid of radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
The telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Any person owns a computer can contribute to the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or the search of extraterrestrial intelligence") using the computing power of its machine.
Overview on the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ('' the Very Large Telescope") a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope may inform the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large telescope European (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.
His main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 items of mirrors.
However, the telescope can not take photographs until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were regarded as the world's largest.
They wore two mirrors of a diameter of 10 metres each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the observatory's who observed the sky with the Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror reaches 30 metres.
This illustration can admire.
However, the most important space images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, we book of images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler seeks exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates final preparations before the launch of the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space in early 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first infrared space telescope's mirror has a diameter of about 6.5 metres.
The telescope will mission of finding the projected light by the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists think that the South Pole of Mercury is also of the ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
The radar data indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to circling around of Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.

Drink daily butter, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey on a country, in which it is still relatively young at age 97.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey on a country, in which it is still relatively young at age 97.
The trip in the Talysh Mountains is a romantic, unbridled.
In many turns of the road, the small bus cahote torrential rivers along forested hills, and small farms.
All is green and fertile, almost in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is not just a few kilometres.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh live, about which little is known, if not whether they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and that they have a very long lifetime.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastronne with overly aggressive architecture of the Soviet era which does not at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
The European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to go the 323 miles, because the road was the only way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country needs to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist site.
"Baku became famous in May through the Eurovision competition, and the next year, there will be by the festival of the world's oldest people," explains Fatulayeva.
It is the museum's director of longevity, the only museum of the kind in the world.
It may discover the lives of about eight decades of Talysh region which have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years.
Having a child to 136 years
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who was 168 years.
It is not, however, a birth certificate.
And when we think that the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of Müslümov appears more than doubtful.
"It was born in this region in 1805, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man allegedly married three times and it would have been 23 children. At the age of 136 years, he would have designed a girl.
Şirali Müslümov would it wrong a few decades in calculating its age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, it has also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia.
"There are also strikingly older persons in some parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz," in Sardinia also, there are people living incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, but that no civil registry.
Each day, a glass of melted butter
It is, however, that the people of the region of Lerik often reach a worthy age of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
What is the reason of longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes.
However, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believes that it is a question of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that meals rich in calories Talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the youth of people? The Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years old, it is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, which states have 143 descendants, lives in a modest house, as it is typical to see in the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground next to a churn, it beats the content.
Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who are long adults.
Two small children tumble also in the house.
In the kitchen, it prepares tea for guests served in glasses armadus typical in form of belly.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hiding a dark blond dreadlocks that his son reveals with pride.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and it is as well that I never lost and that they have retained their color.
"I never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She always eaten this from his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my lifetime, I never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then, she spoke of her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But any improved when the "beloved" father Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of the propaganda surprised in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has led his country like a dictator, almost knows no limits in Azerbaijan
It has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him.
Nevertheless, the older people of Azerbaijan did not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros) for his retirement, an amount that ensures a good life in the region.
And maybe the son long greying of Mirzayeva was right: "seniors enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.

The "human rights" not in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
rival demonstrations revealed the deep divide in the country.
The draft constitution based on the sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not short of words full of emotions.
We must make the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was for the entire people, but also especially Coptic Christians, liberals, Muslim and secular.
For all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition have fear.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile to the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, have temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its "to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world don't know really what to save this engineer of 61 years, holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California.
The judiciary be reversed?
The 234 articles hastily written by the Constituent Assembly majority Islamic of 100 people at a nighttime tour de force of 15 hours are worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the jurisprudence is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But the word "principles" really means?
It was and it remains a matter of interpretation, and it has good reason to fear that Islamists use vague wording and the legal maneuver to enforce a more strict interpretation of sharia law.
In any case it is that suggests a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all matters relating to the Islamic Shariah, the Al-Azhar university must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic institution of Sunni Islamic countries and his brilliance shines on the entire world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will the legislation, which would de facto guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are open to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of the military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts began to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also be read in the draft, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the State could check the contents of filmmaking art and literature.
Clearly, it is simply censorship.
In addition, no article specifically guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits insulting or defaming the Prophet Mohammed or his envoys.
However, the article defines not what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is prohibited to "offend people."
Is it draw a cartoon of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many issues are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and that, in his own words, will "very soon" the subject of a referendum for Egyptians.
"The revolution renait"
The opposition rallying for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in unusual harmony on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to sharia law before its entry into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we're going to win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of trying to foment a "coup against democracy".
"If it proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and on the reverse," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We're not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned", said that the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have not announced if monitor the referendum, which would entail its annulment.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the Muslim brotherhood, well organized, has called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
Veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who have participated in large numbers, chanting "the people want the application of the law of God."
"cleanses our country!", asked to Morsi, saying that "the Koran (their) Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic place Thahir, where everything began, would soon created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, it is this that Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood reported that the opponents of the Constitution, in the same way that its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by vote of the direction that the country should take.
The Islamists will certainly the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once."
Hafez Abu Saeda is anger against this constitutional process imposed which should continue until February and encompass all social forces.
This lawyer of the human rights of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were in prison or the courts under Mubarak.
It has done so not because it shared their vision of the world, but because that human rights are indivisible.
That is the reason for which he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not a time in the new Constitution," he says during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President to de facto all its powers," regrets Saeda.
However, a democracy can not function without the organizations of civil society.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, that watching the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could afford.
One protester on the place Thahir warns: "you accouchez a monster that it will be possible to control."

The rakfisk of Norway: is it the most fragrant of the world's fish?
The five million people in Norway are one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of extremely fragrant premises for a fish?
Take cheese.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothing.
Wait a week.
And you get the smell disturbing the rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, at approximately 3 a.m. Oslo.
The snow, the landscape is spectacular -- and this, pervasive smell permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled salt and fermented in water for a time -- the smell that you want it exhaling -- which can go up to a year.
When darkness settled and it's cold, the Norwegians gathered in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, incredible Fagernes, devoted to this culinary speciality.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, full-time local firefighter that so-called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people ingest small pieces of fish and to don a vast quantity of drink.
"Some people prefer the aquavit in rakfisk," adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I tried a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting under your nose, this is not bad -- it suggests to a sushi who spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in waterproof barrels of water to the air, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, a time many fermented, the fish is out and -- no doubt with direction undermined by alcohol -- ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work, emigrant primarily to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly -- more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals which richer countries was not so long that Norway, crossing the border to work.
The rakfisk is considered as something important, a vital element, as well as fragrant, the past of Norway.
This is the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive -- a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you € 10 each.
Norway does not often speak of it in the news, which is not to displease him.
Here, people are not willing to speak of the racist right-wing extremist Anders Breivik that killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they evoke this killing, they speak of "the incident of 22 July".
The Norwegians struggling to accept that one of their own in their peaceful country, could commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway should its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But the oil is not the single reason that justifies our success," says Anna, our waitress, to numbing blonde hair and blue eyes, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a shelf of rakfisk hand.
We -- How do you say, conservative people.
His English, like most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discrete, we do not like us to point out.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution -- everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries throwing money down the drain, over the years that have led to the global financial crisis, Norway has managed to keep its purse strings tight.
"Until you can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And the rakfisk", she adds in a carefree laugh.
I am standing in the snow and I am the queue to buy me anything to eat -- I've had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger consisting of momentum, a discovery, it is excellent.
But this night, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I reside is one of many places where serves the rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them -- or perhaps the most fragrant of them.
There was a TV presenter is a trademark bowties, surrounded plates of rakfisk.
It is the Eurovision competition.
"What have you score given the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?"
"Here our points, Harvard."
means of laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or perhaps it is because of the fumes of the fish.

The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, looks to the challenges ahead and to people's expectations, which are many.
The Mexico City traffic is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a barrage of security has been in place since Monday, blocking several key access road in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, receiving the presidential sash to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task lies ahead.
Mexico's economy is doing well, results that must to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is prey to a drug war that has already cost the life to about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has taken the commitment towards the Mexican people to reduce the violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I propose a new strategy in the field of security which will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A sprawling and populous state that encircles the capital city. In its country, opinions regarding this new leader are divided.
A direct human
In the idyllic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The local attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of new motorways M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, formerly dented and full of cracks.
Plates bearing his name are attached to the outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to put in place lasting change," said his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, a member of congress and Pena Nieto, the PRI of the M party.
In terms of safety and economy, we expect real change our country needs so badly.
After 81 years without fault in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace at Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party on Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects criticism of opponents who accuse the president of lacking charisma.
It is a human whole, very committed, with excellent vision of the country.
This is a great statesman and, above all, it knows to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
At Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under autoponts motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military were called to the rescue for the fight against drug gangs that are in the neighborhoods, and violence against women there are particularly serious.
In a disaster area, was found, dozens of bodies of murdered women in edge of discharge, in the course of the past two years.
More than 1,000 women have been killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place infamous for the number of innocent women who were murdered there.
Critics say Mr. Pena Nieto, at best, it has not managed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a house in concrete, typical of this ramshackle, Irinea Buendia fight to hold his tears when she shows me pictures of his deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, his family believe that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived home, it struck me that his body had been washed," says the lady Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and rigor mortis had set in.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross containing the word: Justice.
However, it is exactly this that the family has denied.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old gossipy, a fautrice of disorder, a pleurnicheuse.
They want to accept what they say and that we stay quiet.
"But this is not right that so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When the President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf Saturday, it will bear a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by the crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made the promise that it would its priority during its mandate.
"I hope that it will be as good as president when he was governor," said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, it is exactly this that the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.

Bradley Manning not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of abuse which Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during detention.
The trial focuses on Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning was in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have attempted to demonstrate, on Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information of any history of the U.S. Army -- has missed many opportunities to complain of ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military custody.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft.. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings made weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months in prison in Quantico, Virginia, found no complaint concerning his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that Manning be dismissed on the grounds that the kidnapping was in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This analyst of military intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source.
At the hearing Friday, Fein discussed with Manning forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he has been subjected to a maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked to Manning and recorded her answers.
When Fein mentioned forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that it reserved its guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had within the prison was "very professional."
The forms do not state any complaint for ill-treatment, many officers have directly questioned about his treatment in prison," said Fein.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns regarding a number of problems and that visiting officers had discussed its concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not recorded with the problems referred to.
"They wrote "no problems" (after having discussed the concerns) and for all, this meant that I had not raised problems," said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he was not complaining about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee that met to discuss the suicidal thoughts that he expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that its intention during the meeting was to change its restrictive status indicating a risk of injury."
The military reported that they had assigned this restrictive status -- a level below the close surveillance for suicide risk -- for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff know that I was okay, and I wanted that I cut this status ... in order to enjoy a better quality of life of my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and vanished once because of the heat.
He added that the fact of not having been informed of what it was going to happen or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought that I was going to die in this cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning has also added that the only objects which he had had a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and glasses.
It has tried to remain in motion, because sleep or lie down for the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning has also clarified that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eye, lit outside his cell.
If the guards were not his face when he turned the night, they up to see his face.
Manning's lawyer has filed a formal complaint to the treatments by Manning in January 2011.
Manning has been placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Friday, also, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after having been forced to sleep naked every night in his cell at Quantico, was forced to stand naked before the guards and other prisoners in the morning, during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time, he was not allowed to cover with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions, on Friday, Manning said he had deducted in the order of its warning that it would release its coverage that could hide her nudity, but it acknowledged that it had ordered the release.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, as he tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to itself.
Manning said to the officer that he could use the elastic from his underpants or its flip-flops to harm themselves, but that it had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of his experiences during his detention and that it reduce his sentence if he should be convicted before a court martial, a trial should be held early next year.
The defense has said that Manning plans to plead guilty of minor offences and to fight for the abandonment of other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who argued that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include the theft of public property or records, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information concerning national defense.
If all counts, he faces life imprisonment.

My identity crisis mexico-américaine
It said that many have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who are parties; they remind difficult periods to Mexicans, he said.
Navarrette said that the Mexico-américains trapped between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, before customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") another for "Extranjeros" ("Aliens").
I am standing still for several seconds, not knowing what to file lead me.
I grew up in central California, where the "Mexican" called me all my life.
It is an ethnic term, in the same way that the use of my friends in Boston when they say "Irish", or my New York friends when they say "Italian".
Secondly, I am now "Mexico-Américain".
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the land that my grandfather was born, need special qualifier or hyphens.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to manage a maintenance in one or the other language.
But I do not have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal person, and I can not lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I am led to the "Aliens".
I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto paid a visit to President Obama to the White House.
Generally, when leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and the trade.
Pena Nieto was also reluctant to speak of the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons that drive Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk the United States.
He wants to ally with the U.S. and Canada, and create a Union for the trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledged to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although it has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and embittered.
Most Americans have probably never thought to the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to assign writing half of their territory to the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, once a formal U.S. criticism against Mexico's formula, you start to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite -- complaints on how Americans infringe the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma seek the fight.
And yet, the more difficult for Mexico, the relationship is that the country has with the more than 35 million of Mexico-Américains living in the United States.
You want to address the subject of bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and its losers, and other persons to which the countries offers opportunities for in the country.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestry in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at any given time, a person, in our family tree, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And more often than not, this person was a profile -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc..
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we currently live the American dream, that we've been in good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that is the American dream that we live, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We attach to the United States.
Furthermore, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the elite do not like.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind us of a humiliating defeat and they, as if we were individuals of lower and not sufficiently Mexican strain.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will not be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never materialize parties.
And we would not get stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as of lost souls.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and immigrated legally to the United States when she was a child, remember that there is friction between Mexicans and the Mexico-Américains, because Mexicans more strongly assert their identity and the Mexico-Américains are upset.
Although it is a United States citizen, she has the sense to make part of the two countries.
In addition, many Mexico-Américains I know did not feel part of a country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, it sees us as Americans.
And the United States, we consider as Mexicans.
And now, for a little more complicated relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of the intelligentsia want closer of the Diaspora.
They want the Mexico-Américains work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, in representing its interests in the United States.
We must explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country visit and put the pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
This will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And, considering the wage gap, corruption and violence linked to the drugs that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You'll get only, amigos.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they have treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Américains their want always treated the way in which the members of their family have been there so long.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Do will never have sustainable peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
A further bloodshed suggests that such hope is vain.
While still futile to know that the same arguments began, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near the metropolis of Tel Aviv, Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has shattered, and we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their fight yet a little more.
However, there was every reason to believe that this could help to overcome this impasse deadly.
A war which does no losers or no winner
At first glance, it seems difficult for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire provided on 21 November, the fighting this week have reinforced the strength of supporters on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip since 2007, targueront having forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and returned the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most overcrowded and impoverished corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other party of the Palestine currently hands their rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders could say that the time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas is rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, is for Hamas; as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of Golf.
The Hamas members gloat and say that the growing Islamist curve around Israel, Lebanon, the Hezbollah militia in the north, where dominance, from Syria, where the rebels to the Islamist trend may reverse Bashar Al-Assad, and Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and the most central of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily to public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as an important player which can not be excluded even by America and Israel.
Meanwhile, supporters of the hardline Israel draw opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been handed over in the box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and of many Hamas's missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will able to sleep at night over a period of time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas to be the origin of the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, including under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including by the separation barrier, which encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and that protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with a more hawkish party, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the approach of the election of January 22, a beautiful party.
Why spoil those pesky Palestinian in giving them a state?
If they run the West Bank, would they not rockets, as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind the wall and hit as soon as they leave the head.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; but it may that the Arab Spring changes.
Even if Islamists took power in Egypt and elsewhere like little Israel, their priority is to tackle the problems in their own countries.
The Israel defense budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Start a war with the local superpower will not new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire which bodes well for the future -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that is becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel -- a bit like the bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression weakens already democracy in the Jewish state, and the demographics exacerbates this problem to the extent that the Arab population is increasing.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years for Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front.
The two sides need to be driven by those outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people found by each side, and most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of the territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small hope, and short-term, is that the ceasefire will outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to put an end to the flow of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state next to a state proposal to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has a vested interest that Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he has not submitted his own peace plan.
To return to the White House, it seems equally unwilling to establish one.
This is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is done by a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

The laws for neutral packages of cigarettes came into effect in Australia
Warnings and pictures of diseased organs are dark green packages that are all the same, regardless of the mark
This Act entered into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking parents.
Outside of different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages.
It is the most strict regime in the world of packaging of tobacco.
The Australian federal government has stated that the objective was to discourage smoking among youth in removing any representation glamour.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26 years, 99% of opportunity that they ever begin.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their image," said federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown by example that children with the crown of a logo to a princess."
While Australia has the lowest smoking rates in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers have said that it would black market trade, which will facilitate access to cheaper cigarettes.
"adverse consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell more of counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others have said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Zico Ha Import Pty Ltd., a small family business, said that the application of cigarette cases, including silicone mask horrific packaging, has risen sharply since two months ago that British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost at the High Court of Australia.
Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is pending renewal of the stock.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population group targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV ads, the sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide tobacco marketing of cigarettes, is now available online.
Australia has prohibited the advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it can not prevent foreign sites do.
"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you have no more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the hotspot by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase of some contributions of ordinary people in favor of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask ourselves whether it is a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and is the penalty to a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry is focused on the new regulation into force rather than on marketing.
The industry went to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice -- these countries reported to WHO that the trade is at an unfair disadvantage, although none of these countries has had significant trading with Australia.
A decision of the WTO should be taken in the course of the year 2013.
Plibersek said that the Government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on the packaging.
Canada was the first country to make mandatory warning pictures on packs in 2001.
At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The tougher laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to those photos.
The photos do not bother me.
I know them.
"You take a cigarette and you ranges the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package which contained a photo of tumors of the mouth.
To be frank, the only reason that I will stop, it is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, said that the consistency of packaging made difficult the stowage of packages on display.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now, I need four hours," said Yu.
"The government had to prohibit them once and for all and we said OK, it is good, stop and put the key under the door," he said, lifting his hands.

In a world constantly connected, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours in an airport during the period of Thanksgiving, as our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.
Therefore, I have had sufficient time to consider the theme of boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Skip a half-day in an airport for a flight is boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract yourself (without forget duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specialized in the development of the child are the praise of boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us -- and our children -- bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting paths, even feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly before several types of screens, we know more than the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And not.
But I will return.
First of all, like many people, I thought that the problem was a rather recent phenomenon, particularly since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, said Peter Toohey, a Greco-Roman history professor at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The problem goes back to far," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke the boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there was the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed various different ways," said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After numerous publications and submitted the idea to a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that is "to do something, but to engage in an activity."
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task though it would like.
With the apathy, he says, there do not want to do something.
This is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the process, with a low mood and the sense that time passes slowly."
The problem may look like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be related, people who are bored tend to think that the problem of the environment or of the world, while depressed persons believe that the problem of them.
Sometimes, we think that we bored while it is in fact a problem of concentration.
In the framework of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have identified a more former experience in which participants were listening on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard, from the side room, the sound too high of a TV that had no report, others have just heard the TV, and the third group did not of course the soundtrack.
Those who have heard the TV to a low noise level have said that they were more bored than the other two groups -- they struggled to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult task or ownership, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you make a boring task," such as watch objects on an assembly line, the music can help you do not get bored."
In fact, he says, now, we know that when it wiggles or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are authorized to gigoter learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless," Professor Fenske said.
We've all at one time or another -- the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "scale of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Among the tasks that I made, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have the time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and have particular need of many and varied pacing.
But in general, adolescents are quickly blase.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in the individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which it contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents from seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It noted that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their duties to the home, while 23 percent reported bored when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3 per cent of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of today's boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "Adolescence is a period where boredom reached its highest level," because, in particular children and adolescents do not have a lot of control on what they want to do.
If I based my question: the boredom he is good for you?
Sometimes, as in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity," said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"The problem is the way that the brain found to inform you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N. Y. U.S..
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and you use that energy to play the guitar and cook, make your happiness.
But if you look at the TV, it makes you happy in the short term, but not the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give it an iPad, it will no longer, but it has not learned to handle alone or if autorégler, Professor Fenske said.
And "this autorèglement passes from one situation to another," he said.
Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more control in other areas.
I do not think that we should glorify boredom.
Like I do not think that we should criticize.
Feeling comfortable outside of constant excitement that generate activities and the technology is the goal towards which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to get bored more often, but the problem is acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people want, it is a means to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés", he added, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops."

In Colorado, no guidelines for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and football player in Colorado, was charged for something that soon became legal in his state: the pellets of possession of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car to Lamar, in fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After that the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco has received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for use in minor offences to consumption, each with a $100 fine and a court date.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it a?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado for legalizing the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a low drug use depends more than that of the law of the place.
Here and in Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been classified without result.
The police stopped charging adults age 21 and older for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors who are in more conservative districts in Colorado have called to speed up existing marijuana business and continue to charge people who have.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West vote now to prevent the sale of licensed marijuana stores opening by the State in their neighborhoods.
"Things are changing so rapidly that I don't know what the future holds," said Daniel J. Oates, the Aurora police chief, to the east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators are also quite a few questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a system of permits, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell -- before the target date of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead in most states in the regulations on marijuana, firstly on the therapeutic use exemptions and now with regard to personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, can not do more than suggest what works.
"No real precedent on which we base ourselves, he said.
The Law of Washington, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which leaves a vacuum of a year, during which the system of permits will be still, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain outstanding: how to balance the mandate of the rule that ensures appropriate access to marijuana and prohibits the installation of shops selling cannabis in a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or a nursery.
"will not be made more difficult places that urban areas to install a licensed trade sale of cannabis, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman of the Centre of the legalization of cannabis, a research group recently formed.
On 21 November, the head of the police, Oates, Aurora, has sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (prosecutor) would more people over the age of 21 who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop to charge people for this type of offence", with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said that the police would new judicial decisions which regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
At Weld County in northern Colorado, the district attorney" (the Prosecutor of the Republic) Ken Buck, embodies a vision more strict.
After the vote, he said that his office would handle cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on users for their addiction.
At the moment, 119 persons are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to initiate a prosecution against these people who have committed an offence who, at the time, was a recognized offence," said Mr Buck.
The reactions have been complicated even in rural areas as Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative in favor of the limited use of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer appear in adults for possession of limited amounts.
The representative of the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but has also decided not to classify without following all cases of possession of marijuana.
"I do not have the impression I was wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
While 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, provide a legal framework and appropriate government to personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"It is a cultural barrier" with the Department of Public Prosecutions, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and expressed as a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for the Reform of laws on marijuana).
"They spent a good part of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, have also struggled to accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to address the limited use of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, the Colorado and Washington state are becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and representatives of the State to provide a new frontier of legalized sales, they expect the guidelines with concern and the culture of the federal government, which still sees the sale of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope that the Department of Justice will.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has primarily commercial sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.
While it is true that the police will probably not push doors to small sachets of drugs, it was probably that it opposes the sale of marijuana for personal use to registered businesses authorized by new legislation," said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser of the Obama administration.
In many cities of the Colorado federal authorities did not act.
Even before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new businesses for sale of marijuana, even if it is that a delay of a year.
Last week, the town of Montrose has obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should ban next week.
"We do not want us in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
Our interest in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the State.
Many questions arise.

Petronella Wyatt: I've been bullied and excluded Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
Not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was a prominent place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times which stimulates the two pillars of civilization, tolerance and free thinking.
However, two weeks after I installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard newspaper has alleged that I left university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the bedroom next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson said with facetious I party after having been forced to drink in the chipped mugs.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of intimidation and made the subject of constant bullying.
Not because of my name rather heavy-handed, or due to the fact that I came from a private school.
I have been persecuted for a reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I have been the victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advice of Margaret Thatcher and I partisan of the Conservative Party.
Why mention this today, you might say.
And well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students undergo the same type of persecution.
The increased hatred and institutionalized Tory students to Oxford is such that the last week, some of them demanded a protection of their rights, the same as those of gays, of people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the Chamber of the Corpus Christi College students (CREB) declared that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt unwanted" because of their political opinions.
They want that there is a representative within the Committee of the university for the equality of opportunity so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, ITS and Right") devoted to politics among university students, and portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It discovered including student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", which moves in the Rolls-Royce, wears a full silver and travels with a cane to head the chrome.
In other universities, students, curators say, be treated as scapegoats of the introduction of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20 years, Vice-President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association," said to a Sunday newspaper that there was a growing left bias in universities.
People think that we as the Bullingdon Club without even we have encountered."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of OUCA, said that there was a deterioration of the attitude of the JCR in regard to persons who are members of the centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford.
I am coming in September 1986, I was the age of 18 years and a crippling shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was highly virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant to Margaret Thatcher -- a former student an honorary degree, because of the reduction in funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged of Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the week, when the new students acquainted with other teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen.
I discovered that the teachers were not only to sarcasm toward students Tory, but, they were fun.
It was as if the policy regarding juvenile strikers, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was a French translation of texts from the 18th century, and I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased)" please translate the first paragraph"
I have lost foot.
Pitt, a little man in the face of pustular, won easily.
"Is that the Thatchéristes refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
Other students laughed.
The tears me burning eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time, finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he said of a truculent tone.
I am back in my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that evening, I am sitting alone and then I felt a light slap on my shoulder.
It was a student in second grade English, named James, who presented himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, gently.
I fear so be it.
Any person suspected to be a Tory (Conservative) is targeted.
It is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it is even harder for you.
The majority of young Tory claim be Labor (Labor).
Later, at the local pub, I carelessly tried to hide myself.
I insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything that Mrs Thatcher had said.
This scheme has failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political science and economics that, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken up the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How the Tories are they love?" asked one of them.
They hurt each other, isn't it?"
I felt as homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Do I only could lead a normal life at Oxford?
Had I been forced to meet people sharing similar views only after dark?
I had become Labor and deny my views?
The three years would look like in a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only one professor openly Tory Norman Stone, professor of modern history, which was taught in my university.
He was detested not only because it was conservative, but also because it was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
It was almost never there.
He hated this insignificant and provincial location, as well as its accession to the point of view marxiste-déterministe history.
In 1997, he accepted a position of professor at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not happy here," he said.
I started to make the shuttle between Oxford and London home of my parents, finding refuge with my family and my friends more open-minded city dwellers.
I said to my father that I hated Oxford and explained why.
It was disbelief.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do it, not in the city of spires dreamers.
Even my friends communists had impeccable manners.
He had tears in their eyes.
Let them a chance.
I am sure that it is to tease you.
This break the heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance, progressively worsened.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and withdrew to its beliefs.
During a meeting of work the following week, when another history professor suggested seriously, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Rougissant internally of shame, I admitted to be the victim of the brainwashing of my parents and the traitai "old crazy."
The respite was short-lived.
It is my father who drove the final nail in my coffin oxfordien.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was locked.
I am still conjuring in my room, and after five minutes, my prosecutors have abandoned.
When they left, I packed my bag and I took the first train to London.
I am never returned.
You treat me chicken pleurnicharde.
But no child under 18 years of age should not be a victim of such intimidation in a school.
The tragedy is that it was Oxford, which not only produced first 14 Tory ministers, but also an unshakable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino prefers the elegance of reputation"
In the framework of the "Valentino: Master of Couture" exhibition, opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former home of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital fit to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer was recognized at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture," a prestigious retrospective which brings together more than 130 haute couture models established for its design house over the past 50 years.
"I love this house," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the centrepiece of a story which is the only player" he signore" lengths, but which could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the world and to share the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, from the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino expose memorabilia such as his trophies of upward social mobility: the modest designer of the town of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.
There are no wrong to love the kingship.
"At least, they do not crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpets as some stars of pop music," said Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receive with generosity and elegance.
"We adorions all be invited in his Gstaad chalet", says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friend of the beauties of the time as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance, prestige.
And even so, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, a model Valentino
The Argentine dummy, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at her apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr..
It saw and felt his spirit in every detail of her apartment, in the décor, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest feel important and valued", recalls the "top model", which has started to work with him during the week of haute couture in Paris in 1995.
"It never ends, because its creations are works of art," she says.
Parade of noble lineage
The lengths of life is not a history of obsessions but shared love.
He likes people very high and with more major titles and they also love.
A gallery of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium glamour of sixty meters wide which proposes exchanging roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and must scroll down on the podium to admire the "public" dream on key creations of Valentino, as the cutter that Jackie Kennedy had chosen the dress for her marriage with Aristotle Onassis, was Monica Vitti in "La Notte," or a jacket in wool and fur belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Of that audience of mannequins, include names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or the Habsburg Sophie.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of his clients say that first clothing Valentino are like first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"This is a gift that was done," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer his great love for femininity, to all other women, and because he was sublime our beauty," adds the ex-duchesse Feria.
I loved the colors he uses, they are light and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg, also can not forget the first time that she was a model Valentino.
When she was a teen and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening gowns ...
Finally, it was possible to the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a festival in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard Line.
It was a red evening gown, with a skirt to flying, draped necklines and a neckline.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of the Arenberg Rodrigue.
"Valentino is indifferent to the mode, he is obsessed by the timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess d'Arenberg retains the designer evening dresses with "the utmost care, because a gown is not just a dress, it is also all the memories associated with it."
The "king" of the way
The grand final of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller scope during her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer called his seamstresses) for this dress in ivory silk, twelve different kinds of lace, with pearl inlays and a lagging four metres and half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress is a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of high society clients."
Obnubilé for years by the "soft skills" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor in Italy) Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Legion of Honour, lengths has as many honors that any spouse of its clients.
"His refinement, its quiet, careful and perfect aspect I have always jumped eyes", recognizes the Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"It was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it is a princess who said ...

The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euro, holders of Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health with 70 kilograms of sulphur through the rugged stone paths.
Some people for whom the work is a hell and other working literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, a 400 juveniles who earn their living on the volcano's sulfur Kawah Ijen, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the earth to solidify on contact with air.
After harvesting of large rocks of sulphur, which weigh nearly 70 pounds in total, he moved in two bamboo baskets it on his shoulders through the rugged trails.
It has just 250 metres up to the top of the volcano that rises to 2.386 metres of altitude, but the exhausted porters are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, like a turtle, bearing in mind the balance and measuring their not not to trip and fall into the abyss.
They know that a mistake could cost them the life, as happened to a French tourist who took a fatal fall in Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The Ijen Kawah miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur extract.
Once at the top, there are emerging among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and painfully baskets, walking the 3 km until the balance that a mining company has installed a little below 850 metres.
These PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, arguably, its employees, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry as it is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture of cosmetics, candles, fireworks, dynamite and even used to launder the sugar.
"As we move about 70 kilograms, about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips per day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he exhausted, but it allows him to earn 138.000 rupees (EUR 11.50) at the end of the day.
Although it may seem to be a misery for a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (€ 167)," said the holder who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (€ 6.20) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto is income near his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, which for one reason, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that the sulphur: "I married a young girl of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced to Java for that she convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing difficulties, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gas.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already started to pay the bill although he covers the face with a mask and special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing difficulties, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gas emitted by the volcano.
That is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
"I will work for a further two years, because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French" he promises in a more acceptable English.
Malmené by this young, friendly and intelligent life could be a tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a mule.
It shares a hovel of substandard wood with other carriers, rises each day to two hours of the morning as the sulphur has not stopped up the night, when its characteristic yellow color is blue and shining in the darkness.
In the darkness, illuminating Anto descends in the crater with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, that it has bought itself with its own money.
Some 400 patients are baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company did not mechanized mining of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to carriers who are self-employed and are paid to weight.
In addition, they are not a subject of 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) that natural park guards charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not humans," protested Madrusin, a portly holder of 42 years who works at the Ijen Kawah for 30 years, since he left college.
Capable of up to 110 kilograms, it ensures that it will not work" as it can," because it is in need of money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here as the volcano is all my life.
While the sulphur damaging the throat and eye irritation when the tide is turning and trap miners in thick columns of smoke from the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complained of suffering serious illness ... plus, of course, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of baskets.
In balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, can only entrust 50 kilograms.
Each day, his companions and extract him 15 tonnes of sulphur of the volcano, three trucks carrying to the warehouse of Tamansari, to 18 km away by a trail of goats invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here as the volcano is all my life," says Unainik in opening the mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of five children, aged 30, also works as a holder of sulphur.
As time passes, but poverty perpetuates one of the most difficult crafts from generation to generation in the world: the human mules of the volcano are Kawah ljen.

Singapore research of babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are the responsibility of this absence of children on the career, the stress and the cost of access to the property.
"The population of Singapore needs to develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words are an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube to Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The lyrics from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put an open secret in the drawer" mocked the birth rate of Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency to the origin of the video, hopes to attract the attention on the problem in a fun way, thanks to that advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfil their national duty".
It is intended only to the Internet, we could make an entertaining and fun.
It is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of the birth rate, and we felt that it was a theme that we must address.
We knew that the government had tried several things as launch of pheromone perfume or organize evenings of speed-dating.
Many of these ideas were creative but they have not necessarily worked.
So we said the following thing: what more creative to solve this problem in a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take lightly.
It spends $300 US per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the Government in favor of marriage and fathers up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distribution of tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city-state rich and high technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national distribution of population, currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered as the rate of renewal, it was in 1976.
Why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, policy director of the marriage and the family of the National Division of the Population, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of objectives and priorities of life beyond the marriage and of family formation," she says.
These social changes have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, the result of a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy designed to drastically increase immigration to counter the decline of the population has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore found Web sites with a barely disguised xenophobia against immigrants, particularly toward the Chinese who are accused of pulling down wages and not to integrate.
The increase of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for which the party in Singapore last year its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the establishment of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Consequences inespérées
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, income tax, health costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences.
The government tries to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The authorities in urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known under the name of "shoe box", may be constructed in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square metres and their very successful sale.
However, authorities are concerned by the fact that they can promote a style of life and discourage developers seeking to build larger family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, said that its "shoe boxes" are much more quickly than larger houses.
They are more popular, in the sense where such housing is built much more quickly than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more cost-effective for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide better guidance to proponents, who was previously in the way if they wanted to offer too small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If both is that these new regulations may be a step towards the increase of the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it would appear that they did not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, as well as education, it is for this that people give to later," said a young executive.
The other people can have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says another young 20s.
The men and women mentioned their careers, the stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons to prevent them having children.
Thus, while the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, Singaporeans are themselves who have the last word.

What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private sphere or the area of private life that we can protect any intrusion".
What is which is in the private domain for 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in the daily life and on social networks?
Include the dangers facing them in the dissemination on the Internet of events that it would certainly not out of line?
The newspaper elPeriódico questioned five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web.
In four cases, they associate the term "something very personal" and "the password and user name "when they have applied to social networks.
"I do not going my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has an account over the past two years.
"This are highly classified secrets, my mother can know but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post of nice images or games.
I also discussed with my friends.
"I do not share one of my photos or of someone who would fool," he said.
The boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that it knows its 35 friends on FB as well as its nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority of the family.
Her mother, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to speak and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they meet me, I simply position," he added.
"The social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends, so fast," he said.
It argues that it never requested an unknown person.
It will not trust someone who recommend him a foreigner.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, it does not know 20 people listed on his list of friends.
"It didn't bother me because we have something in common, the music for example," he said.
According to the boy, nobody has made advances or not asked him his address or phone number.
"If they gave me the pressure or the required, I supprimerais simply my account," he says.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experience that it is today under the name of cyberstalking are not foreign to the boy.
A relative of one of my friends has been extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, José, has not closed its account.
"It has only happened in private profile".
It then explains a series of manipulations to configure its account safely.
At the difference of Jorge, this young posterait or embarrassing photos of knowledge in uncomfortable situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or upset.
"Even if I know that it is of cyberstalking," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and Licensee in Education and Learning, considers that, for children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras said Academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in pedagogy of Yale University and the author of the book "Native and digital immigrants", uses those words to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they, the children and young people who are born with the technology.
"We, we're the digital immigrants who must teach there, while we ourselves is learning," she said.
It adds that the issue is complex, "because we have a set on what is right or not disclose, publish or say to an age where they do not have the necessary maturity to do so".
"We ask them also to be selective when what matters to them most is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences."
According to the expert, the confidentiality of the most effective way to teach children and adolescents is to use questions that make you think.
"Tell them not to do so is useless," she says.
Secondly, Porras lists some examples: there are things that you do not telling to a foreigner, why are you doing on the Internet?
Or, would you like it they publish a photo of you as a friend that you published?
Do you what others publish on you?
When you identifies photos of celebrations, requests you to other persons permission to identify them?
And also, everyone needs to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Outside of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, and other principles of morality, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education consultant, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the conditions of use of social networks.
In each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation for discussing the implications of the opening of an account with their children on the Internet.
"For example, the age and that it is permitted to share or publish," he said.
The Guard, it is essential to remind children that he should not talk to strangers.

The summit of the Unasur ended without the Lima Declaration to be made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without that Lima Declaration had already been made public, although it has been previously announced and adopted by the present 7 agents.
Efe tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency have reported initially that he would be released after the summit, and then said that it would be published soon on the website of the Peruvian government.
When they were interviewed on the text, they reported that its content had been outlined by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The journalists ' access to information regarding the Summit has been limited.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential meeting with the message "audio small closed session," was published in the press room.
The little information circulating among journalists were those data by press officers of some Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of Peruvian spokesman.
The single document disclosed at the time of the day was the list of presidents, which has caused unease among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media were more important news.
Later, the presidency of Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not of the official document which has reached the summit.
Last October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd summit of Sud-Pays Arab (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been applied with trial by the press, it did not also circulated the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, can verify that the document was published in March.
In two international venues, Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the maximum information.
The summit was also found with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague that the border dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they respect the decision of the ICJ to hear submissions from the parties in the trial that Lima has brought against Santiago and which starts on Monday at The Hague.
"We respect and implement the verdict which resolve disputes that we today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, the peaceful resolution of the controversies, treaties and international tribunals", added the President Piñera in giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they submit to the ICJ took place after that Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua considered as seriously wrong.
The summit took place without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales of Bolivia, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
The suspended Paraguay, Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, was not.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The agent has to read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that lines of action of the 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of $17 million investment.
Among the agreements, it was mentioned that Unasur countries would place "important steps to achieving the goal of the South American citizenship by the development of agreements on the residence permit".
It was informed that action would be put in place to improve the cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, of actions for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess joint and effective way the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis," the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not be a triumphalist matrix but should help to increase our productive matrix and to a better future for our people", concluded the President Humala.
"We decided to focus a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of the areas of South America, in particular in rural and border areas ... in uniting our countries and in generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President during a speech.
Of these projects, it was mentioned that five were the Peru and on cross-cutting issues of its territory, from the coast of Brazil, and that two were a more important connection with Ecuador although it has not provided further details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will its reintegration within the Union of South American Nations", of which it is presently excluded.
The need that Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, and with good relations with its neighbors, is another theme at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not comprehensive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will seek to have a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to say to President Daniel Ortega that we resolve this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," said President Santos.

"South America Europe must learn how to incorporate a citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "the South America, in this case, should take the example on Europe".
The President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of Union of South American Nations (Unasur), based in Lima, said on state television, TV,, that the Europeans "were killed during the Second World War," and in other conflicts," but that they were now almost a homeland."
In this sense, it has defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by countries members of Unasur.
"to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any country in South America, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but it still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past" he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador was in favor of the replenishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective to reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and take into account the signatories of the Pact of San José on Human Rights.
Those who we banging ears never interfere, conversely, we, the South American, have all signed.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the granted political asylum by Ecuador in WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that it does not regret his decision, because it has not betrayed its principles, but it has met its "democratic values and human rights".
It concluded that at the time, "there are well-grounded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, the Swedish justice which demanded that it submit its territory to a questioning about an alleged sexual offence then that "the Swedish legislation allows it to do by videoconference, what could happen from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa has said that there was still a risk that the deteriorating mental and physical health of Assange.
"I have not spoken since that it is in our Embassy, but Ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said Ecuador's president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by being confined in a small space without power to exercise in the open air.
"This is on the health of anyone," he says.
Correa said that the solution of a grant of asylum to Assange since the month of June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the attribution of a safe conduct which it would visit the country, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and it emphasizes that it has had discussions in London to find a solution to the detention of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures from various European bodies," he said.
And he believes that "if Britain granted safe conduct as soon as tomorrow, it would."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation, and it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in Ecuador Embassy in London, or being interviewed via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.
Correa took to reaffirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said it was not that it was "the poor, the bad faith and lies which affect freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemy of freedom of the press are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists to the balance of the greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this context, it welcomed that it is not this kind of journalists" or bankers or bourgeois and hegemonic countries which dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than to his re-election," he would track and trace the path of the revolution to continue".
Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency "should stand firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup attempts in disguise", since in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
What is more, the president of Ecuador considers as "completely appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundary between the two countries by means of the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which enhance Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a country in South America and Central American countries.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together.
It must resolve them in their set to overtake them and move forward.
At the same time, it is confident in the successful resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime border between Peru and Chile in the same court and it said that it is "beneficial that Latin America up international forums if both countries agree to accept a judgment so strong it is."
In reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to seek a third consecutive term, he said he saw this opportunity" with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa has ascertained that, if he lost the primary in February 2013, it would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, the power has never interested me, but also unfair situations as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can not resolve by means of political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who did this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, this would be my last presidential term and I then withdraw from political life.
If we lose, I will also.
"This is my decision," he said.
Correa has also referred to new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, to Cuba.
I have just discussed with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This is not a relapse of the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended in an appeal to greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.

The AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the results of the test: HIV-positive.
"It is as if the sky had fallen on the head," he said in reference to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to "less onerous", in vain.
The young man hid in his family.
It has decided to take one of her illness and has started to inquire about her and his stubbornness was such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG) -- in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio resides with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubts, the stigma of treatment options, and more.
So, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided to say goodbye" because it was speechless."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people are still where the virus has already caused damage," exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory is now that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes as its reference point that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectious and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those consuming not drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4 count.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis to 25 years," as it remains under control, will live up to 75 years without problems," said the scientist interviewed.
To put this in context, you need to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is today 76 years on average.
While it is true that the mortality rate decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died as a result of AIDS from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS) but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients identified on the basis of national data are deceased.
Nothing that Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there, in 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
So why is there still deaths?
I think that the problem is not access to treatment.
It is like this that I see, it is what has happened in our hospital.
In the past 12 years at least, we have never failed, the problem is that patients arrive at a very advanced stage because they did not know they are infected, or when they learn at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact" nine in ten patients arrive when they are already an opportunistic infection, you need to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, it is to achieve more early diagnoses and, for this, we need suggestions of mass screening tests, to all those who apply."
The AIDS prevention specialists and members of the Council of State of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who was to test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he already was the holder of the AIDS and was suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is the common complication.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some believe that they will die and not know.
"If I'm going to die, it is better that I broke out three times a week," they say, this is not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, exercise, I take my medication.
To date, only parents know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life as anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I have an active sex life, but as I paid attention to me and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO for help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid now, during the march of the World Day against AIDS.
What do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will soon if they are HIV-positive and better, and if they have the diagnosis, he must know that we can live like everyone else, in being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
The condoms on the counter
It has many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the more lies in prevention.
In all sites dedicated to it," it actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now we give 100 packages, it is very well, but in the past, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections, found adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to?," asked sarcastically and value judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents did not want to hear, the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold counters, but found in public toilets distributors and in locations that youth frequent.
This does not encourage promiscuity.
It is not more of their pay girls and the motel, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded when asked if there is a distribution of condoms within its administration.
"This is not as sexuality, works best is to provide condoms to persons already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
It identifies 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 1.317 of HIV and AIDS).
The State is the fourth State of the countries in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of those infected with HIV.
92% of infections are through sex, blood 6% and 2% by the perinatal route.
An estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for each recorded cases, there are 4 or 5 persons who do not know.

A judgement ratified the appeal by a court in the United States ignores the restructuring of the debt of the group provided Vitro via a bankrupt business in Mexico. The scenario causes a harmful precedent for all National Societies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and with problems of solvency.
It seems therefore that survival procedures of Mexican companies authorized by the laws are not valid in the country to the stars, to the international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgement on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaving Mexican companies without the possibility of embargo defense of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will enable the main manufacturer of glass of Mexico to the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case said that creditors are required to register under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sitting in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would denounce the cooperation of the international procedure in case of insolvency of companies having a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law the Uniformity of the Law for International Trade had been established to this end by the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgement established that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, by debts of Vitro subsidiaries to the parent, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There by half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Swiss Federal Institute of Business Bankruptcies had guaranteed the debts.
In addition, what is certain is that, as the votes of subsidiaries in all ways Vitro creditors who fought against it in U.S. courts, i.e. "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, have not achieved the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes for and 37 against.
A given omitted by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that faced the United States, affecting the cost to the country.
For the moment, the society of the González family Sada appeal before the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, it is to say with five judges, because only three had voted.
The use of insurance will the non-prospérité and requires the review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro was detailed in the framework of the law on business bankruptcies, noting that the release of the conventions signed by the two countries for the same level as in paragraph 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
In addition, it noted that the country is folded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency proceedings, ensure equity for debtors and creditors.
Multi-vehicle of two parties: they overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country.
Overall assessment

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my life"
The globe-trotting basketball" Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the ground and, through him, has traveled around the world.
Few of the people of Puerto Rico to have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before that brain hemorrhage condemns the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, that this is as a player from the lower leagues, the national team of basketball player, manager and leader of the national team, the NSO, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the federation of basketball.
"I've worn several hats in the basketball throughout my life, and even more in the same time, as when I was President of OBS, Director General of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home to Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he made this assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated of photos and memories that remind its route out standards, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
In all his memories, he loved the most are those who remind him its passage as a player in the team of Vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"This has been my best years, those which I have the most because I had the chance to participate in eight championships of Vaqueros from 1967, as manager, co-manager or leader.
This is many years of satisfaction, including five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I am then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy is entered in the team of the NSO.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team," said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) told me: "I have a big player for you, it measures two metres.
You want to?"
It has happened that starting Mincy, one of the best players that had Puerto Rico.
Bartow was then recommended Raymond Gausse, who has been naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had permits to Bayamon win a championship, Gausse would help us to try to win another.
It welcomed the championship of Vaqueros with Gausse, but only to distance as in 1988 it was already the big brother of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its expenses and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 4th 1990 World, where we are and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had we not play the last game," said Reyes.
The team of the 1990 World is the best national team that you have to?
It is part of the best, like that which has beaten the Dream Team at the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we have put a beating to the United States team, which was quite similar to that which won bronze at the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) there was also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, León brothers Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not attend the World 90 due to a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement players suspended by the Pan American Games imbroglio of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, it is of Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played.
Who was the best leader Puerto Rico?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I like very much the work that Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
Be part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSO had up to 17 teams in a season.
What remains to be done?
There was things that I wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example that Ponce boys play only in their area and only national teams of other parts of the island during the play-off.
Today, young people traveling and play too much then that this is not necessarily required.
I at least have the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
This makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time I attend to basketball games.
And of course, I like the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been at my side.

Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21 1931, Forth Worth (Texas) is internationally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, better known under the name of J. R., in the television series "Dallas," in which he played a businessman without scruples, daunting and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, including the role of unscrupulous oil magnate J. R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He had 81 years.
Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J. R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications of cancer, according to a press release sent the family to The associated Press for Warner Bros., home production of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing ironic new role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him to Dallas in the holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and in the suite, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and it will greatly miss.
"This was an exceptional person and he lived life to the substantive," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver to Larry Hagman in 1992 and it had a lot to drink for many years.
In 1995, it had detected a malignant tumor in the liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman was known to the television in the role of a regular type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when it discovered a seductive engineering, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and that it had the back home.
He also played in two comedies that remained little time to the antenna," "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in film, are well received by the critical roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But this was thanks to his masterful interpretation of deliciously detestable J. R. Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama about the Ewing clan and their relatives has been aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J. R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character was nearly murdered, has generated speculation in the world and played millions of dollars in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record of the hearing at this time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average 41 million viewers were before their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had brought together 50 million viewers.
This was the J. R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J. R. that pregnant and had subsequently threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people were also reasons of the assault.
Hagman played Ewing role as a corrupt and insatiable human but charismatic smile: a dishonest contractor and a faithless husband who tried to detain his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what is needed as an epitaph for J. R," Hagman said in 1988.
On should write: "Military the honest citizen J. R. Ewing."
Here are the only party that he has lost.
Victoria Principal, the original series, recalled Hagman Friday as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have had the chance to know and love.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT.
The registration of five episodes is already completed for the second and a sixth season is underway, informed the chain.
For the moment, neither Warner nor the chain did not TNT on how the death of Hagman will be integrated in the series.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who was the celebrity with classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to attorney Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the stages of theaters of New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It is there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and that he was married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and has lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he has entitled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': The ruthless memories of J. R.)
"I have written in this book nothing that might hurt someone's feelings or affect in any way whatsoever," he said to the press at this time.
After his liver transplant, he became an activist of the organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to attend the patients concerned.
"I advised them, I give them confidence, I just with them when they come to operate and after," he said in 1996.
I try to give them a bit of comfort, such as "Be not afraid, it will not be easy for a small moment, but it will go well."
It has also been advocating against tobacco and took part in several campaigns.

A course on the "End of the world" has just begun
Each week, students explore the apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, the zombies, germs and viruses and global warming.
This six-month period, when religion professor Stuart Charmed decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was there an irresistible hook: the end of "countdown" of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, which many people as the proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmed had no idea of what awaited them in the coming months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal hole that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of the debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of the time thought that trigger the apocalypse.
"I am not realized that this was going to be the most apocalyptic half that I have ever known," said this week the Charmed professor to his students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If on analysis of what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we told, this was a very good period.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe the apocalypse.
And it is not the only professor to give courses this semester on "the end of the world", which will, in theory, the last of the story.
At Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker exemption" Media, Culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore the apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, the zombies, germs and viruses and global warming.
"We analyze it because those ideas grow with time," he said, and the manner in which they provide hypothetical scenarios some guide human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and explore how they can be compared with real life examples.
"I tried to tell my students on what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, the Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed to provide a course simply entitled "The end of the world".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to deliver the course again, in case the world disparaitrait not," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "disaster", students must study, develop projects and spending their final exams.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final review will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, which no other student choice to work "until the night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.
The course proved quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for students of high level, composed of 35 students.
We have received messages by electronic mail several weeks before the start of the semester, the part of the people who asked if there was room to grow.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are capable of comforting themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, originating from Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and Medical center of 25 years, stated that it viewed all apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students surveyed, and still less a teacher, said we believe in the world's end date of December 21.
"Our first project was the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited," said Julie zegle, final year student at Temple, aged 21 and originating from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I concede that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people react to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge of such speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people do not believe this," he says.
It is the majority in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle which gives the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that here were courses on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines are not the end of the world," nous-a replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, it has been referred to many expected dates of judgement, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will immediately begin to think the next date" or to philosophize on the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers took the day lightly.
Several told us that they go to parties" of the end of the world".
"Sometimes, I called friends and we rigolons together," said Samira Ford, student in communications of 20 years.
