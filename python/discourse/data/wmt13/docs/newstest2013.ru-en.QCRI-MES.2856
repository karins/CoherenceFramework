The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election
Republican leaders need to justify its policy in combating spin on the election.
However, in the centre of бреннана believe last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in the elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike.
In addition, the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these actions are partly discredit system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments since 2009, accept the laws, the registration or voting.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.
As a result, only one 2011 was 180 bills that restrict the right to vote in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of the presence of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, uprazdnyaut right on the day of the will of the voter registration and take away the right to vote of citizens with conviction.
Before the elections of 2006, no US state does not oblige voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana became the first state, which introduced such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in 2008, adopted in Indiana.
Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice and in other states.
During the last two years, they initiated bills, forcing voters to present a photo ID, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike the Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identity cards, as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e., the 21 million people who have reached the required for voting age, do not have identity cards with a photograph, issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceed 100 dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% African American, 15 percent of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18 percent of people older than 65 years and 20 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 years did not have the required ID cards with a photograph.
But that's not all.
The students - voters who are believed to be voting for candidates from Democrats in several states are not allowed to use a photo ID, issued their school.
But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs that voted mostly for Republicans, the use of the voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state has not demanded evidence of U.S. citizenship to vote.
It was the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Starting in 2011, more than a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures, apparently aimed to restrict the voting of immigrants from Latin America.
It is believed that two-thirds of Hispanic voters to vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011, the laws uprazdnyajošiem registration of voters on election day in eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction has not passed without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign has helped make the voter registration lists of about 10 million people.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall in the 17% of registering new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters, who voted early, were African Americans, although recent accounted for only 13 percent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened and with people from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24 percent of citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites who, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.
Of course, lawmakers Democrats and their supporters to actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several projects of the laws was vetirovano governors Democrats.
The most controversial laws was suspended by the intervention of the attorney general of the United States.
This has partly to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring charge identity card with a photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules in effect, of course, will make the implementation of the right to vote in the elections of 2012.
The criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them a clear direction to affect the outcome of the 2012 election in key states.
The report from the Center for бреннана from 2011 demonstrates that the United States, accepted these laws are necessary for 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these actions are partly discredit system of American democracy.

Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the test on the dog gives sometimes erroneous results, lzhenegative and sometimes lzhepositive that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
The men, and so reluctant to undergoing clinical examination, there is what hesitate even more.
To pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of the two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so it is difficult to interpret the data, and it is difficult to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the European, found different levels of mortality in patients who were screened and those who have not passed.
The study also showed that, after a 12-year-old observation that the probability of occurrence of metastasis by 30-40% higher than those who had not passed screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting in 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Are African American men are also at increased risk.
The key is making the right decisions, as soon as the cancer is detected.
The cancer can be as aggressive and вялотекущим.
Patients need to clarify the risk of cancer, offering him options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, and making choices, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many of the men who have detected cancer, will undergo a course of treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to life.
We will continue to offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we start treatment.
Increasingly, we have to define the criteria for making decisions about who should or should not pass the course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test. "
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to assess all the pros and cons of passing the test on the dog.
This document (as in English translation will be available in the near future) can be downloaded at: http: / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens-health / prostate-cancer-screening
To prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle-recipe, to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all the people were nice and quite moving, 30% of RACO cases could be prevented.
"if no one smoked, this figure rose to at least up to 50 percent," said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10 percent of the cases of cancer caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.
The Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many other.
It causes enormous damage to the health of the people.
"even today in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers," said Press Secretary Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging fact: ten years after refraining from smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight of
According to Carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and ovarian cancer.
"research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," he added to the association.
The food
The association also recommends that limit consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risks of cancer of the colon.
Should also avoid meat products.
Conservation of meat by smoked fish, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"the past can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explained in the association.
B vitamins
In recent years, many scientists were studying the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But for the moment, the results of these studies is not a single.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, while another gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not complete clarity.
But Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor.
"hiring the analysis does not lead to cancer."

The Higgs boson details
Last summer a message that scientists may be able to detect the Higgs boson, caused a real boom - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, much.
In addition, is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model, our best, or, at least, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, "but that previously could not detect experimentally.
But physics aren't yet sure what it is exactly about bozone Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that it strongly resembles boson Higgs, predicted the standard model.
In addition, new data presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, is confirmed, although for the full confidence of some of the data still lacks.
Imagine all the same, that we are talking about bozone Higgs, because the chances of mistaken seem minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world of one law is inevitable, recalls that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way around this rule, don't even try too hard, otherwise harm themselves.
But although the particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: Pauli exclusion principle, "which posits that the two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same" Elementary "is a" condition "is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, particle physics is divided into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermionami, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
In the other, scurrying around бозоны, stark Banda anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can be safe in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (by the way, is quite extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, these bosonы divided, in turn, into two groups: мезоны, about which we are here to say we won't, "particles and forces," which are the main force of nature, and that in some way relates boson Higgs.
These same бозоны, it should be stressed that not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal bozone: photonu, or "particle of light," which is a "courier" electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electrical charge, is accelerating or change direction, it "violates" electromagnetic field in this particular place, about how the stone in the pond.
From this "violations" born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV, etc.), and this wave is anything more than a photonom - and, therefore, one of the carriers "бозонов force."
More stable field
The same thing is happening with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that to this boson appeared to be "broken" another field, the Higgs field.
But the Higgs field is much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to his institute, the need to achieve a very, very high energies, as if it was on a frozen pond, the surface of which could move only very large stone.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated in CERN's Large Hadron Collider, a circle with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with electromagnetic field is also to explain the correlation between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles, and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact, have mass, while others (like photon, by the way), it does not have.
So, what "can do" all of these studies, asked Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to validate the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of their observations and forecasts.
In addition, some of them ardently yearn to such a discrepancy was found, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for a "New Physics" and silence some holes model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, not offering no explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which generates about 80% of the universe (ouch-ouch!).
But so far at CERN such disparities have not found.
The consequences of
Benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could even guess what the revolution will bring their work.
They foresaw their applications in science, but not more than that.
In fact, since the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where in 1960, was invented the laser, which he developed the first continuous laser (previous were импульсными) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine....
And besides, the application may be for instruments, accompanying the study.
For example, the same williard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small sensor light.
This sensor, though it wasn't his original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
This is, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.

Palliative care is the best way to die... | "debt."
The Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate will soon be resumed, but at this time is preparing a bill.
Yet in this important area, much remains to be done.
"the debt" attempted to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in monteregi.
The prostate cancer, razrushavshii inside him, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived for seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of palliative care Victor-gadboua in beløy where arrived the day before.
"but it's always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he says.
The disease does its job: incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet, and even to eat.
Sitting at the table, on which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that he helped to eat.
He bodritsya, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, lead it in the bath.
Courage in the face of normal death.
"my biggest wish is that I was cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this sickness.
"for the life teaches us that a man must urinate standing," said Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the runaway victor-gadboua.
Regress to the condition of the child - for some unbearable humiliation.
"it all depends on the ability of a person" live with the decline, "he argues.
Because, in the opinion of many people involved in palliative care, important events sluchayayutsya and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enroll in palliative shelter Victor-gadboua, all suffering from cancer.
Forecasts look to a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called "therapeutic."
Ms., 89 years old, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has enabled me to know their children.
"I have a good children," she adds.
"I don't want nothing more in life," she says, before being allowed to put her mask, relieving breathing.
She's still waiting in the coming days, the last visit his son, recruited from Italy.
In the runaway victor-gadboua with the help of a group of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with food.
This is the palliative care, which remains, when nothing more can be done.
In order to make the death more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11 700 residents have one seat in the institutions of palliative care.
This very little, given that sooner or later, we are all dead.
Here, life continues in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian мартель - one of the doctors shelter.
Whether it's the comfort of physical, emotional or soul.
Dying we agree to provide rotovye rinse of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks.
We are no longer impose diabetics control blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer, Mr. H., who died today at night.
On the morning of his son swilled down a beer in the legs of the deceased.
"we help families, as well as patients," said Natalie Savar, director of care.
In the runaway victor-gadboua may one day is not like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, situated on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and pereprobovasij everything to survive.
"in the last six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," said Dr. Christian мартель concerned.
53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor-gadboua, come out of the house, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to care, which is available to ease the suffering of patients who had entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home or in the hospital or in the orphanage.
And some institutions, such as the shelter Victor-gadboua and society of palliative care at home of Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.
This is the big gap in the health care system Quebec makes many doctors, specialists in palliative care fear the adoption of the law, legalizingyuschego assisted death and assistance in suicide.
Since October circulates manifesto, signed by beacons in palliative care, Dr. balfur mount and Dr. Bernard lyapuant and verifying their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to Dr Christian мартель, Quebec's health-care system is effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care quality before they will be allowed to move to euthanasia.
Recently, "she says," I saw the patient, who has spent 14 days in the department of emergency, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to ease.
I'm afraid that patients are willing to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of the Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she replied that he regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.
At the same time, she herself told me that my days are numbered!
No all-powerful care
Dr. мартель believes that 90 percent of the patients who asked about death, thanking medical personnel, for what they have not fulfilled their request, after a team of palliative care eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not omnipotent in dealing with the pain.
According to Alcee Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to the anaesthetic in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or permanently.
Can't even pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Sick, suffering from pain, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I wish I had a presumption," which means "I want to make it easier for me."
The establishment of this report was made possible thanks to a grant from the journalistic Research Institute of Health Canada.

Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fundraisers for political parties and the Italian mafia day after day to tell what they know about the colossal "system," oputyvayuschey construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and the Mafia.
"the industry," which is very costly to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"it's curious how this system breaks down after they were put on the case all funds, joked Jacques ducheno, MP and former police chief Montreal."
It is thanks to him in 2011, the scandal as a product of the investigation into the misconduct related to road-building contracts in Quebec, in which the prime minister at the time of the liberals, Jean ball, very reluctantly agreed.
"the report ducheno" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, the Ministry of Transport would have kept only one billion dollars in contracts," if some withheld their instincts to take part.
"the Commission has already shifted sharboni two mayors," he added, hoping that she could "open the scheme behind individuals."
The permanent division to fight corruption, created in 2011.
In the case of подключилось created in 2011, the permanent division to fight corruption, which included extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, members of the special unit "hammer" that after the 2009 forced "stochny cartel" Montreal, stop the overvaluation of the value of the contracts.
Over the past weeks has conducted a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular the franc website and Richar marcott - the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
The line - Gilles wayyancour, recently retired from the post of mayor lavala, the third-largest city in the province of Quebec.
He was suspected of receiving bribes neodnocratnom when using government contracts.
In addition, the indictment was charged with several engineers service railways Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter detonated a bomb, after the investigation of the "system" of obtaining government contracts.
Within a few years Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts, in Montreal, some intermediary, linked to the mafia, which, in turn, to translate the money party mayor geralda Trembley "joint Montreal."
In the 2000 "s Zambito soril money right and left. He listed more than 88 million Canadian dollars (about 68 million euros) to the various parties in the province, mostly liberals who came back in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Nathalie Normando.
Sewer contracts, in which the victors altered the
In Montreal, "system" corruption worked without a hitch.
Gilles surprenan, a former engineer for civil construction, described in detail her before the commission: in the ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, to the golf tournaments, in restaurants, on the hockey matches and bribes in a total of 736 million dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that were, zavyshaya account for 30-40% with the help of fake additions.
Then one organizer of the Party mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Trembley that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of the parallel budget, napolnyavshego party ticket dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trembley resigned in early November, plunging the Montreal in deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal, zabivshih anxiety.
The mayor of Riviere-de-preri district in the east of the island, she is opposed to the 2010 sale of municipal area, purchased for $5 million and pereprodannogo... for 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of the dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which eventually will be launched, it "pulls the plug, allowing to understand the functioning of the system, infested ants to stop gangrenu and identify the perpetrators."
This process she characteresaet as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but the city will need its own investigation team and observer, to avoid the return of questionable practices.
As we ubiraemsya at home.
Regularly. "
Jacques ducheno notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he was especially concerned about the role of the elected officials who knew about this scheme, "but was not involved in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign finance in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec offers a limit of up to $100 donations to parties, but, he said, it will not change the situation: "as long as we are not going to strictly limit political spending, in politics are dirty money."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing of political parties: "we cannot fall below; boldly into the details of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."
If this story and tarnish the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. ducheno urges those who laughs, look in your own backyard....

"Paris St Germain - not FC Barcelona!"
This season you're in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual conscience, but can - and a new dimension of Paris St Germain.
Of the great players.
Next to them I'm growing every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football everything is happening very quickly.
But I'm not raspaliaius.
From the beginning, in the center of the preliminary preparation in the NIF in clerfontain and prior to my arrival in Saint-Etienne I always strode forward.
Thus, you will benefit from the competition, Carlo Ancelotti....
Topping this summer is not a novelty to play matches a very high level.
They also know that every training session is very important.
This leads to the fact that such a player like me, wants to be at the level and the place to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my position.
He helps substitutes such as Claude makelel, who played in the same position that I have.
Ancelotti is the owner of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect all the technical staff.
Today, in the first league he has no equal, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with the top clubs.
He worked with great players. "
I think he will bring new titles of Paris.
In January, I had with him was reassuring conversation.
Then I moved from a series of injuries.
The trust, which he has, also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season, PSG?
In the first league leader Lyon took the place.
But we are still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we are spectacularly qualify in one-eighth finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, all can be.
We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to accept the return match in one-eighth finals.
Paris St Germain will become the first European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and consolidate its position in the long term.
Today, it is not so.
Financially from Paris St Germain have the means to make the project viable.
Not to take the title in the first league, as last season, will be the biggest failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are valid ardently wish to win the league title.
Last season we were to this close.
In May, it was a disappointment, because we had everything to come to finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think, will be all right.
Despite the fact that in the fight for the title have such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much has been invested and what we have players.
We are fully ready for this.
On the other hand, when we chose home 4-0 against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder, what to do in the first place people expect from us.
We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed with time.
We have proven in the Champions League, that we can respond to the modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who already has two season fails to pass the one-eighth finals, although they also spent a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, we were 15 points ahead of the winter time failing.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and to the Championship in France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new Paris St Germain.
This shows how compelling the first league.
I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, we won.
Paris St Germain, it seems, depends entirely on the feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So what if they say that there is a "zlatanozavisimost."
It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he has scored a lot of goals.
He came to this, and he proves that he is the star of the first league.
Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround it.
What he did, it's really exclusively.
It stimulates and others to improve his game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
How do you survived the Euro-2012 with France?
As disappointment.
I ardently wished to participate in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time.
I've seen there many things, and I came out stronger.
Today I was able to play a good qualifier matches.
This is what I hoped for since my baptism in blue.
We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave well.
What do you think of the first months of Didier deshama led blue?
They for him successful.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not want to compare.
Blanc has reached its goal, he qualified the US into the euro.
I hope that Didier desham lead Blue in Brazil.
Good deserved the draw (1-1), вырванная October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match has given us confidence in themselves.
Each fought for all.
Before the shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.

Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current currency exchange, based on центробанках, numbered transactions between parties from receiving commission fees on their treatment.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure exchange of the BitTorrent protocol, which allows for the exchange of files between members of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with the 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites take bitkoyny for donations or as a means of payment.
The course bitkoyna, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before returning today about ten dollars (courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes as "the most successful bitcoyne virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, as "loans" used to advance in a video game, which made during the game, or who may buy (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook also has developed a similar system.
But the operation is always exchange controls and processes any central authority.
In bitcoyne all nodes network are simultaneously holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers exchange, poccupatelymi and vendors.
How this network?
Each transaction between two users actually happens between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
The only payment for each new user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information relating to this deal, signed by electronically, using encryption system with a double switch.
The network also can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, you might check that bitkoyny used in the transaction, really exist in the public accounts book, razoslanary across the network.
A key step is the registration of new transaction in this book.
She passes through the decision of mathematical tasks, razoslanary computers, decided that, if temporary, the central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.
It is a phase of hashing file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in the digital signature, short and unique.
"computers take" a new transaction and add to her room, before "хэшировать" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros in early).
As soon as this number is found, other sites are easy to check that it properly.
Transaction thus turns nerarzryvno associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the purpose of deceiving the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) wished to pay twice the topic of the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer, decided the task, gets 50 bitkoinov.
To avoid inflation, the award regularly is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitkoinov in circulation so limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until one stomillional that leaves still reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
Life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Web sites that provide services Bitcoin, were attacked, and bitkoyny were stolen from the reserves.
"used defect does not apply to the protocol," said Pierre noise, who recently launched paymium - company payments accomplishing real money using Bitcoin network.
The ECB also said about the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But the money also have this disadvantage.
The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as blogging platform WordPress, their resolve.
Recently, Adi Shamir and дорит Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounts book and found that nearly 80% bitkoinov are not in circulation.
"giant sales" were announced in November.
"thirty-thousand dollars were exchanged," glad Jon Holmquist, working in coinabul, which deals with the conversion bitkoinov into gold.
Pierre noise, another author of the benefits for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contact-less payment via mobile phone, but she uses to verify the Bitcoin transactions, thus getting cheaper.
The owner of better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just tell the address, which can be "photograph and recognize" phone, says Pierre noise, worry, because he has already thousands of users.
There is a general trend to revise the hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.
"before the Bitcoin fixed, it will take some time, but the 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests that, by the way, to review the various risks, considered today elevated, in the case of the success of this system.

We have gone from Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (каписа and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only in the US.
The US suffered mostly Afghan farmers, which we are viewed as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and pokalechennymi.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as it was in the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their own traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are suffering, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer, as soon as the West will behave more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from bases Nijrab, which I watched from a Hill plantation almond trees thanks to French credit, took place in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked.
By the end of 2014, invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions.
Taking them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women have paid for obscurantism these farmers, in which their outdid al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved, and in our days.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in the position of dependence.
The main characters in the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned to dealers, exciting public lands to resell them under construction immigrants, returning from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts subcontracts.
They have discredited; most of them, by the way, even themselves not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that was not one of the thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave those who managed to American generosity: significant outflow of capital.
The young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world while in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages.
About 65 percent of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities are filled, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who don't want to go back to the old mrakobesion parties, no to corruption of some leaders.
Everything, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment, the Army is.
Government, which will be to her commander, will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders, ведшие anti-Soviet struggle, is already taking measures to restore provincial militias who would not abide by the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences, should be up to a certain extent decentralizovan, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections, scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put back on its feet, none of the dam does not function, no irrigation system is not repaired.
All imported; nothing is done, except for vegetables and fruits.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control over infrastructure would be needed.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has a vast mineral wealth.
This only added to the impression that Western countries were present there, only to their boss.
Without the energy for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot, without means of transportation to their export through the mountains, no mining.
The Chinese already almost left the Aynak copper deposit months, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and remain the biggest employers in the province.
It is also necessary to one day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
A new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls, for boys, faculty of the French language at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win the hearts and minds" and do the impossible task of combining with the assistance of offensive operations, "civil-military activities" at the Ministry of Defence (cimic), was abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with heavy involvement of local labor force, could help stem the insurgency: irrigation, Wells, drinking water, restoring forests, fruit trees, protection of soils and an increase in the area of arable land.
What we leave the memory of himself, having spent two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget impact would improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests on the implementation of the small agricultural work, emanating from local communities in Kapisa.
To get rid of uprisings, led by foreign groups, which want farmers, as I said, we need to provide them with a small military support, which would be good superivised and came to him directly.

Egypt's constitution heavy labor
It is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play all-Bank.
Outposts all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.
Exactly one week ago, the head of the state Assembly has two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "violate this word" and "to flout the law."
In the camp of his followers believe that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
In a very short period of time, which makes the brothers to abandon plans to explain to Egyptians text, article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi, seems to have convinced the Egyptians vote positively, as he said in an interview with the US weekly time.
Moreover, the call for accelerated voting like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people, "or you vote for my text, or I leave the emergency powers," which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Majority of the liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling is not in a position to convey their views.
The representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same thing.
To make the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the brothers and Muslims.
It is no wonder that in most cases, the articles were progolosovana unanimously.
Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few differences emerged around the day... time for prayers, as some members of the committee decided that the hours of the constituent assembly were improperly configured.
The text, which was yesterday's vote, consists of 234 articles.
The object of the spotlight, Article 2 eventually remained the same article of the constitution of 1971, that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafi party, for whom the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main demands, hoped to replace the "principles" of the "rules" that would give them more rigorous application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy," "meet the liberals who see in this a PR.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the constitution is going through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which gives the University of al-Azhar advisory role, particularly with regard to verify compliance with Sharia law.
According to the expert on Egypt Sophie Pomi, this is worrisome, etc. "people to make decisions that are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the emergence of theocracy. "
Many liberals, moreover, excited by the fact that the next chancellor of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.
"at the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil rights.
Most of the lawyers who worked on the text, "it's not the ulama, people with a university education, some were trained in the French system" - calms Alexis blo, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "around the Article 220 may ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence," Ed.].
And in the future may be wondering how civilian judges competent to decide about this. "
In addition to their religious aspect, the text, adopted yesterday, criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the Republic.
Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they have significantly decreased compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held not in parliament, and the National Council of defense.
Also will not be denied the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from the Association for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be detrimental for freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth prohibited insult that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles are no longer speaks for the protection of women, emphasizes chaeba moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word that does not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak yesterday evening on television, and protests are planned today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"the Great and Powerful" to Moscow over: migrants save money for language
While lawmakers and human rights activists argue that will give the law on compulsory language testing, in a country already emerged fraudsters selling fake certificates. "
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come 13 million migrant workers.
For the most part, the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support their families, remaining at home.
The law came into effect on December 1, under which each migrant will be obliged to take the test on the knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service industry, housing and utilities, life and retail trade.
But over time, "the promise of the Federal Migration Service," the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Though it will take not only the language, but also in Russian history, and the basic law.
Knowledge of the language will have to verify and to see, and to extend a work permit.
The exception is only for the citizens of those countries where English is the official language.
Do not fall under the law and the people who get успевшие certificates and diplomas on education before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The benefits, doomed and protection of the rights of
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language of Pushkin, peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, University and other Russian universities.
Migrants would be able to pass the tests in all cities; now in Russia opened more than 160 such centers.
The initiative supported by the introduction of testing and deputies of the State Duma, and foundations.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into effect, many times in the press had to ask the question: what it is, in fact, will give?
That will change that knowledge of the language and for the Russians, and for the visitors?
First of all, is to meet representatives of the migration service, "this will reduce the number of people suffering from" labor slavery. "
Very many say now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of Russia's Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan Victor sebelev.
The protection of their rights should begin before their departure.
The system will allow only organized set a 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems appear from migrant workers without jobs, education, not knowing the language, do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, "said sebelev - future migrant is doomed to face unfair people who, under the guise of helping him" putyovka vsunut "in a terribly close Barack, where he and dozens like him will languish for months without food and documents, вкалывая on 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"at home they promise one thing and on arrival they cheated, select passports, failed to pay promised salary," confirms the head of the main department of labor migration Ms Tajikistan толиб Sharipov.
Not rugaisha, nasyalnika!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, recognised that not only did not know the language of the country, in which seek, but also on their own and then write with difficulty.
Of course, it's not their fault, how much trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even describing primary education.
After all, their families can't even feed the children, not to mention that got them to dress, shoes and снаряжать in school.
Dorastaya until adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity to go to work.
It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of the language, "they confess.
"you feel humiliated and incomplete."
However, in respect of the law on the language of human rights activists say one important point.
The testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the same status no - there will be no test, no further official work.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"welcome, or outsiders no entrance."
Many of the newcomers say that gain official status in our country is not so simple.
The reason is the bureaucratic barriers and all the same language difficulties.
Moreover, the legalization of costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Here's a false registration can be done quickly and just one and a half thousand.
The Russian police officers know that we mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"asking for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he shared with journalists a citizen of Tajikistan oumed hushkadamov.
"налетай, not скупись, buy painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language revealed that there are not only мигрантские false documents for registration.
Several of the "sham" certificates of a language tests have already been seized by the FMS.
Fake paper printed on a color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, brigands hoping thus to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
It is twice as expensive procedures of official testing: it will cost Labour migrant in three thousand.
The fact that the main challenge in the near future "to protect the system of corruption, to" orange "was not simply buy, converge and representatives of the authorities, and human rights activists.
In the meantime, authorities can promise guest workers who are unable to successfully undergo testing for the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, the newcomers, did not know Russian, will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.

The Interior Ministry does not take on a turnover of illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legal weapons of extremely small
Russia's Interior Ministry proposes to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities on the recent incidents: press shots at weddings, when no victims, and the massacre by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which the press killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing traumatics in public places and to raise the age from which you can get a license for the weapon - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and anti-corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that the amendments to the law on weapons in the Duma will in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws."
The network has an open letter, the authors of the rifle - representatives of various public organizations - require to abandon the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons minimal, said Russian-language service of the BBC lawyer-suite Vasily forest rangers.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, for six months of 2012 142 crimes committed with firearms, registered in the bodies of internal affairs, while the total for the same period registered regularities of thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter assured that the tightening legislation in the sphere of civil weapons not puts the offender to go on "black" market.
Now, they said, in Moscow, you can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior said that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
"the black market weapons is replenished on several channels.
Major such channels five, said a retired Colonel Victor Baranets, ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the army.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first is "the army or military footprint" that is a weapon that had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"weapons dragged and Russian officers, and Caucasians," says Baranets.
This kind of "black weapons" - stolen by criminals from the members of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes and spirited from police warehouses, and stolen from directly to law enforcement officials.
Illegal "baggage" go on sale from military warehouses.
The many military warehouses were frequent explosions.
"there is a proven version of that part of the arson were made specifically to cover the shortage," said former military.
Its contribution, in the words of Baranec, making weapons manufacturers.
"now divorced private gun factories, which do not withstand competition in the international market and thrown weapons from under the floor on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of "black" market - smuggling.
Especially many comes pistols and rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"there are their production, sometimes primitive, and formed the mafia, which organized the flow," explains the former military.
The weapons?
Experts thought, what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.
In 2011, the report prepared by the Center for analysis and the troubled state-management project.
Experts analyzed the statements of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Rosstat, criminologicheskaya literature and open data portals on the weapons issue.
The main part of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there "at the hands of the officials, whose work is connected with weapons," according to the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of armed conflicts, at 14 percent of cases occur theft in the stage production of weapons, 5% fall on "Black archaeology."
The seller-consultant of one of gun shops, who asked not to be identified by his surname, insists that the weapons, found black copateliais, has long been nobody buys is too old.
Most often, as he says, the new party sellers go on a military warehouse.
The Ensign man buys unit, for example, pistol.
He was discharged her, pass through the fence.
"he carries it in the city and it sells for $900 euros a share with two shops," he says
"the truth is that the police in the course of all cases, so periodically when Burns plan for solving crimes, conducts secret purchases from merchants illegal weapons," added the consultant.
"as in the luxury store."
The seller and the buyer is often find each other through acquaintances.
I peeped on Web sites, blogs, have not yet responded comrade, who offered to come to the platform "racing," where is the man who Romeo me in the "corner" where we will bargain.
The price of a barrel I learned only there
Columnist Victor Baranets military
I need to get the barrel of a familiar, there is a way out, "says the seller-consultant." I have a friend there, but I'm not sure.
Sellers in the markets, but there is also a need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that she is a daughter of tooth fell."
I am now even a couple of кастетов достаю through a person, which I am sure.
He also their supplies only to me, because I know that I don't rent.
Newcomers looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried himself in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.
The scheme, he said, have not changed.
He gave the album with photographs, where there was "anything."
"I felt like in a luxury store," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranec, does not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.
I, a potential customer, not just buy - we are going with the seller in the forest, there's set target.
"I was given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon is hitting well, begin to negotiate," he describes the procedure expert.
Shop on the couch
Search engines in the Internet posting on the Web sites and groups in VKontakte, where the offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
To do this, do not need any documents and personal meetings.
"it is enough to have a certain amount of money," he wrote in the advertising cap on the site "buy a gun battle or machine."
The users leave their applications and asking questions.
But minors sell?
"without a license, of course," he asks the user "Ivan" (sic) retained.
"buy" - tt.moskva tersely formulates the request "fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service now razbrosila a huge network of fake sites and wanting to buy martial weapons rowing by shovel.
People go, how hungry fish on prykormku, and then coal mined in Siberia
Military analyst and former military Victor Baranets
I heard about such schemes: usually site registered outside the actions of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through an ATM produces payment.
"in response, send a photo and instruction, where hidden weapons," said the press secretary of the public organization "right to weapons," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets argues that leaving the application on the site, you can stay without weapons and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service now razbrosila a huge network of fake sites and wanting to buy martial weapons rowing by shovel.
"people go, like a hungry fish on prykormku, and then coal mined in Siberia," he argues.
Makarov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, can meet in the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry kislova of the organization, "the right to weapons," Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
Will have to wait a month and a half.
He shipped from warehouses long-term storage management of these warehouses middle managers.
According to the official stastistice departments, compared with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole of Russia fell by 7% and accounted for 22.9 million, and the number of diagnosed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8 percent.

In the U.S. fast food and supermarket workers strike
Through the work at hand, "McDonald's" goes up to a quarter of all American teens
In recent days of America, the wave of protests against low wages in department stores Corporation Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, "" tacos Bell, "" Wendys "and" Kentucky Fraid chicken. "
So far, no one is predicting that will turn the tide in the ninth shaft or her destined to expire in the early stages.
Shares in support of labor unions and a number of left-wing organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries, which receive rank-and-file employees of Walmart and a system of fast food, protest organisers aim is the creation of the trade union organizations.
So far this sector of the economy almost not covered union movement.
46 cents in the year?
Stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America has fallen orgy of cheap sales, annexed by millions of average citizens and sometimes accompanied потасовками.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, in which around the world work 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists Stores Corporation, whose product is designed for people of modest and middle-class.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Why many wage employees of Walmart come only at work.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap, partly because few pay their workers.
The latter also complained of the tough conditions, such as a shortage of trucks or hand-held scanners.
The participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
Typical employee Walmart, to supress 9.5 dollars per hour, this expense not afford, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will raise salaries to Armenia to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the company at 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.
If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, every visit to the store will do them all to 46 cents more expensive.
For the year, they will spend on some 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of the Walmart rather noted that the protests have occurred only in nine states and did not cause any damage maleyshchego Corporation.
"black Friday," continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of its cash registers produced in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
Company spokesman Dan Fogelman left the site claimed in an interview with The Huffington Post that jobs out of a total of "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was just a "gimmick" another deadline-slaughtering its union.
"free tickets!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore there is no), McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even give you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!
Jumein Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants with time it improves, but only slightly, and the average of their rank-and-file workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
Fewer of them in this expensive city not earning one.
How can you live in New York for the money is incomprehensible to me.
Once through McDonald's took place almost a quarter of American teens who podrabatyvali for their mystery after school, living with their parents.
Few people saw it as a main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I happen upon interviews with workers "macdonaldsov" who complain that they have to live on the salary and sometimes even to feed her children.
On the other hand, the Forum newspaper, the Wall Street Journal hangs a comment, the author of the notes that irresponsible to have children, if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The participants of the protest, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the fast-food cooks and cashiers system began to pay a minimum of $15 per hour, have more than doubled their current minimum salary.
They also demanded that the fast food in the area were established trade union organizations.
U.S. law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement придирками and layoffs.
On the other hand, Bush rarely makes them to life.
But cover Union fast food is difficult, and for obvious reasons.
One of the main - unusual turnover.
The dissenters
Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the event was in the middle of the Day rally at the McDonald's near Times Square, which was organized by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council jumein Williams, declared: "McDonald," says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even give you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!. "
The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill de Blasio, declared that "we must join together in support of fast-food workers so that they have achieved a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every New York yorkets!."
As described what happened to the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food industry.
But it took only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, which in New York are employed tens of thousands of people.
While it is unclear whether this will produce sparks the flame of the mass movement.

"as long as the fool the brain is secondary."
Popular among fans of modern technology theme augmented reality lately taken to perceive primarily through the prism of special glasses.
The first summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that an application for a patent filed and Microsoft.
But the conversation with the head of a group of interactive 3D technology laboratory in cambridzhsk Microsoft Sharam Izadi follows that for scientists this company points - passed.
Their beckons the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
"please tell us, please, in general terms, what does your team?
"we are engaged in human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, the mass of humanity stuck on the stage of the pixels on a flat screen, sometimes тыканья finger at them.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Xbox Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox Kinect today without not sold, because all the interesting vestovoe management.
"that still awaits us ahead?
"despite the fact that the Kinect suffered interaction on a physical level, much still going on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of improved information system (gets more data), and the conclusion is not very.
We are trying to change this, working on a true 3D display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projective.
Need to release the computer world in our, physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell with these stupid helmets virtual reality!
"what do you think about the voice control?
The popular thing, but not overestimate it?
"it certainly is not a panacea - question privacy, because you don't always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places we had a project, in which we thought over gestures, but not over the swinging, and over such parsimonious, short.
The gestures were not camera devices, and naręcznym bracelet, which registered movement of the bones and muscles.
While he is big, but in theory it could be reduced to the size of a wrist watches.
But in general, the future of the mixed type of management, for example, gesture + voice.
"it's like?
"for example, how can you ask me to give you this bank carbonated drinks?
You say, and at the show.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- that is, you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not at the moment the machine?
"not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future, we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that allow more accurately determine the reaction of the person.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
"if you talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, which you claim to modern cameras?
Not enough permission, depth or something?
"in principle, the current generation is something from which we can build in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it is good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1,000 to / from.
But it is not the megapixelons themselves, as well as the matrix and depth.
The last point of view of all current technology is not good enough for us - it adds to the work of the designers algorithms.
That is, we need to remember not only about a resolution on axes X, Y, and z.
It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
The movement of the person quite dynamic, and current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen betishes from our redmondsk laboratory did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index.
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between humans and machines.
In my work, I would be very useful in the equivalent of such a device, not only requires kasanions to frames per second was more.
"and to increase the number of cameras don't need?
"now there are three" Kinect camera, "one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second - receiver reflected signal.
But it is already the third luggage is, in fact, the usual sensor visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem....
Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of payments.
It would be nice to create a flexible equivalent of Kinect, play with the curvature of cameras and see how it will help in determining the three provisions.
"as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public his glasses.
You don't think that from the point of view of day-to-day use technology augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
"of course, all the time slob, holding a smartphone in the raised hands, not very comfortable, but here's what I think: the steep option would be" restricted "keeps the reality, when on the basis of the cloud platform you could switch with points on a smartphone, the projection screen and then everywhere.
Points are very personal device, in that their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time weakness is supplemented by the reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on the virtual objects, together with other people.
"imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only Tony Stark from" Iron Man, "but also an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem, which often pointed criticism of such ideas: no tactile feedback.
Hands didn't feel!
What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?
- in his lectures I often say that amended the reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could well become a supplement of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks - the use of second hand as a kind of a background for the image.
She is perfectly registers clicking!
But there are technologies that are really focused on making this "pictures in the air," Mama - for example, electron beams ultrasound several aimed at a certain point, where the finger, gives a sense of, but it is very weak - as if you're blowing on pads.
There are bracelets on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers are also promising direction.
"and you were trying to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something?
"this is a good idea, we haven't tried to do so.
Here is another challenge, which will have to fight for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in a very limited space, believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - work and on the concepts of cross-country trails (not such as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as the huge balloons.
Fool the brain until it turns medium, work is still very for many years.
That's what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive to researcher - many things in absolutely infancy.

Instead of culture - rosbalt.r minor complaints
"Rosbalt" continues to project "Petersburg avant-garde," dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
At the top of the list of prominent figures have already entered the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are beyond the scope of the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing Russian fame.
A new hero, "rosbalta" Pentagram artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in red, which meets the Russian Museum, Summer Garden, at the fort and vernissages fashion.
Pictures of Cyril Miller always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they exhibited.
Cyril Miller is one of the most purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical сказочников, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a bright man crusade in St. Petersburg in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets calling smile from citizens, the resonance the mood.
He recently took anything in the hands and became St. Petersburg sharmanshchikom, as ripe for this complex role of all its богемным existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, and why do you still go through the city in the red, and not in the yellow and turquoise, for example?
"I chose the red color as a fashion designer, whose views and image.
In this world of red color is a compromise between the artist, the maker and society.
Although the society all that is slightly not gray, causes aggression and excitement malign properties.
But my provocations aimed at ensuring that began the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions - an invitation to debate.
"and when you realized that must be an artist?
"the exhibition in DC Nevsky, where they were displayed my work.
I realized that this is my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists took place, and the new, free like me were unclear.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with postgaznevschina, which led to the "Pushkin-10," and more waves.
I was thrown in the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except for the words.
"and all this merged in your art-clinic..." it was important to find yourself in the middle of the culture of St. Petersburg, where the need to gather all the best creative force.
In 1995, I took the territory on Pushkin-10, and there has not been repairs, there was a musical and artistic, bohemian Club, home of the St. Petersburg Bohemia.
Many there were born: nomy, tequila-jazz, I remember the string led with the project, "Van Gogh's ear.
Cord and his friends sang under the veneer light songs, they were in obtyagivayuschem tights, among them was a fashionable now composer Igor vdovin.
When the band played live, she became the "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was leading many programs to Khali-galivskikh times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and went to his great career, and basic education and upbringing he had received.
Gallery, "Dr 137," club "Griboedov is echoes from the art-clinic.
To our employees and patrons were gone.
Yesterday I hero of the century, when the culture is something mean.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "the people of our city."
In the category of "Artist of the year" was named, I ended my peak.
In the New Times under the old rules uncomfortable work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years easily become popular, but the culture and popularity are separated, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
"your work is characterized by recognizable manner.
"many of my paintings - it hits, they clearly expressed the urgency and poignancy.
I will be software exhibition, "the Russian Museum in clownah."
Clowns - timeless category.
I used social was now to be so is a painful and scary.
But in all clownah smeared, shooting tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have гротесковые ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian dressing наказово.
Now meet on clothes, depending on foreign mechanics, and not on the inner man.
And, perhaps, his hand to it and give birth to spit.
And deception will be removed with the help of dressing.
"but recently we saw you in the role of the urban шарманщика. - cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, like me, they have to be.
"well, can and commercial art can be beautiful?
"now the commercial art should be careful and considerate, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people crowded into the pack, eat one loved, простаки more.
Now, all crashed on microsoobshchestva, now it is hard to enjoy everything.
I'm not стодолларовая paper, so that everybody likes.
Now need to think, who will be like.
Now each of the cult hero of 100 fans.
"but the Stas Mihaylov comes to several thousand!
"on him come brochenki there sexo-social sphere works.
But the cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10,000 didn't come, and as a result fewer management, money, everything dies.
I have fans, the main thing is they don't cheat, don't spoil their possessions.
I'm in the youth wrote such paintings that one collector they on the wall next to the Falc and Larionov hung.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Now often confused notions.
They say: the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew by examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing paintings.
I am for such a culture.
- Cyril, which lacks the Petersburg?
"good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: an official from the culture.
But not every one of them can do culture.
When all was not right tsars, Kings, maybe not quite understand the culture, but they understand that you need to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow now good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg, which could be the experts, but they are closed, as are higher experts who correctly appreciate these experts and give them the way.
Now thrives vkusovshchinka.
The same Erarta, but their distinguishes what they honestly say that not all modern art we accept that there are some artists who should seek to other museums.
"what is good for you - St. Petersburg?
"St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow culture is much more, where the soil is.
But on our stones art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural soil, and we writers now more than readers, it is wrong.
Here in Europe, a lot of people who go on lyubopytstvujuchyh. exhibitions, concerts.
We do this layer of subtle.
We need to make a fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented on the grant of St. Petersburg

To give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with the asteroid-killer.
The caravans землянами aboard ships to go in search of a spare the planet.
To save humanity, raises the question of how to continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact, only two of these planets that you can develop at least hypothetically.
"it's Venus and Mars," said senior researcher of the National Astronomical Institute, P.K. Sternberg (presently) Vladimir surdin.
But if conditions on Mars is more suitable for life, on the surface of Venus - the temperature to 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
A half-century ago conducted experiments on the plants.
Four generations of grown in orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then, focusing on the orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies, fruit flies.
In 1979, the eggs перепелок sent into space to check how the developing embryo in conditions of weightlessness.
We get on the output is absolutely normal chick.
And then begins the problem.
"the problem with the fact that this nestling must find a support, he should get back on their feet and start moving," explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of medical and biological problems (imbp) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir sychev.
Not finding support, chicks randomly rolled around.
But after 10 hours in newborns was full of atrophy instincts.
The chicks not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"and the two times we vyluplyali chicks, after it refused, because it is simply impossible there to work with them," says the failure of an experiment with Birds in Space Vladimir sychev.
With animals last time biological "minikovcheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
But the biosputnik "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
It was an experiment with mice, which sent into space, already with fruit.
In principle, there is not found nothing unusual.
"it's just been on biosputnikah, but again, this is a single experiment, and such research should be done," said Vladimir sychev.
After landing at the space of rats appeared offspring.
But the approach to the problem of duplication directly in space until it happens.
Easy task.
The animals, losing, customary habitat, simply can't realize their sexual instinct.
The man, unlike зверюшек, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens possesses the abstract thinking, and to create an opportune emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are not.
But the women in space travel is already 50 years.
The biggest risk was the Tereshkova.
But the most precious, that there is a humanity, is a woman's body.
Our Seagull flew, and no one on earth could not say whether he will continue after the flight into space.
Whether she will give birth to a child after this flight.
"because this question no one answered," says veteran rocket-space industry Vakhtang vachnadz.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child andriyan Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana savitsk, twice the orbit and even поработавшей in outer space, the son was born.
However, the risk remains.
We have a little, there are few astronauts, who after long flights all cost, and is growing at a healthy generation.
"and if more, then it is dangerous even in the orbital flights," summarizes cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity.
CPC гидролаборатория - mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in the neutral buoyancy astronauts spend skills to work in outer space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
If the water for adults, let and comfortable, but still alien environment, for infants - native element.
Small ichthyandra seems to confirm - life on land emerged from the ocean.
There is a link between what the kid is about 9 months from her mother in okoplodnaya liquid, then it is easier to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, runs in just two weeks.
"this is a very little to do something to forget," says instructor grudnichkovogo diving Marina aksyonova.
In other words, if a child born weightlessness more natural state, for women - the necessary gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness dryachleyut muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, the ability to expel the fetus.
Oh well, redesign and it is relying on stimulants generic activities.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go into labor, she will bump him.
"and then what?" asks trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity.
With no sense of gravity, the body does not form the skeleton and muscle system.
The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, put in a special load costume for training.
He simply will be deprived of that he will be essential.
"and this experiment, in which we are with you go, assuming the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to what we bring to the ground disability, fully disadaptirovannogo person," he predicts, head of the Committee on bioethics imbp Ras Igor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, it will be a reality, when the Earth on their ships go on a faraway planet, which will become home to their descendants, born in space.

The head of the unregistered management: checking Schwartz-system failed at the hands of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good body control and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lags behind in its implementation.
This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Security Audit Department, from the interview for the site aktualně.cz.
"the law will never be perfect, but it must be properly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough," said the current situation of Kala.
Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.
As an example of improper practices cited Peter nechasa approach to the so-called Schwartz-system.
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - is it is banned or permitted?
"the law should be established in any way, and if it is something that bans, and the Prime Minister could not resist the work of agencies, who are required to verify and to seek fulfillment of obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies, you are talking about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which was compared legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was it?
A parallel investigation that we began, perhaps, two years ago.
Simply put, the talk that European law says, how should receive government procurement, then it should be national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All the information was collected and, even if still unfinished verification, revealed some interesting differences - simply put, legislation we can be a "clear and unmistakable," but in practice we have in some respects behind Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, you need to focus on the application of the law.
But exactly how this project can help you, that he is mean to you?
That is the kind of joint control can contribute in efforts to stop clarify laws, reduce and improve the restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economy means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always) low price to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will reach, lowering the limit orders.
Perhaps, this system переполнится "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the limit is not declined.
You're talking about the internal problems of the practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
But as a functioning system of control in Germany?
There is such an organization as our KRU (control-revisional management) or it works differently?
As for the institutions, then there as our Kru is the bundesrechnungshof, arranged according to our principle, there is also a board, which operates a bit differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the authority to a certain extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a division of the audit and the level of federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from ours.
Brh could manage only federal money, we have a public funds.
The public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the federal registration chambers.
As for the local laws, there is easier than us?
In general, I would not want to compare without concrete evidence, but in some respects Germany can take a sample, but we can't say definitely that it is better for everyone.
This is so, because they are better able to cope with control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But I have to say that even the main countries faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?
If we talk about the domestic legislation, as reflected in your facility amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences?
Given that the legal validity of these amendments are quite short, it still doesn't manifested itself in our work to control.
So how we control over the fact that it is necessary to take into account some delay.
Take this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we have to use our new tools "risk uneconomnosti detection," through which we turned away nearly 14,000 state contracts. "we analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will emerge, because change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and, I hope, is confirmed.
The problem, which may arise, is that the rules "uzhestochatsya" and it will be impossible to observe.
The functioning of the previous rules controlled enterprises are related to the supplier (for example, Regional Operational programs - with the regional council) that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.
In this case, whether to tighten the law in this way?
I think that is not in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit formal mistake, not influencing the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let's recognize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the prime minister said that GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs audits of the so-called Schwartz-system. "what does this mean?
"Schwartz-system" is banned or permitted?
The law should be established in any way, and if it is something that bans, and the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the authorities, who are required to verify and to seek fulfillment of obligations.
You can say: "we will change the law and allow it," but you can't say that we'll pretend as if nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement contains very strict rules, and that must formally held, and it is the right thing. It protects public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only because of technical problems.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough.

Shimon ornest: at the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that less than a month should come the end of the world?
This is just one of the many disturbing news, on which we, the people, so easily popadaemsya.
Together with a group of the tap tap we constantly kidding on this subject and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three shows at the end of the world.
Could you tell more about this readers?
It is a national event to raise funds, which we are planning for a period of two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has the Mayan calendar, which declared the end of December 21, at 11: 10.
The day before the event, 20 December at 21: 00 parallel start three concert in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, the time zone which for 12 hours earlier than the US, will end May calendar.
Who came into my head this idea?
Initially, it was my idea, then we are all up together with our artist gonz Augusta.
Besides that, we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to work together with the public to think about the state of the world we will pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of May the calendar we have created a unique collection of items from the shoes, shirts, bags and original ключиков against Doomsday. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz, and thereby also provide us support.
Group of the tap tap along with other musicians also sang the national anthem at the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."
Whether listeners already favorite YouTube anthem on these бенефисных concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end all the work and the end of the world will not come.
His запоют all performers on all concerts at the same time.
The same anthems ring also live on Czech television.
The words to this song written and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomas ганак, participates in the performance also xindl X...
As you have started to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other boys Czech cultural life, because we have a lot of charitable events and concerts.
Actively try to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interesting.
The proceeds from the concert will go against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for bezbarriernogo educational center studeo, now in its sixth year, we will work with civil association edlichki tap at the Institute.
Teachers regularly attend schools and students of the Institute of edlichki spend with them funny and interesting events.
The students themselves do not have the resources to go to the teachers, and so we try to give them the opportunity.
In the framework of the additional construction institute edlichki in the future, there will be a separate building, in which we moved to this project.
At each concert will perform several musical groups and performers.
What were the criteria for selection?
We tried to draw up a program that interested in all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chinaski, support lesbiens, illustratosphere with Dan Bart, the Tap Tap, Marjan банго and Jiri Sukhi.
About all the details can be found on the site www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan to any such "grandiose events" in the future?
In May, will for the first time to perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, to prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, so if we in the United States, I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
Group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with expensive in terms of organisation and logistics???
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five players on the electric wheelchairs and strollers must travel in the cargo area, plus a large amount of cargo and boxes with instruments.
Nevertheless, until done with that, without problems. Czech Airlines ČSA British Airlines and British Airways have always been well prepared for us that surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to the выездам abroad you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes toward the disabled and so on.
With what you encountered to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where everything works better than we have, in Russia, we have seen that in the East is still on a basic level.
Compared with the Prague in Moscow so many barriers, and here is still in the Bieszczady independent movement of a man in a electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also there in the course of such banal things like give way disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there already are having a social organizations, who are trying to draw people's attention on the problems of people with disabilities.
In what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance which is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the development and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it regards.
In London and Madrid is quite normal that people with severe disabilities to move on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, yes anywhere...
There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, and in this we tap tap them with the slightly ahead!
The respect of the public or bezbarriereness is one thing, but at the moment, when among us will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really start to change.
While this is a single cases - people with a strong will.
A group of the tap tap at the present time is very popular, but back two years ago that in 1998 you caused her to organize?
I entered the institute edlichki as a teacher, I had a lot of young people who wanted something to do.
And because I am a musician and play the saxophone, along with a colleague organized an interesting music circle.
Well, but over time, says our leading Ladia angelovich, it is a bit out of control (laughs).
The popularity of the same came only in the last few years, or I have something steps?
It is true, we helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively working on advocacy group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, essentially as if it does not exist.
Due to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Whether you stood in front of the goal so well turn the tap tap?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In the show-biz is full of things, podrazhayuschey one another.
This is logical, all new taken with caution, and lasts that long.
There is very little rare things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, a pity, it is natural...
But this is absolutely izlishnya pity, because people with disabilities are not suffering any and all abandoned personalities, which we should pity.
They are the people who can live a full life and, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities, it turns out, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole of society.
Lee ensured the success that you are a strong leader, how many of you think?
If we want to do the job properly, we should be in many things intransigent and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that it is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion and fly in the clouds, and when you know that twice a week they must go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it happens in any group that wants to work and to accomplish something.
At the present time as part of the tap tap twenty people.
How many of them were in the early in 1998?
Only one Ladia angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and the will power, our doors are always open.
He will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.
The concert will be held at the stadium in Prague Incheba, in Brno and Ostrava fléda - the club is in the centre of plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert all three cities joined телемостом songs at the time of the execution of the tap tap "the end of the world is cancelled."
The goal of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional bezbarriernogo equipment for educational center studeo edlichki at the Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert is worth 400 kroner, for children under 12 years of free entrance. Tickets can be bought in advance in bohemiaticket.

Poland and the space.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years took an active part in a number of projects agency.
But the path to the space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the second world war, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it's not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, about the lectures and. Sternfeldâ that December 6, 1933, represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "introduction to космонавтику."
The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Yang gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, won the prize in France Sternfeld Robert esno-peltrated and Andre Luiz hirsca for "introduction to космонавтику."
Dr. Yang gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space exploration.
He published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to this scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky propagandist space became known to the world, and his contribution was estimated, including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway drezina, equipped with missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not clear, even to disperse or for braking carts was supposed to be used rocket.
Information about this drezina known only from the newspapers of the era.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to worry about the missile стрелах.
A study conducted in cooperation with the weapons technology section professors mieczyslav wolfk and Gustav mokzhitsky.
Of the remaining material shows that research has reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops work were interrupted.
In 1937 in the specialized press appeared idea фотоэлектрической missiles and fighter, which offered engineer rogozinsky, and the following year was the work of "air rocket-powered aircraft and rocket-and-bomb" author Leliv-kzhivoblotskogo.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war all projects military use of missile technology was a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), which coordinated the work.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of work by the end of the start of the war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo astronautyczne).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of the Journal of 1954, "problems," in which four-dimensional published articles on Astronautical.
In one of them, Professor M. subotovich offered to organize a society that will be cosmonauticals.
At the time, already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.
Since the start of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (ooa) attempted to join the International Federation Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in autumn ooa became its member.
But the next year, the first chairman of ooa Kazimierz zarankevich (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
From 1956 ooa contributed to the development of the highly successful meteorological rockets RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, vpolnivshei scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
A rocket capable of overcoming the distance 1800 m, was about 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 pounds.
Subsequently, was built enhanced version of RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on vacant bledovsk were conducted tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do this scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the rise in the wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
Heiress RM became the first missile type missile meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.
The rocket was conceived as a stage, its total length was 51 cm, and initial weight - 32.5 kg.
The company has developed three types of (marked as a meteor-1A, -1v and -1s), which varied in size camera for scientific equipment.
Missile meteor-1A had space with 0.4 liters, meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and meteor-1C - 0,62l.
The maximum range from all three types of was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 years in the Aviation Institute was the development of a missile meteor-2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Missile meteor-2 with a weight of 380 kg was able to bring valuable cargo weighing 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then were built version of the meteor-2n and meteor-3.
We should also mention the accession of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, and the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, in the framework of the intercosmos program, Poland participated in studies of outer space for the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav germashevsky became the second intercosmonautom after Vladimir ремека.

The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The decision provoked a lively debate in society.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that a separate economic units, national economies, are in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, no limited movement of private capital, along with untamed financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labor (wage) raises the price pressure.
Under this concept, you need to understand the condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to weather the economic competition, the "value" is pushing competitor to pick up a larger share of the market and, therefore, increase their own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those in countries where labor costs, compared with other, high.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, including and made them unemployment, rising inevitable government spending on social needs.
In general, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of the gentlemen of employers to pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that don't need to give specific statistics.
Besceremona methods of private capital to create economies at the level of individual states situation, when governments are forced to engage in competition with each other in order to artificially reduce social level of its population, with the aim of attracting foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments of their own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected in the changes to the current legislation.
The goal is to make its economically Aquapark Aquapark people to obey the dictates of private capital, primarily in the areas of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor laws.
As a result of the rising level of poverty, and at the same time, and the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves their own labor.
The number of these people are already approaching one million.
In the framework of improving the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occur cases when employed people receive a salary that the state should mention them, so they have a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public, and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same end, in which people who are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or live in poverty-level wages on the margins of society in the hope that someday in the country will come to a private investment capital.
But the question is, where he will undertake?
If the funds will come from other EU countries, poverty is to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, an Egyptian, African still works for the share of wages.
This for all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere in the actions of the managers of the economy.
Then the question to be answered is whether private capital, now practically managing policy and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes?
The answer is a definite yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, emerging in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department because of a lack of financial resources electrical design bills to private law firms, which are closely related to the industry.
Then these bills approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution, and from the financial-powerful groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly turns in such an aquapark Aquapark situation, as described Appian at work, "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "the state has long breaks, and agencies are responsible for the violence.
Bribes, illegally obtaining no favours with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went into the election with a pre-sold voice... "" decent people never ran for the post of governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without consul "...." seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is an autocracy and the necessity of choosing an energetic person.. "Appian thought that it would be a Pompey, but they became Caesar, who had replaced democracy and autocracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without regard for the public interest.
Private capital is already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.
Now the result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character.
That means the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless economic liberalization of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy such as can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected the next round.
Above all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we are now witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition on both the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is the target of political and social reforms that will strengthen the fractional state involvement in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.

Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"the violence will not do, and can never go out," the Sting, "fragile," where the main verse рефрена are the words: "don't forget what we are fragile."
"if my sons don't want war, they would not be" - a moribund goutelle Schnaper, wife Meer amshela Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has caused a lot of responses.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position that he has the right to self-defense, but Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of killings is a criminal and who is the victim, in the end, today's Israeli citizens, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not been seen at the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, look at who primarily serve continues for 95 years of tension (apart from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning supported by historical facts, some of them are taken on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people are taking their own steps, or for their throne was someone who guided their actions to a pre-set goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and arising out of them, the authorities could not for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be seen as the head of the octopus (don't know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
A lot of them don't write.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the '90s of the 19th century, to stop the rumors, linking their name with criminal actions in the higher spheres, in the shade of which they were, and that always led to consolidate their power, the attainment of wealth or both, and to another.
They are large stakes in almost all central banks around the world, and against the countries whose central banks do not have its share, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only seven countries, after the invasion of Iraq was the 5 countries, after the overthrow of the Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has assumed a central bank of the country in their own hands.
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for rothschildowski Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to produce their own (ponymay) - government money and was assassinated in 1865, in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in 1859, the year 1871 led to the development of the plan three world wars, created by the great Mason 33 level-Albert Pike.
The first task of the war has been the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially in the UK, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (of so many slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be other than as a precondition for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power.
The method, which works with the help of a group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order AB Chao - order out of chaos.
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the base of the Fed, which would prevent a recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to untie the first world war, by the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne габсбургского Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the tsarist Russia, starting Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, posts and economically untenable in the surrender of Germany (there was no need for a war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing Central European powers, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the launching of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing a huge war reparations Germany than created a precondition to the radicalization of impoverished masses, then the Germans had only given strong enough, oblicayuschego perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational alight with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, fueling the fire of war.
In the late 19th century Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the history of the Jews with Jerusalem as its capital, the return to Zion).
Above the Balfour Declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to happen the first clash with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler extricated himself from the chains, in which he was initially kept the bankers, or anything that he did, it was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was triggered by the military reparations on the first world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed, in order to create a nest of war by a third.
If international bankers to manage its start, the Jewish people, and in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos, not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take just a sharp divide people on the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspirations for a world power?
Here we need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like the US, international bankers подсовывают people to vote in the elections for their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to the international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and taking control of Iran over the latter chokepoint containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), "also will lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In light of the now are the words, said David Rockefeller in 1994: "all we need is a total crisis, and people will accept the new world order."
The new world order in their view is the World Masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy, naslajdayuscheisha comfort.
A world where everyone born body at birth implanting chip, with whom he becomes a, which is under total control.
"and it makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slave have on the right hand or forehead on stigma, so that people who are not marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.
That is the wisdom: everyone who has a mind, can calculate the number of the beast.
Because it is the name of the human, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.

The film "operation" Argo ": when the worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, demonstrators seized a crowd of Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were supposed to be freed in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which have been the patron of his regime for decades.
The US administration for a positive outcome of the situation is not productive - she could not afford to throw overboard Shah, because it is fundamentally could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
But to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not in the state.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoners diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the government of Algeria.
Their fate has triggered a wave of solidarity and antiiranski sentiment.
Defeat in Iran has largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election-year ended September election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, srezhessirovanny actor Ben Affleck, "Argo" describes the operation as "one of the episodes of history that has brought America small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of six workers managed to escape.
After some serious troubles they finished their way into the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, the extravagant legend helped cover, according to which they rode on Canadian passports as members of the crew, podyskivavshie in place for the filming of science-fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert on "evacuation" Tony Mendez, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
The legend was true, in specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, was to hold a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time held in secret, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The film аффлека is a special blend of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film-kinoopus," the story of a successful venture, scam - example could be a series of films about friends оушена.
In the film are constantly changing moods - on the one hand, the documentary conceived scenes from Tehran (in a caption shown significant historical photographs of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the movie "big differences in this no).
On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, overlapping with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits are discussing the situation at the tables of negotiations on the stairways institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleck рестарт remarkably managed to make a career.
From vysmeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"operation" Argo, "his third feature film, after dark detective" farewell, baby, Goodbye "(2007) and the thriller" The Town "(2010).
At the same time, this is the first film аффлека, who has not appeared in the hometown of director - Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place that belongs to the qualities that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is shown in "Argo," where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and непредвиденности that arise when it suddenly changed history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes of fictional (fake headquarters in the Tehran Bazaar).
Far too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative suggests many exciting scenes of cinematic values.
He has been working successfully with this little, sometimes something further elaborated - there's all this goes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America, to prevent the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and Chase on the landing strip look pretty farfetched).
Lack of "Argo" is a distraction, associated with the need to show there are too many things in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of a Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters deserve to have more space, and they are not alone in the film.
Film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, this film, which you can watch with moderate interest, in assessing the performance and retro-style, recreating nature of the Seventies.
But captures with difficulty.
However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated notions about the Almighty and vseznayuchyh security services.

The rules inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, performing the annual survey of the most absurd banking fees, now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd judgment or project from the workshop of the EU."
"we made the last event, in which the EU plans to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," he said, "the law," organizer Patrick Nager questionnaire.
Among the charges on the nomination absurdities - the recent decision by the European court of unification of the premium rates for men and women.
So far, the women have benefits for life insurance, because insurance companies they objectively are less prone to risk.
"further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can nominate the competition until the end of this year.
The vote will be held before the end of February 2013, "said Nager.
The EU's controversial orders include, for example, and mandatory fuel Rekreacji Sp, adding that as a result of the harmful nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury gradusnikov only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances directive or the size of the cages for chickens, eggs rose significantly this year.
Also criticized was subjected to a de facto ban on the use of the term "buterbrodnoye butter" or withdrawal from the sale of traditional light bulbs.
High-quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in length.
Pan-European aid often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels is usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even threatened veto defends the demands of their banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, bananas are of the highest quality in the EU were supposed to reach 14 cm in length and doesn't dare show "unusual curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission is justified by the fact that only harmonizes existing piecemeal national rules that are complicating trade.
The EU, despite resistance from some member states, yet softened standards concerning the fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to rastochenia products.
The winning candidate in the poll may become and last year's decision by the EU, according to which sold balloons must contain a warning that children under eight years can't finagle their without adult supervision.
The EU has asked the American research, in accordance with which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death by suffocation.
That restriction now applies to children up to 14 years, which is prohibited blow in the trade fair dudelki.
Funny ideas are born and at home
Enough is absurd and rule on the European officials: anyone who has the EU any official position, can not, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, the use of the name Macedonia, and should instead talk "FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "the principle of noninterference" ("laissez faire), offered to vote, in addition to several above absurd rules, for example, usually the EU about the amount of food stocks in the territory of the membership of the state.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks, which can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic than, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a big fine.
Organizers of the questionnaire is also interested in some countries and the idea of paying for what they don't have sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the statement about getting subsidies.
But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.
"we are in an uncomfortable position, because we don't have the sea.
Ask the European Union for compensation, "he said in the fall of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As the argument, he pointed out that the country was high grain yield, and as a result of the so-called intervention buying state had full warehouses stocks, which had to be taken.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to паласу, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, arranging a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages, the Ministry of Regional Development, extradited minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: bizarre orders are the exception
Although the resolution in member states can easily become the target of critics, the efforts of the EU on regulation, as well as more effective functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A major problem, according to experts, is cherpanie EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved when discussing the budget.
Evokes emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians retained the name "olomoucki curds," but "tuzemsky rum," tradition in our country, which has its roots in the 19th century, our producers have to rename the "thusemak."
Called the rum can only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beets.
The official list of registered products to the EU, along with the world-famous "feta cheese" and "gorgondzola," marcipanom from German Luebeck or Parma ham, has already proved, for example, Karlovy Vary breadcrumbs, pogorzelitsky and teresebonsky carp and jatetsky hops.
The trademark of the EU can be proud pardubitsky carrots and gorrzyckie tubes.

People want me to guarded Republic, but I'm a fan, "said окамура.
Mr. senator, as a man comes to mind to run for president?
I don't think about that to become a senator or president.
If we in the country all functioned without problems, then I'm not running.
But I can't see how over the past 20 years the country разворовывается, as thieves scurrying around here, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be a politician..
But when I see something that I don't like, then try to find a solution, as it change.
And since I was four years old and I am an independent man, not belonging to any party, I don't have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of senator or president.
In the Senate, you were, but soon went to the presidential palace.
Whether you are thus not turn back to the people that you choose?
I always said that vklyuchus in the struggle for the presidential palace, depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate.
Later, I said that if I am elected senator, will run for the presidency.
My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can carry out their views.
So I need to have the greatest influence and vast powers.
But the problem is not only that we as a nation have ropschem himself in a bar or on TV, but are willing to trample anyone who tries to change something.
Added to the media that person ochernyayut, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, I was told that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri paroubeka.
Go to your views.
The struggle for the presidential Castle you started with a thesis about the material and criminal liability of politicians and on the back of property declarations on the amount above 20 million.
To this, it is necessary to change the law.
You do not have such powers as president, and only a Senate may propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbying to conduct tours became free enterprise, it managed to advance.
The problem is playing politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal to the left or right, he deliberately thwarted, and it deters citizens.
As an independent bespartisanogo person I have a much greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I have no party raskladyvaniya through, without regard to the tenets of each party can take what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or to the left?
The Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to the left.
For me it doesn't matter - a little bit to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it is important that we go forward.
It is not that someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I always support any good for society, or whether it will offer the hrcm GFC, and I'm just going against bad ideas.
You're angry, when someone says that you are populist.
But does not prove whether you are what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some good goals and views.
And for that you are trying to get closer.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals, about which I say, already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say.
But without the support of the parliament will remain only slogans.
And with that in politics you don't hold on.
Or do you think that when you get to the people and talk to them, you will be able to realize the criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other opportunities.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to entice them on their side, so that we have achieved his.
If I was elected president, then it would not be a problem to organise a live television broadcast, in which I will appeal to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legitimize the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in the case of refusal, will have to inform, why didn't want.
If there is a strong personality, which makes the abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was due to pressure from the public.
Say directly that I'm a lover, not a genius and not intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I am only a novice in politics, and for its programs will try to get the support of the majority.
Things I'm trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails to finish in six years and return to the private sector.
This is partly sounds as if окамура should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no longer the Savior.
I know that one I didn't do, so I visited a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to radzim yanchur, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.
Also I at least supported a leading investigative journalist Jan lorentsov, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil.
I put forward his candidacy because people and really dissatisfied, but now I feel myself on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to choose members of the establishment.
Us independent in the Senate, only two.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for your views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the basis of their own party?
I haven't thought about it, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past each potential supporter, and I don't have the money.
There is no money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property declarations, but what about your own affairs with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague at a cost of about 25 million, the apartment on a 10 million, another apartment at 8 million, the collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million and Skoda SupHerb per million, and even a few million on the account.
Incidentally Aston-Martin for me, because it was my malchishechya dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was a gallant with women and at the same time, fought against the meanness and lawlessness.
You travel to Aston-Martin, own property on the 60 million and you don't have the money to the campaign?
You say that you want to change the country, but particularly in this to invest their own money does not want.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have a 15-million on the campaign.
I have to climb into debt?
The campaign, I have already invested 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign out of pocket.
Spending on the campaign I essentially will cover senatorskaya salary.
But on this money, I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for the English School, which is worth 30,000 monthly.
If I wanted to just make money, so there would not be nominated.
So, the next you'll be doing business in order to live?
Don't you say that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the paycheck.
As I promised, I partially reduced its activities.
For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like, that I was bessrebrennikom, which will keep the Republic.
But I also need to something to live.
How much, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive monthly?
Between 200 and 400 thousand that get and further.
But if I became president, his business would be finished.

The architects MVRDV argue that these adventures are not only in the imagination - for example спейкениссе and his newly built book Mountains -- 2 photos
"to me it seems fun, it looks футуристично, finally we once again you can see something interesting," said Lizette verkhaig, prokhojaya on the edge of the road.
But Stefan spermon, an expert on it at the nearby large company, said: "no, it really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we today, another library?
All have access to the Internet, the iPad and e-books.
Now nobody voluntarily do not go to such old-fashioned library, right?
Спейкениссе, maloprimechatelnomu balconomu campus in Rotterdam, belongs to the unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To deal with this unfortunate circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro notes, in the form of richly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers understood that they remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library here!
Blame Maas from Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold столбчатых diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, take to the task with his usual unflappable and appeared on the competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and grin on his face.
And while the members of the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, sassy Maas folded from his original gift pyramidku in size and completed it in defense of his project with the words: "dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "book Mountain" in спейкениссе, the so-called bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain of $30 million euros grew.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes the underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several nearby houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, "the book Mountain" was awarded second prize in the contest "the best library of the Netherlands 2012."
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition wooden structures of 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, who could not suggest anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly homely town hall, the white facades which suggest a molokozavod, became richer than the one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important thing is the спейкениссе appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural facilities.
The long road to book
The first impression: repetition of Eldorado under Egypt for cheese.
There is only one elevator, held in the center of the mountain range, because the real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.
Ostecklenno from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, floors of bricks and elegant street lamps unerringly creates a sense of public town square.
The urban environment is recreated.
View unwittingly looking benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"usually the bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is a dark room, usually a comfortless and faceless," says blame Maas.
We have set the classic configuration of space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out.
Inner space book mountains used skillfully: in the center of the offices, online library, chess club, ecological center and technical facilities.
Particularly pleasing black bookshelves that serve that cover the walls, then парапетами, лестничными railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell of unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and engineers lost in the roadway, what is the unknown material.
"we are eager to work with secondary materials," explains Joop trauborst, head of the project, representing community спейкениссе, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining the roots used artificial fibrous material millimeter thickness.
It is a cheap and saves time.
Thin textile serves a one-two of the season, after that he can throw it away.
The library is a canvas - for the first time in such quantities - was in the thick spressovano four centimeters.
Under the influence of the heat and pressure of the so-called landbauplastic (klp) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, according to smell a bit like a new car and a little sneakers.
The top of the lead 105 steps.
Whoever wins the path length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic views of the city, but also the Dutch croquetami ficuses and baptized in pots.
They care about the environment, and in the first place about the proper humidity on literary grief.
The cost of a new soul
"it is hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of the environment," says trowboarst.
It is used for heating and cooling the warmth of the Earth.
Although the book Gore is under a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.
Large farms from laminated wood, placed perpendicular to the glass case, provide shade and make the most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection to provide fully automatic roller-blinds.
Stefan spermon, mentioned above skeptic of it, has already visited the new library.
Lizette verkhaig also was already here.
And also teaches traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, which is called the "soul bukenberg спейкениссе, which has long lacked."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own assembly.
These books were supposed to occupy the empty space on the shelves is still not fully staffed libraries - at that time it was 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves laden with top.
"there is nothing worse than polupustai library," says the architect blame Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way connected with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which is on the professional jargon called the creation of an identity.
Спейкениссе wrote his literary history.
And even if they are very young and uneducated.
It is only a starting point for building identity.

Clogs: "the Germans should play a more important role."
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, and in doing so, Berlin teetering on the narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: in the early weeks of Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinians "application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why? "
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Germany now need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position she also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - while not speaking too critical towards Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the introduction of the forbidden zone for flights.
In the end, NATO has conducted this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is so.
The point is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from the policy, which, so to speak, led by the United States, to the German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent unified policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this.
I believe that as long as they only track their role, but we are on the path to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which is France or Britain.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy with the German point of view?
It is a willingness to hold the position of their national interests, not dependent on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany in the largely differ from the interests of other large states, and that is why Germany must protect their interests.
Influenced whether these economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote at the UN?
First, Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it is not completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Whether Germany навредила its relations with the United States, refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote of the Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States dominates the understanding of the German position.
So I don't think that it was the same dramatic nadlom, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps, Germany even will thus a certain respect.
It is a signal that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage, and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, clearly voted for the veto.
Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
The strength of the American domestic politics such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, can't openly to hold such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion is not so significant, as it always is.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, I notice that Obama is not as enthusiastic about the policies of Netanyahu.
Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the major partner in the EU on the other?
I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not so.
So they can't act as part of a broader approach and have to instead act, relying only on his own vision of the situation.
That is the way they come with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that for Germany is not easy, at least because of their links with Israel.
This issue has always been a sensitive.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player is not take it upon themselves to really lead role?
Or the leading role still struggled in Germany?
Germany is not accustomed to this, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still has always struggled to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time when Germany takes over the role, are the most different feelings of boycott.
The Germans are not just to cope with it.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account the various neighbors and opinions, but it is not easy.
So, the influence of the United States in European politics permanently diminished, but at the moment the EU not to fill this vacuum, then who is?
The Germans simply have to play a more significant role.
Even if you don't like, unpleasant or strengthens dislike for you - such is life!

"the protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is the world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is the Armani polo?
It is officially registered in China, the name, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not be the case.
But then, it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas pattloh, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights to the trademarks in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.
Imitators enough to add a couple of letters, to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci, Lu-Gucci, Prada, you can register a Prada-kny.
The same way legally copied German companies, such as sporting goods maker Puma.
Pattloh opens the folder with records office registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered a trademark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, which is also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are the world champions, copied and violation of intellectual property rights, known.
In the big cities have a multilevel stores that sell almost exclusively of forgery.
However, no such cases pattloha. On behalf of its clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from the agency the right to use the name of the registration of trademarks, which already is somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "ban minpay," Mark-passenger.
It is a word associated with "ban dakuan."
The so-called women who are hunting for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the guilt
"it damages the business, with the need to fight," he convinced pattloh.
"trademark erodes, unique position is lost, the image of a very much suffering."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the market research firm CLSA, China with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third-largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
But achieving the removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloh tells about the cases in which the court rejected claims, because after a long time oprotestovannoe name has become "the reality of the market."
If the plaintiff is lucky, he will have to pay even plugiator, as damaged his trade sign in China, says pattloh.
Sometimes here ruled by the law of the jungle.
There is also a famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009, the company Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery maker Sany, Enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired-manufacturer Putzmeister concrete.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely bought Volvo company initially used the blue-and-white logo, looked like BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider himself guilty.
The registration of trademarks ctmo office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and equipment premises there had been difficulties.
But in the past year was "the return of the emergency situation in a workflow to normal."
So, the number of unprocessed affairs on objections decreased by 22 percent.
It was closed nearly 140 millon such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production office.
With this is expensive
As very often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
It is a record and means that China is the tenth consecutive topped the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.
In 2011, was paid $1.8 billion yuan fees.
If we simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Her appeal is worth many times more, as shown in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to achieve that illegal production of counterfeit auto parts has been liquidated.
However, the simulator cemented the Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
It was his own omission, as the name in Germany are not subject to protection, said hanno wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg chemical setting in Munich.
And the registration of trademarks ctmo münchentsev rejected the claim.
However, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the stronger side continues to struggle so far.
Need to be on guard
The question now is pending in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good finish and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also said: "the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
Domestic spending is unlikely to yield accounting, archive of the firm had to view even acts of a century ago, to give evidence.
Five years ago, vain Freudenberg suggested adverse side of the "great shestiznachnaya amount in Euro" for the settlement.
"it is clear how expensive it is," says wentzler.
The danger of the Far East threatened to break even in Europe.
But just in case, if the simulators register there the unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this unable to prevent the registration.
"we need to be vigilant," says wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer pattloh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on the protection of trademarks, most foreigners should be "all that is in any way is to protect, to register also in China," says wentzler.
Otherwise, it can do much more expensive than check.
Indeed, if the Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of the trade mark, it will have to pay to the adverse party licensing fees for its own sake, explains wentzler.
Otherwise we will push the market segment in the dark.

World AIDS Day: prithoptyvat, sing, to help
The choir is rehearsing in Heidelberg imbonga - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of the relations, overcome the distance more 8733 kilometers.
First heard stomping: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies and gents wear slippers pumps parqueting rhythm on the floor and quickly find him.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that, slowly rising voices of singers - Alt, bass, the tenor and soprano - they occur, fascinate and follow each other.
And fit Hopf, 29-year-old conductor, almost gets out of their матерчатых shoes when leads their flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg imbonga choir rehearsing a new song.
The Fifty members of the choir rehearsal came from 23 to 69 years old, from specialisti on human genetics to Porter.
"om" obani "is no easy thing, every voice choir has its text, the same on a prima facie alien language: zulusskoye, on which they say eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in some parts.
For help themselves
According to the evaluation of UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on AIDS, in the world there are about 34 million HIV-infected.
23.5 million of them live in the South Africa.
In Swaziland has 245, 000 orphans of AIDS.
With more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village of eSitjeni Association voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend school, gotovyaschaya to further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch in the Gogo-center.
The imbonga zulusskoye language means narrator or voskhvalitel.
In this room don't speak fluent in the Bantu, but know how to sing.
Nearly ten years choir разучивает songs on this strange soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
The distance from хайдельберга 8733 kilometers of the summer, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of eSitjeni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent of infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus -ic.
In a nutshell eSitjeni reflected the disease only Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, among the population of almost not accepted.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland's population are the human immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth of a dozen is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants imbogni saw many children in the streets, which lacked not only of parental care, but just barely: food, clothing, education.
Without school education a person in a poor country, there is no chance.
At first it was a private commitment to individual members - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later, he founded the Association "chorus of voices for Africa," which has since almost professionally takes care of orphans of AIDS in eSitjeni.
Facts about the infections, sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important disease, sexually transmitted?
The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea Tripper ().
Frequent viral infections are HIV, the human папиллома-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Lobkovy pediculosis and scabies belong to паразитарным STIs.
What are the main porajaemye group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute stems from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between the men.
The heterosexual adults often point of STDs, are chlamydial infection, trichomoniaz, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human папиллома-virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.
Among the youth chlamydial infections are significantly more often than among other groups.
According to European sources, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We among young people also often found human папиллома-virus.
Changing the number of cases of infection?
Not all of the disease, sexually transmitted, subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007, dropping.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints during urination, selection, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as the bubbles or seal.
But often they are not accompanied by headaches and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but did not provide 100% protection.
Partly because agents sexually transmitted diseases that can be spread by contact infection and through close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when you need to change sexual partners.
The early diagnosis can be cured most STIs and avoid the remote consequences.
Patronage, donations and not least honoraria for speeches chorus throughout Germany allow something to collect.
"all we sent in eSitjeni already about 200 000 euros," says Annet Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany manages tsodva Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
She also cares about orphans were well-organized, for example, one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as called on zulusskoye older women, it is the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them shelter and take care of the children in the form of every day to appear on the lessons.
Those who did not go home, go to the shelter to haniysil, lonely woman, receives a salary from the association, as well as two поварихи who every day are preparing for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the association "voices for Africa" organized Sewing School, built two henhouse and with the American Health Organization PSI organized surrender analysis on HIV for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so evident throughout the country, prefer deep silent.
The king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annet Lennartz, "because he is associated with sexuality."
Is quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The black Africa's last absolute monarch, King мсвати III, known for his love of largesse.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the Chinese state-style of life also lays the blame for the fact that the virus has spread so quickly and in past years.
But it is also a stray workers who carry the virus in the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annet Lennartz, "but they almost do not use.
Another culture - flesh-to-flesh. "
A little support to cultural exchanges, the choir ibmogni every two to three years, making a trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale and confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of the black continent know since the days of apartheid.
A bus full of White, who sing songs on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even that has happened, provoked tears to the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip is also leads in eSitjeni, where singers visit sponsored children.
Despite the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on a map in the Valley of the river etsulveni she more than known.
"go in eSitjeni, there is light," said local people.
But after 8733-km flight back in Heidelberg, when topajošiem singers return to репетиционный bergheimer facilities on the street, you can see that this light burns also here.

Messenger: NASA opens the ice on Mercury
"the probe messenger" found evidence that the planet Mercury is ice.
The thickness of the ice cover may have up to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also a frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
"the probe messenger" found evidence that are located in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or asteroid, confronted with the mercury.
Nobody sees the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, "said chief scientist Sean Solomon probe.
Temperature on the mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these findings could help explain how the water and other building blocks of life transferred to other places in the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example, "Phoenix" to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send to Earth images: small windows in the endless Dali.
The image comes with the camera, which was developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which turns around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment, "Spitzer telescope infrared image" is "family Portrait" countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of a blue points, more difficult to identify in a star circle of pink "newborn" stars.
This region zvezdoobrazovaniya neromantically - scientists call it "Spitzer telescope W5 - opened" in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
The iridescent fever dying star photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope. "
Like a doughnut ring consists of material which star threw in the process of dying.
The giant nebula Trifid, remote at 5,400 light-years from Earth, from the gas and dust are new stars.
NASA's Spitzer telescope "has made this photo galactic maternity Hall.
Star cluster Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with the telescope colors are better.
As the red-eye winks observer nebula snail on this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation Aquarius.
Similarity with the earthly continent has brought this nebula nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an emphatic colour reproduction.
This new star in the whole beauty managed to photograph only with the help of infrared sensors, "Spitzer telescope."
Saturn and its rings: how they have is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps it is the pieces of the moon of Saturn, which vanished disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope ": the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color images of the spiral galaxies turn into these works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory photo shows the remote for a few thousand light years Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word Trifid trifidus (trechdolny, trekhrazdeling), as the dark streaks of dust is divided into three parts раскаленное heart cradle of stars.
Formation astronomers photographed harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the kernel of the two merging galaxies rush towards each other and will inevitably face.
This is the birth of stars "Hubble telescope" took off in a spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations, may call it, nicknamed "the Southern tsevocally wheel."
Photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope, "shows a fragment of the nebula in the constellation of cepey iris.
Nebula, remote at 1,400 light-years, is composed of particles of dust, the size of which from 10 to 100 times less than the usual home dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, remote at 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called ARP 273 photographed for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. "
Scientists call a large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the bright group of new stars of our Milky Way.
Star cradle constantly creates new stars.
This is a stellar cloud, united with the nebula outlet, also constantly creates new stars, at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole is no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe had mostly hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans lipperosgeem - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the Mirror optical telescopes were becoming increasingly available - and their view of space deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope, "part" in the observatory Palomar under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, is "big binocularising telescope."
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"the Grand Prix telescopio Canarias" has a huge internal device - diameter mirror is one of only 10.4 meters.
"the big South African telescope Mirror" in South Africa segmentirovano - for the sake of reducing the cost.
Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches about 11 meters.
The lack of inexpensive constructive performance: telescope firmly stamped at a vertical angle is limiting his mobility.
The telescope "Hobby-eberli" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His feature: high svetosobirayushchaya ability.
She reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirrors - the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico) researchers listening for extraterrestrial signals in space.
Радиотелескоп has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the project, "the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), anyone with a computer can help by giving its processing power.
View of the European Astronomical Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is a "very large telescope" is entirely appropriate to his name.
His four mirrors allow cover in the visual tunnel even average infrared spectrum.
In the Chilean Observatory ESO also plans to install the European "very large telescope."
Its main mirror should raskynutsya by as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both of the Keck telescope, "" The Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They installed two mirror with a diameter of about ten meters.
"Keck telescopes on the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them is looking to the sky, with the help of telescopes" Subaru "and irttf.
In addition, on Mauna Kea should have new giant telescope - with a mirror with a diameter of three meters.
Here they can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space supplies "Hubble Space Telescope."
On April 24, 1990, he delivers a picture of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, "Kepler space telescope is searching for planets outside the solar system - the first such, on which it is possible to life.
February 2, 2011, NASA reported that i.e. 1,235 candidate planets have been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The photos show the last cooking "Kepler space telescope."
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than in 2018 year aboard the rocket Ariane 5. "
The main mirror infrared space telescope with a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: he should, in light of the first stars and galaxies look for the big bang.
The scientists suggest that Mercury is ice at the South Pole.
However, there is no reliable data about this, so as a "messenger" moves closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades, pointed out that the mercury is ice.
Thanks to the running in 2004 zondu "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury, scientists are now confident in this.

Drink butter every day - and live up to 168 years
Many residents in the Southern Azerbaijan reach a biblically getting older.
Even here there is a museum of longevity.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year-old men are still relatively young.
Many residents in the Southern Azerbaijan reach a biblically getting older.
Even here there is a museum of longevity.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year-old men are still relatively young.
Trip through the Talish Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
Minibus with tearing rumbling rolls on the winding road past the overgrown with dense forest Hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright, that you might think, if you are in the Black Forest.
But it is the most southern region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here.
Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they are fluent in Farsi and azerbaizhdanskom and different longevity.
The final point is leric.
A small town flaunts too ponderous architecture of Soviet times, which is not in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost didn't come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too utomitelna.
Of the 323 kilometers takes eight hours, as the road has only one lane.
Legendary wealth, which the country owes oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not gotten.
But Pilate фатулаева (48) is convinced that leric than there is of interest to tourists.
"in May, Baku became famous festival song contest - and the next year we will host a festival of the oldest people in the world," says фатулаева.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here are documented biography about eight dozen Talysh of these places, which is more than 100 years. Фатулаева points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was here for 120 years.
At the age of 136 years he was born in another child
But the controversial star of the museum is directors shirali mueslyumov, who allegedly was 168 years.
Certificates of birth, however, is not.
But given the fact that the oldest person whose age is confirmed by documents, was 122 years, age mueslyumov seems extremely doubtful.
"he was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains фатулаева.
Man has been married three times, and he was 23 of the child, at the age of 136 years he allegedly was born daughter.
So whether Chaban mueslyumov added a couple of dozen years to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher at the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about dolgozhitels in Central Asia.
"surprisingly, many older people also can be found in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia also lives very many very old people."
However, because of the lack of scientific proof of age is impossible, because it was not the civil status registers.
Every day a glass of baked oil
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of lerica strikingly often reach biblical age.
Now here is home to 20 people over 100 years.
Why here, in the South, so many livers?
Azerbaijani Farid mugimzad guide explains this specific genes Talysh.
The director of the Museum of фатулаева, by contrast, believes that the diet.
Talysh like meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drinking on stakanu baked oil every day, but it is unlikely that such a higher calorie content can be a healthy diet with dietologicaskaya point of view.
Or the primitive lifestyle, which keeps people youth? in chengamiran, a tiny village near the town of leric, lives rubaba Mirzoev.
In the 97 years old she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Мирзаева, which argues that she 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with бочкой oils, which tirelessly катает back and forth.
Here under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Mirzayev, which have long been already have their grandchildren.
Also nearby are jumping two babies.
Guests in the kitchen preparing tea, which is served in a typical pot-bellied cold glasses armudu.
The Mirzayev perfectly aligned and sturdy white teeth, under the main handkerchief she hides the long, dark-blond braids that her son proudly opens before us.
I always have my hair milk, so that they never pull out and saved the color.
"and I have never used shampoo," says мирзаева.
The monthly pensions enough for life
She always ate only what has grown in its own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.

But it has become better when "beloved father, Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda is not often sounds in the speech of the old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then took the reins of his son, Ilham.
Yet among the Azerbaijani elders there is poverty.

And, perhaps, long-raised son Mirzayev too human: "old people in our culture are deep respect."
They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
Not the reason to stay alive as long as possible

The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo show the deep rift in the country.
The future constitution, based on sharia, met fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president not funded the pathos.
We must create a transition.
"and its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was turned to all people, but in the first place to the Christian coptm, liberals, enlightened Muslims and religious Egyptians.
After all, they are all still hopelessly fragmented in nonplussed by the opposition, fear.
The fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. "
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he was temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence, "to save the revolution."
But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the University of Southern California, did not entirely clear Egyptians and around the world.
Will there be deprived of the power of the judiciary?
In fact, 234 articles have managed to smuggle in a 15-hour jump with obstacles on the Islamic configured constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and it is partly raises fears.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the trial is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But that means "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and we fear that Islamists will use blurred formulation and arising in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia.
At least, it suggests one novovvedyonnaya article: in all matters relating to Sharia law, should be encouraged for the Council of the University of al-Ashar, crucial Islamist institution in the country with great authority in Sunni Islam.
It should not, but may mean that the clergy enforces laws that de-facto restriction would be the result of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution much is subject to interpretation
Another problem: should be retained jurisdiction of civilians in military court.
These courts during the rule of Mubarak served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family," and "maintain its morals and values."
Legally it formulated so vague that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of the film and literature.
Open text, it means nothing, as censorship.
In general, no article does not set right the equality of men and women.
But another prohibits insulting and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Also questionable is the wording that prohibited "insulting people."
Whether there will be enough cartoons of the president or jokes about правоведа?
The question of interpretation, like many in this project, which Morsi offers on the signature and who, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians on the referendum.
"the revolution is back."
For several weeks, formed the opposition against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual unanimity on the evening of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can enter into force.
"the revolution is back, and we win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place finisher in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed el-Baradei said that the draft constitution place "on the scrapheap of history."
A short news service Twitter followers he accused Morsi's desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"if he declares referendum, we will go to his palace and skinem him," said opposition Yasser said.
"we are still not tired, the blood of our brothers have not otmzena," he quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many of the judges also said that he did not want to watch the referendum that would make it invalid.
"the Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized by the Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for opposing demonstrations, but as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafi supporters, who shouted: "the people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi: "очисти country!" and assured: "the Koran is our constitution."
The power struggle over the largely symbolic square, where it all began, almost triggered a state of civil war.
Supporters of Morsi, quite clearly, did not want to go to this risk.
"the Muslim Brotherhood, said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution argued loudly and clearly.
Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
The majority of the Islamists, it is considered a done deal.
"the notion of" human rights "is not mentioned anywhere."
Hafiz Abu Sayeda in fury from this accelerated the constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February, with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (eopr) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, "when Mubarak they sat in jail or tangential before the court.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because the human rights for him, indivisible.
For this he was beaten, jailed, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never meet in a new constitution, regrets it in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
The expansion of the influence of Morsi on all three branches of government in the state disappoints lawyer.
These measures represent a significant attacks on democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
"instead of having to strengthen the civilian government, president of the de-facto annulled his," regrets Sayeda.
After all, without civil organizations democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that all left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This can occur for payment.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "you are creating a monster, which will not be able to control."

The Norwegian racfisc: the most badly smelling of fish in the world?
With a total population of Norway, one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely zlovonary fish dish?
Take a few perezrevshih pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and steaming sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You could smell the smell othschibayuschiy racfisca - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, in a three-hour drive from Oslo.
Around capped scenic views. "it is a very beautiful, but in the air razlit neistrebimiy tangy smell.
Racfisc is a trout, posypannaya salt and brodivshaya in water up to a year, depending on how it is nice to be achieved.
As the gathering twilight and kholodaet, crowds of Norwegians are collected at the festival in Fagernes dedicated it to, say, exciting dish.
"it is eaten raw and chewing glass of Aquavit, local tminnaya vodka," explains хавард halvarsen, local fire by profession and moonlights as a "general" racfiscovy, who runs the festival.
All around us people eat presliced small diced fish and chewing her massive amounts of alcohol.
"someone like Akwawit than racfisc," says хавард. "
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If we manage to smuggle piece under the noses, things are not so bad - hardly differs from portions of land, which you have long taken with him on the bus.
Norwegian racfisc is the product of an entirely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the autumn in insulation zamachivali closed barrels with salt water.
Then, deep in the winter, when the fish is already well and thoroughly zabrodila, her извлекали and prigłuszyv perception of alcohol consumed in food.
Even on the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now, the population has been growing rapidly - more than 13 percent are immigrants, which involve here jobs, higher wages and a well-developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a longtime rival, but still not so long ago and far more wealthy neighbor) massively come here to work.
Racfisc is seen as an important symbol, indispensable, though few foul element of the past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here are expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you at 9 pounds (14 dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the News of the world, and most people in this country, it seems, satisfied.
People here still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, racist and extremist right-wing, last year rasstrelavshego, killing 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, called the attack "happened on July 22."
Norwegiam very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings.
At the heart of today's well-being is the growth of Norway (since the early 1970s), one of the largest oil and gas fields in the world.
"but oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress getting trays with elegant rakfiscom, a woman with long blond hair and striking blue eyes, blond incarnation of well-being.
We are a nation - how do you call it is reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she is fluent in English.
We don't like to exhibit at the show, we're not khvastlives.
Norway is very carefully drawn from its oil is a big part of the income of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when all sorili money, which they were not, Norway thrifty podschityvala all costs.
"as long as you can go skiing in the winter and go to the movies in the summer, it's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"and there are racfisc", "she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for some food - racfisca with me enough.
Here's a whopper with Losin meat is certainly exotic, tasty сочное meat.
But in the evening, we expect more of the same fish with unforgettable smell.
In my hotel to hold a special dinner dedicated racfisc, during which visitors will determine the best or, perhaps, the most aromatherapy fish.
There is a direct телеэфир, in which show leading into the bow tie, surrounded by plates with rakfiscom.
It is like the "Eurovision song contest."
"so, Tor-Jurgen, what kind of judgment you have set for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"yes, хавард, here's our assessment..."
All laughed and applauded.
Someone falls off the chair, perhaps перебрав Aquavit.
And maybe, just nadyshavshis smell of fish.

Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start of his career.
While the newly Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to join the office, a correspondent of the BBC will grant invites us to look at the difficulties, with whom he will have to face, and the mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Traffic in Mexico City now in particularly poor condition.
This city is overloaded transport and in the best time, and Monday were erected steel barricades, pererezavshie several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to let people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protesters to get to the building of the parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto sets presidential перевязь and will take the reins of the country.
Before him is no easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which now keeps its powers, but the country is embroiled in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed some 60,000 lives.
"my government says the people of Mexico about his readiness to deal with violence," he said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to suggest a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Such statements before the president of the United States, the political career of Mr. Peña Nieto developed to serve as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, a vast and populous state surrounding the capital of the country, opinions are divided about the new leader.
A staunch man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, about him fondly remembered.
Residents put him in the merit of the revival of tourism, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure.
You can get to the city on one of the new highway, built by Mr. Peña Nieto, who are very different from the roads with a rut and Yam, who were previously on this place.
Signs with his name are hanging on a modern building sports center and the impressive interactive museum, dedicated to climate change.
"we associate with the hope of real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, a congressman from the state led by Peña Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive change, which is so badly needed in our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI was expelled in 2000, Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he denied the charges in a meaningless, who put forward the new president of the opposition.
He is very прямолинеен and very devoted to the cause of his vision of the future of the country.
It is a great statesman, and, above all, the people who listen.
But in other parts of the state, many people will have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality nesahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad ment, is the most striking contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under estacadami highways, he is in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are too severe nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, for the pacification of gangs that sell drugs in these areas, the troops were involved; and violence against women is a particularly acute.
The vacant near the vast landfill only in the past two years, was found dozens of bodies of murdered women.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during a particularly on Mr Peña Nieto is significantly higher than a similar measure in the infamous proslavivshemsya violent city of Ciudad Juárez, the name of which sea when it comes to murder innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, about him in the best case, we can say that during his tenure as governor, he was not able to cope with the problem of the killings of women.
In the worst case, however, his administration has been accused of ignoring the problem.
A resident of concrete houses, like most of the houses in this обветшалом district, Irineos Buendia barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of her late daughters Marian moon.
According to the official version of the Mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she killed her inmate.
"when I went to her house, it seems that her body was washed before this," recalled Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body has already okochenelo.
Mother Marian retells the story, and a portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, which was written in just one word: Justice.
In this, they said, was denied this family.
"state officials appealed to me as with the old splentitsei, discontented narushitelnica peace.
They want people to simply accept on faith of all that, they say, and pomalkivali.
But it is wrong, so you can't, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings, "she says.
Wearing the presidential перевязь on Saturday, president of Peña Nieto with her to take the major responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico are affecting the crimes of violence, and the new president promised to make a decision on this issue a priority during his rule.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same as president, what was the governor," says Olvera, Congressman from the Valle de Bravo from the PRI.
But this is what is most fear the families of the victims in Ciudad ment.

Bradley Manning not complained of mistreatment, the indictment says.
Prosecutors are trying to refute the claims of Bradley Manning about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing of the special attention was paid to stay Manning in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manning's confinement were brutal.
The U.S. Army private accused in the kidnapping of several thousands of secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, took advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint about mistreatment, which, according to him, he had to endure, while in military custody.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing at Fort foreign ministry, Maryland, a military prosecutor Maj. Ashenden Fein said that record weekly visits Manning representatives of the administration of the prison for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not contain allegations of mistreatment.
Cross-examination under consideration by the defence motion to stop Manning of the case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were brutal and themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the day after Manning said that while in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military expert analysis of intelligence data, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of kidnapping of several thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the website WikiLeaks.
Resource WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was Manning.
During a hearing on Friday, prosecutor Fein together with Manning checked the reports, which were filled after visits to the Manning administration officials during his stay in prison Quantico, where he was on a strict regime of imprisonment from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits to the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that assesses the appeal to himself from the administration of the prison as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
Reviewed reports do not contain allegations of mistreatment, despite the fact that Manning directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fein said.
Manning said that he had spoken expressed concern about these issues and that he visited his administration officials discussed with him these problems and stated that they will, but not recorded it in writing.
"they recorded" no problems "(after discussing my complaints), but this does not mean that I have not raised the subject in conversation," said Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning, why he never complained of abuse to him in January 2011, during a meeting of the commission, rassmatrivavshey suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing for several months before.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to ensure that his regime was removed from the "prevention of injury" and softened the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited detention regime - a level lower than the regime of supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the security of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that with me all right, so they canceled the regime to prevent injury... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and sent to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months, before being transferred to the prison at the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he thought about suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness from the intense heat.
He explained that the psychologically very difficult when you do not know how to solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
"my world shrank back to base camp arifzhan, up to the size of my prison," Manning said on Thursday.
"I thought that I was going to die in that cage."
While in Quantico, Manning, according to him, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in solitude.
Manning said that he was allowed to leave only mattresses, blankets, slippers, a few items of clothing and sunglasses.
He says that he tried to move, so as to sleep or even just lie in the daytime ban rules.
According to Manning, while sleeping in his eyes he consistently beat the light coming from the outside camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he perevorachivalsya in bed at night, he said, his arousing and forced to turn over on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection about illegal treatment with Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning's statement, which he made during his testimony on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during the morning inspection.
Manning said he had no opportunity to defend myself blanket during the investigation.
Answering questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the order of guard that must throw blanket, which could hide behind, but conceded that nobody does not directly ordered him to drop it.
On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked for his attempts to show the officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use the gum cowards or slippers to hurt themselves, but has not done so.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and points taken away from the camera.
His lawyers hope the judge, at least, take what he had to endure while in detention, and significantly reduce the sentence, if Manning is convicted by military court, which is to begin a review of his case at the beginning of next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning admit guilt for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of hearings scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the detention conditions were acquitted.
The Pentagon argues that Manning held in Quantico in accordance with rules governing the content of those arrested with the most strict regime.
Among the accusations, nominated Manning, listed as aiding the enemy, it is illegal to promote the publication of data on the Internet, transmitting information relating to the national defense, and the abduction of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all points of the indictment, he could face life in prison.

My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country about the difficult times.
Ruben navarett believes that Mexicans American-born torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I went down the hall to arrive, approached the border control zone and remained in place.
Signs pointed to the two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for foreign (foreigners).
I have a few seconds stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life called Mexican.
It's just a name, just as my friends in Boston called themselves the Irishmen, and friends from New York consider themselves the Italians.
Later, I stopped on a complex structure, "Mexican American."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complex constructions.
"I was just American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary poorer than the native language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I took out his U.S. passport and was in line for the piece.
I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were usual for meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
President of Peña Nieto willingly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of having to move to the United States.
He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc similar to the European Union.
In addition, the president of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals not sounded.
For Mexico, relations with the United States - heavy and executed the old grievances question.
Most Americans have never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded in Mexico and at the barrel rifles forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.
But the Mexicans think centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all.
Why should any of us statesman obmallvitsya though word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society immediately heard complaints that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma preispolnyayutsya militancy.
This is the most complicated relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about the insults?
Their enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are in this country for themselves, and those for whom there is no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history of someone's father or grandfather - have not had the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most of these were Mexicans of a certain type of dark complexion, education, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember about this.
In Mexico, it see otherwise.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and made ourselves a good job, but we should not forget that even this dream is an American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination and запутано is unclear, but we know what the country considered his.
The United States of America.
At the same time, we know that the majority of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class we don't like.
We answer to them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us like second-class people, as the Mexicans inauthentic.
We are not well speak in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico not strong enough.
Our very existence for them due to failure.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We don't have now for the silk curtain, finding in the US smug life, but lost the spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States, even in childhood, and it reminds me of that between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent, there is some friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin is a shame.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my friends, the Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them.
We listen Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
But in the United States have called the Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relationship without enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans to Mexican origin were sort of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States.
We could tell their friends-Americans about what this beautiful country and how cool her visit, and would be able to convince the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing will.
Too many grievances in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, widespread corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not believe that the country is too great.
Sorry, but разбирайтесь with this themselves, check.
And this is true.
If a fraction of Mexicans still can't forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico half a century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent still in Milan for the way most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes it.
Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought.

The old battle on the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas group could become a fragile foundation for further peace
Prospects for a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
Sound that became familiar, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in its izvechnom conflict in the Middle East came changes.
It can be treated differently, but the events of the "Arab Spring" in the breakaway zakruzhili storm many established realities, with the Israelis and the Palestinians have not managed to stay away from the vortex, shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than previously.
However, there are reasons, giving hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
The war without winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be performed, occurred on this week's clashes only strengthened security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, protesting against what they forced Israel to retreat, despite the losses incurred by them.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is boosting its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and wealthy friends.
Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the wealthiest and fastest growing states of the Persian Gulf.
The victorious Hamas supporters claim on the establishment of the Islamic crescent around Israel from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more proislamistic rebels to overthrow the rule of President Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king is threatened by allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and influential Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not udelyavshim special attention to the support of Hamas.
Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are the organization, is largely similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic rasstanovkah Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice can't drown out even to Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "hard" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel's "Iron Dome" missile system justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the abandoned Hamas rockets.
Israeli citizens can sleep easy, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence in the Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank is a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the elections set for January 22 - teamed with even more offensive minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient.
What sense condone the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If you give away all the power in their hands on the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from rockets toward Israel, as their brethren in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to raise their heads.
Perhaps, supporters of the "hard" line victorious; but their calculations can be disproved the Arab Spring.
Despite the fact that the Islamists, who have come to power in Egypt and other countries, have had the most warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be the internal problems.
Part of Israel's defense budget, more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
War with a regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
Pragmatism, president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the ceasefire, which is a good sign and may mark the beginning of change.
Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.
At least for Democratic Change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that would sooner or later explode in the Israeli occupied territories, like the bus, vzorvannomu in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
For the bloody operations, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas movement, has to pay a growing discontent with the international community.
Both sides need in the external impetus
It remains the only solution to which relentlessly call sensible representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education of two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, "the hope that the cease-fire would allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which has long time to decide to block the delivery of weapons into the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967 with an exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts towards reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming vote in the United Nations, which may result in a virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood.
Their role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.
During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he continued to show a reluctance to connect to solve this problem.
It is disastrously недальновидная position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

In Australia, the law came into force on the unified packaging for cigarettes.
Warnings about the hazards of smoking and disease affected by images of body parts stand in contrast to the damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice Australian law on the same pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same box of glum-olive color with the terrible images of affected parts of the body, and images of children, the health of which undermined smoking their parents.
In addition to the different images and inscriptions, warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the stacks, introduced in mandatory with this Saturday - the name brands, which printed the same fine print.
This is the most severe in the world conditions for the packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia says that the purpose of this action is to deter young people from smoking, depriving the habit fashion status.
On the basis of this decision based on the results of the studies that showed people, not to impose a smoking up to 26 years, 99 times out of 100 never become smokers.
"it is clear that even at a young age children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," said Health Minister Tanya plibersec, citing a study by that, for example, the crown in the logo in children is associated with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of smokers in the world, so that these changes will not affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of adopting such measures have already seen, and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed to the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of black market, which will be sold on the cheap and available cigarettes.
"this law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought it was initiated," said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco Company in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business.
Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette and silicone cases, hides unpleasant images on the package, rapidly grew up (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case to the High Court of Australia, where they tried to challenge the law.
According to Sandra ha, Zico has already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects the new party.
For us, this is a good business.
A potential obstacle for the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among precisely that part of the population, the aim of these measures.
In Australia after the adoption of a number of laws that makes illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibit vendors displaying cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it cannot limit in this foreign sites.
"if you sell tobacco and you are left with only this small loophole, the idea is to promote their products on the Internet looks like a very attractive," explains Beca Freeman, exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, on social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether this was the work of the ordinary citizen, who is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare no effort and time and made the video, or advertising company behind it?
The Australian unit of British American Tobacco argues that the industry is more busy adapting to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states have claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that it was unfair trade restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all these countries are very slim.
Decision of the WTO is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya plibersec, the government has discussed with other countries to adopt similar laws on their packaging.
In 2001, Canada first introduced mandatory posting photos, warning about the hazards of smoking.
Now it is generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of a tightening of laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovations.
These pictures of me not touching.
I just don't pay attention.
"just vyhvatyvaesh cigarette and pryachesh pack in his pocket," explains Viktor Al Haig, buys cigarettes with a photograph of cancer of the mouth of the pack.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me quit - this is my little daughter.
James Yiu, head of the store tobacco was King of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same packaging complicated task of goods on the shelves
"before I on the unloading of the new party left for an hour, and now four hours'," he complains.
"the government should have to take and not ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, OK, it's over, closing shop," he says, vskidyvaya hands up.

Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections - it's not so bad.
This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because of our aircraft were mechanical problems and he was replaced by another plane, which we and waited.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight - it's really boring, and there is not much help either books, magazines, no iPhone, nor even the duty-free shops.
But in recent years, more and more scientists and experts on child development support in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children get bored isn't so bad.
It forces the brain distracted on interesting related topics that may be conducive to creativity.
And because in the modern world we all are constantly before some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we need to strive to boredom?
Yes. "
And at the same time, there.
We will come back to this.
I, like many, believed that boredom is a relatively recent invention of times, when people have appeared more free time.
This is not so, says Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history of Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book "the fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"in fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating from the first century.
It remains an open question as to how we understand the boredom.
The problem is, "said John D. Eastwood, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed.
Having studied the materials research on this topic and asking the question of the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but you can't do that would give them the satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that skuchayuschiy people not doing something that would like to do.
I don't want to do anything the apathy.
The main in переживаемой boredom, he says, is a "violation of the attention and associated with the deterioration in sentiment and a sense that time goes slowly."
According to the description of boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible link between the two conditions, skuchajošiem people see the causes of the problems in the outside world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself.
Sometimes it seems that we are bored, when in fact we just find it difficult to focus on something.
In his study, "the unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues cite conducted earlier experiment, participants listened to a recording of the voice, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard loud noises are not relevant to the case of TV programs included in the next room, others heard these same sounds on low volume, so that they can be almost impossible, and a third group listened only to record a vote without sound track.
Those participants who heard a low-volume, noted that they were bored, most of them - it was hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause weariness, said Mark J. fensk, associate professor of neurology at the University of guelpa, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, всматриваясь in the flow of goods on the line in search of marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom."
It is considered, he said, that when people start pokachivatsya on a chair or paint a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions not just help relax physically.
"research has shown that children who do not prohibit fidget and swing, learn better and remember more information than children, from which require you to sit down," said Professor fensk.
In some moments we are all feeling bored: a delayed flight (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, watching the humdrum film.
But different people have different degree propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s to measure such individual researchers have developed a special "scale of the propensity to boredom."
To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, "much of what I have to do, monotonous and chant" or "me too much fun, so I don't have enough time."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that bored boys more than girls, "said Stephen vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida," in particular with a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which he contacted via pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 percent of teens said that they were bored in school and while doing homework, and 23 percent said that they were bored outside the school.
While only 3 percent of parents said that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no information about what would such data about boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that "in adolescence is the peak of the propensity to boredom," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully resolve than they do.
Let's get back to my original question: boredom useful?
Sometimes no, because in extreme cases it, studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor vodanovich, devoted to the study of the problem for more than two decades.
"so our brain tells us that we should do something different; it is the boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always knows what it is better to do.
If you will be bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.
But if you watch TV, you will be better only for some time, and soon it will take place.
So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, he will miss, but he did not learn to deal with boredom independently or in any other way to manage their time and employment, "said Professor fensk.
"such skills and self-regulation use in a variety of situations," he said.
Your child learns not only to occupy themselves something, he also learns to control at all.
I don't think that boredom need to somehow praise.
But consider it something bad is not worth it.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action, and technology.
Professor Eastwood agree with this.
"we see it so that we need more experience boredom, with boredom is extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people tend to disconnect from the constant worries and just relax.
"in the modern world we are accustomed to the constant over-stimulating the senses," he says, "and when the silence, and we don't know what to do."

While it is unclear how the new law will apply on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony Orozco, Nineteen-player football team and the student community college in the south-east of the state of Colorado charged with a criminal offence, essentially that will soon be entirely legally throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he and his friends had been in Lamar and rode in the car on the Prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco came agenda in court for drug possession and possession of a device for drug use is a minor offences, each of which had a fine of $100 dollars - and set the date for the trial.
"we are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But the offender whether he?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small-scale prosecutions depends not so much from the law, many from consideration.
Charged with minor offences related to marijuana, has already been charged in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charges to people under the age of 21 years and older for possession of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks, the law comes into force.
However, in the more conservative districts in Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing cases related to marijuana, and still attract accountable for possession of marijuana.
At the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to mountainous areas of the West are voting for, to avoid the appearance of their places in the new, licensed by the state of shops selling marijuana.
"all of this is growing so fast that I don't even know what to expect further," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also ozadacheno pochesyvayut head.
They will formulate rules to determine the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all that needs to be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of issues of the use of marijuana for medical purposes in the first, and now for entertainment.
"in Colorado in a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian and. Smith, a spokesman for the council to regulate the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in the state of Washington.
But now, no one can do more, "admits Mr Smith, than to put forward any proposals and hope that it will work.
"we have no real precedent, on which we could focus," he says.
The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and for the whole year, plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when there is no state licensing system, and the right to possession of marijuana has been institutionalized.
But there are in fact still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed in this period, for example, how to find a balance between state regulation of "adequate access" to the licensed marijuana with a ban on trade it within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"it will be especially difficult to place the licensed trade in marijuana plants in the inner cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently established research group called the Center for the legalization of marijuana. "
On November 21, Aurora police chief Oates of his subordinates sent an e-mail message that the office of the city will no longer attract people who have reached the age of 21 years, accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police stops ulichat people in these violations, "from this moment."
Police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal dealers and distributors of drugs.
Prosecutor Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that prosecutors will continue to hold accountable for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage the use of its people to undergo treatment.
At the moment, the 119 persons charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.
"the duty of our institutions - the chase for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed," said Mr tank in a statement.
The response was controversial even in places such as rural Mesa County, where participants vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer attracts adult responsibility for possession of small amounts of marijuana.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take charge of the already open matters relating to the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until he won't change is our duty," he said.
Despite the fact that 55 percent of residents of the state of Colorado, who participated in the voting, supported the decision, the inclusion of issues of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be simple.
A controversial reaction of residents in different parts of the state revealed ambiguity relations of local authorities to experiment with marijuana in the state.
"the district prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier," explains Sean makalister to have a lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"they're so long persecuted people for this is that now can't really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he said.
Colorado and Washington - The United States, in which a small amount of marijuana are treated the same as to alcohol is destined to be experimental field throughout the country to test the idea of legalizing drugs.
Advocates of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautiously awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, who still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Marijuana legalization advocates hope that the Department of Justice to give on this issue.
Despite several received wide resonance arrests of traffickers and patients reported using marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government gave the go-ahead in most cases of trafficking of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau for the fight against drugs are unlikely to be interrupted at home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are hardly likely to turn a blind eye to the regulatory authorities in the state of shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on anti-drug in the Obama administration.
Some of the city in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores to sell marijuana, and so would not be able to open up earlier than a year.
Last week, монтроуз, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"we don't want to be in this position that we will issue the license to someone, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we see a contradiction between the results of the local voting and those who voted for the state.
Is still a lot of unresolved issues.

Petronella whiatt: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I'm conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views were not today.
As long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world, the institution, the modern-day equivalent of the ancient symposium, zakladyvayuschiy two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study on historical faculty woosterskogo College at Oxford University in the late 1980s, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father didn't pass and burst into tears.
The friends were are bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I threw college, because I didn't like that my classmates have sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left, because I had to drink from Shcherbatykh cups.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, ran, because I was systematically hounded and intimidated.
It's not because of my rather unusual name or that I attended a private school.
I was hounded for only one reason, and in this renowned cradle просвещенности it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow whiatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a follower of conservatives.
You ask, why to reminisce about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, reinforces that center-right views, is subject to the same kind of harassment.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of the students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as the one who is disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The conservatives from the student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge claim that their "often actively isolate, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter into the committee on equal rights college of additional representative to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation is aggravated released recently on BBC Two documentary about politics in the student environment "country wonders: young, smart and right-wing," in which the Conservatives presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film was shown Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who drives a Rolls-Royces, wears a silver suit and walking stick with a silver nabaldashnikom.
In other universities students-conservatives complain that they are "scapegoats because of the higher school fees."
Luke black, 20 years, vice-president of the Association of conservatives from Nottingham University, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that "in a university environment increases skew toward the left.
The people who we don't even know in advance believe us arrogant and unpunished unruly children of wealthy parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the history department at Corpus Christi College, which was filed a petition on strengthening the protection, calls this "neuutist atmosphere" and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says that the attitude of the members of the center-right-wing student club gaining significantly deteriorated.
"this represents a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, or simply to normal life members of the club," she said.
The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was one.
I came back in September 1986, timid and shy vosemnadtsyatyletneu girl.
Oxford лихорадило from hatred of the Conservative party.
The year before, the University of voting deprived former student of Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even Revolutionnaire.
In the first days of the week freshmen, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt what awaited me ahead.
I still didn't know that teachers not only looked through the fingers on the hunt students-conservatives, but also gladly took part in it.
The political issues - the miners' strike, the privatization of government and opposition to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated through the walls trimmed wood panelling audiences.
On my first workshop I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century in English, and I was not prepared for what followed it.
"miss whiatt," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was me with hard, I hesitated.
Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face, like a cake.
"thatcherist fundamentally not teach French or they simply did not have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students захихикали.
In my eyes were full of tears.
"I advise you to take a few basic lessons of the French in his spare time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society," probryuzzhal Pitt.
I went back to my room is miserable.
That evening in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student at the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of Conservative University.
"I know who you are," he said in a friendly.
"unfortunately, it is as follows:
Over every, anyone suspected of sympathizing with the Conservatives, will scoff.
I'm very easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most of the freshmen and conservatives pretend that they Labour. "
Later, in a local pub, I timidly trying the scenes.
I insisted on the fact that he did not agree with all that says Margaret Thatcher.
The trick failed.
A freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "you are the daughter of a fascist pigs.
You are contagious. "
Other students picked up his words.
I was flawed, dirty.
"as the Conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
"they колотят each other, right?"
I felt like it must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the Sixties.
Can I ever to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced labor and hide their true beliefs?
Coming to me three years began to seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, has not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
His hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speechwriters.
In college, he did not appear.
He despised him for provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist-deterministicmu view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"here you can't be happy," he told me.
I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and impartial Metropolitan friends.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s there were any political views.
"but it's the best university in the world," he said plaintively.
"there is not capable, not only in the city of dreaming spires....
Even my friends-Communists always behaved impeccably. "
His wet eyes pomutneli.
"don't pick up any hasty decisions.
I am sure that this is just a joke.
You're разобьешь my heart, no matter if the university. "
I was crafting regular visits to London and my emotional defense weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, unable to bear the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.
The next week at the seminar, when another history teacher quite seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the heart of burning with shame, I admitted that "I was brainwashed brains parents," and called them "old fools."
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford, was destined to score my father.
At the same time he every week wrote two columns for newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I'm not married, and after five minutes of my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.
I have not returned.
You can call me plaksoy and cloth.
But in the eighteen years nobody should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment.
Even sadder, however, that it was the Oxford, which not only released 14 prime ministers of the Tories, but to this day behind undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and dissidence.

"Valentino prefers elegance of glory."
The exhibition "Valentino: master of sewing," which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Nachi Abascal, фионой Thyssen-bornemica and other well-known female Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of the British Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, a worthy to take an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer admitted that during the opening of "Valentino: master of sewing," triumphal retrospective exhibition, which brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses, created his "home" for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the history, the only character which is "Il Signor" Garavani, but she could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated with rare and distant world nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition is open until March 3, with personal letters and photographs signed by most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salim Aga Khan to Lord snowdona, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of their social upheaval: from humble tailor from voger in the north of Italy before the idol of the international "elite."
Be enamored with the Royal Court - there is nothing wrong.
"they would not draw a cigarette butts of their cigarettes on your beautiful carpet, as do some of the great stars of pop music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-bornemica.

The hardest job in the world: the miners with kavakh-igena
The four Euro Indonesian miners risking life and limb, utaskivaya 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on steep trails combined
There are people for whom they work - hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them are the Zaporizhzha Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living in the mines of sulphur-idzhen kavakh Volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day the Zaporizhzha descends on the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of the Earth, hardens on contact with air.
Otkolov huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, shoulders baskets on the shoulders and held them up the precipitous rocky road.
Up to the top of the volcano, which is the height of 39.411 meters, only 250 meters, but ismozhdenic gruzchik takes more than 40 minutes to climb snail's pace, with Labour holding the balance and carefully nashupyvaya road to not оступиться and not fall off a cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened with one туристкой from France, which fell a few years ago with rocks kavakh-igena.
Miners with kavakh-igena earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which mined
Once at the top, they pave his way between the tourists who have their photograph, as if they were monkeys from the circus and wearily carrying heavy baskets, stride three kilometers to the scales that mining company put a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
It is about 95 Kandy ngrimbi, company, which operates in 1960, the volcano and it is better not to say, of its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industries, because this mineral circulated in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"as the norm is perenoska 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each hodka," explains US antonyms, which usually carries three daily carrying.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels exhausted, but they allow him to amass 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems mizers for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"podennaya fee miners is very high on the local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," explains Porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was just 75.00 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the plot was not so heavy, but the Zaporizhzha returned with his family in bâniovangi, a small town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is the same crushing like sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to the Jawa, converted to Islam."
The Zaporizhzha asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he slezyatsya eyes because of toxic gases
In his 27 years antonyms spent three years, risking a kavakh-idzhen, sulfur which has already started to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he slezyatsya eyes because of toxic gases, which allocates a volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.
"it'll for two more years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French," he promises a more than acceptable English.
Punished with life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a doorman at the hotel, but instead he performs work mule.
Sharing dirty wooden hut with other носильщиками, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur does not cease to flow at night, when its distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and glitters amid the gloom.
Challenging the shadows, Zaporizhzha descends into the crater, covering a small flashlight, podsoedinennym to his Cascais, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters to smuggle baskets with Gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company not mechanized extraction sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment носильщикам who work at their own expense and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not get even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for photographing, who, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge with tourists who come to photograph a volcano and his men and mules.
"this work for cattle, and not for the people," says badrusin, stocky носильщик 42 years, who spent on kavakh-idzhen three decades, ever since I left college.
Able to raise up to 110 pounds, he insists that he will accept the job "as long as it can," because he needed money for the education of his three children, aged from 18 to 10 years.
Do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although the sulfur burning throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in the dense pillars of smoke, emerging from a volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their heavy disease... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in the knees and ulcers on his shoulders, which deformirovalis under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing basket on his back, unaynik now only can raise 50 kilogram in his 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades endure 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three truck carrying on a warehouse in tamansari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the swamps.
"don't go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says unaynik, widely opening her mouth, which is missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years, also works as a carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation is one of the most difficult courses in the world: what do human mules with kavakh-igena.

Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accused career, stress and prices for housing and education in the absence of the children.
"the people of Singapore need to grow."
My husband Patriot, you're my wife patriotka to fulfill our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising мятных loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of it - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying something like "let's suppose Bao (булку) in the stove," to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.
The advertising agency, which has made this video, BBH to entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to this problem in the form of entertainment.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to people have done, "its national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we have to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world according to reproduce their kind, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government tried to do much, for example, to launch the spirits with pheromones or organize parties quick singles (blitz-visits).
Many of these ideas, perhaps, were creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing of the possible to solve this problem, namely compose rap?
The child 1.2
Who do not take it so lightly, so this is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on politics for the enthusiasm of the citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, prolonging pregnancy and maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But all this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state-city in south-east Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his strict public control.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national management of the population, is now at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children? "
Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the National Office of population, says that the reason that "improved education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"this allowed people to have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the growth in the number of Bachelorette and long delays of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which seeks to reduce immigration to counter a sharp increase in population, causing outrage among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites where thrives barely concealed xenophobia in respect of many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, which he criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that last year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in elections since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
The unexpected consequences
While the fall in fertility has a certain influence on the economic growth of the nation's tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to be built so many small housing.
For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that you can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters are sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is a belief that they can contribute holostomu lifestyle and deprive the incentive to developers who want to build a big family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, general director of the company showed El developers, says that their "boxes of shoes" sold much faster than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sold for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow increasing.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, who earlier put obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Is too perenapryazhennye
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking with singaporians who work in the financial district of the city, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"people are very stretched, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people this delay," said a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"but for me it's important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and prices for housing and education as factors that hinder them to have children.
So, how would the government nor even encourage their citizens to the birth of children, when it comes to childbearing, the final word rests with singaporians.

Personal in the offline - personal online
The privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, talking about private property, or the "sphere of privacy, which have the right to defend against any interference."
That is a personal for a minor under 16 years?
As he uses this definition in their daily lives and in the social networks?
Whether he understands the danger, which is under discussion in the Internet situations, which would certainly not shared outside the Internet?
Elperiodico took an interview with five guys from 10 to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they were associated with the term "something very my," in a private plane, and "password and username" when applied to social networks.
"my biggest secrets I would not be downloaded in the post," said Jorge 10, when trying to explain the importance of personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"this is a very sensitive secrets, my mother can they know, but not the whole world," he says.
The FB I load the beautiful pictures or pictures from the Games.
Also I play with their friends.
"I would not have shared photo, which is not my, or someone who behaves silly," he says.
The boy realizes that bad publishing obscene photographs of naked people who write abusive or violent crimes or comments.
Jorge assures that knows 35 friends who had been in the FB, and nine of their folloverov on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother in the course, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express themselves and to write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if I am, I only their load," he adds.
"the social network" fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with their friends-quick, "he says.
Without thinking, is that he never received a request from unfamiliar faces.
Wouldn't be with someone who recommended that the stranger.
The case of the 14-year-old Jose is.
The teenager is open accounts at Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, and in the latest admits that he did not know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"it doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one to him not utiralsya in confidence and not asked his home address or phone number.
"if there will be pressure on me or anything, just to remove them from their account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
One friend of my girlfriend blackmailed into the social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"he never found out who it was," he said.
The victim, according to Jose, not deleted account.
"only included confidentiality."
Then he explains the sequence of steps to account settings in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have uploaded photos or confuznyh acquaintances in uncomfortable situations.
Yes, I would have done it, if people don't like me or if I want to do this.
"although I know that this cybermobbing," he confirms it.
The key questions
Marjelos Porras, who teaches English and expert on education and training, said that in order to send children and teenagers, need to understand that the goal of social networks - to inform.
"the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Porras indicates that Professor Mark prenski, Master of Education from Yale University and the author of the work of digital natives and immigrants who invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
The digital natives that they, children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
"we digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning to themselves," she said.
Explains that this issue is complex, "because we have certain criteria we ask them what they can or can't distribute, publish or speak, in an age when not mature enough to do that."
"also they were selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what the privacy of children and adolescents, "ask questions that make them think.
"tell them that they don't do this, useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you're not told a stranger, so why do you do on the Internet?
Or, you would have liked, if published a photo of you like that, that you published about his friend?
Do you know that others publish about you? "
When you sign photos with the parties, ask whether you're letting other people to celebrate their?
And another, all I need to know, what are you doing in every moment?
Another option is to give them to understand that they must behave online just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"outside of the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, so it should be on social networks," she said.
The vigilance of
Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains that the heads of families conscientiously read the policy of social networks.
Understanding each of the items, they have good reason to talk with children about the preconditions for opening an account on the Internet.
"for example, age and what is allowed to broadcast or publish," he says.
According to the cycle, the key question is to remind children a lesson "don't talk to strangers."

"South America must learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans "killing each other during the second world war" and in other clashes, "but now they are almost one fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the draft of the establishment of American citizenship, which favor UNASUR countries.
"it is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president showed himself, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the prerequisite for reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, the South Americans, by contrast, sign it.
"inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington and financed by the United States," he said, hinting at the political asylum given Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said that he did not regret the decision, because with him he not betraying their principles, and follow their "deepest values of democracy and human rights."
He added that in his time, "there were some suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country, and will not be respected the process."
He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to come into its territory for questioning about the alleged crimes of sexual violence, while "the Swedish law considers possible to carry him through videoconferencing, which could make the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
What really is, so this is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health of confined in a small space without the ability to do exercises on the air.
"it affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing guarantees of immunity, which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that there were talks in London on the search for solutions to the problems in the confines of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating about human rights, it is a word we have in this case do not use, but there were constant debate.
"the solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because the lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzon, leads a number of processes in various European authorities," he said.
And argued that "if Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as it allows its legislation and how well it has done in other cases, will be examined by Senor Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or be examined him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that it "does not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression."
"the enemies of freedom of the press is not corrupted villains-policy, and bad journalists, supporting profits, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained satisfied that none of these journalists, "neither bankers nor the bourgeois countries-hegemons does not dominate in Ecuador," and added that being reelected, "deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also backed the decision to retain veto Paraguay in Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and will not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of legality," because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president considers, moreover, "perfectly legitimate" desire to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos lead now talks with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after a decision by the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which turned out to be in favor of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not respected.
Is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
Need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good end to the dispute about the sea borders, which are in the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that "the right thing for Latin America to apply to the international court, if the two countries agree to accept the decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
Regarding the ability to stand as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, though sometimes it's pretty hard."
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, then will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be fixed only by political power.
"my political movement considered that I guaranteed the probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.

If we lose, the same thing.

The death rate from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"I was like a stunned," he recalls that difficult, despite all the rhythm of the doctor's time.
The young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease itself, he wanted to know about it as much as possible, and his efforts to materialize - he has already said his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients are HIV-branch hospital hospital civil de Guadalajara (hCG), where he came in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives with the diagnosis "of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe when there are too few treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased treated patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he was cut."
In other words, in those days have AIDS was the sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without worsening the quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, until now, many people come, when the virus has been damaged, "drained" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of patients who began treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the Department of HIV-positive hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information is confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the best expected life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when reports about 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years old," he explained.
To assess this progress, we should remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in халиско 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May this year; nevertheless, argues that there is a ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
"why is still there are deaths?
"personally, I think that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I imagine, so the case in our hospital.
At least for the past 12 years, we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because you don't know about his infitirovannom condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He cited the devastating data: "nine out of ten patients come when we already have some opportunisticeskaya infection; what you need to do to exert more influence on the overall mortality rate, so it is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who are asked."
In his proposal, agree experts and officials of the State Council on the prevention of AIDS in халиско (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory for testing, motivated by the fact that it made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already on the stage of AIDS and even suffered саркомой sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some people think that will die, and don't want to know.
"times are still die, the better I'll nadiratsya three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I nourish myself, doing exercises, take drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, take an active sex life, but with a shared responsibility to take care of yourself and of another person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal lives with Milenio Jalisco, to encourage its statement of those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, experiencing fear.
Let checked, if there was a risk of infection, even as soon as possible to know whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other people, being responsible.
It is his message said the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
The counter condoms
Big gap between programs in health and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who started a problem associated with HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places, dedicated to this task, "actually increased distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, we now offer packages to 100, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still do not have access to condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"why would they do?" is a popular issue, with echidstvo and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured the advocate.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for the mystery and that hundreds of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places that are often visited by young people.
It is not encourage promiscuity.
We are not talking about the payment of beer and motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked, is distributing condoms under his leadership.
"it's not sexy, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
The key data халиско
13,435 (12,158 total reported cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317).
The state ranks 4th place in the national rankings on new and cumulative cases of AIDS and the 13-th on HIV.
92 percent of the infections are related to sexual way, 6 percent through blood and 2% to perinatalism path.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, because on the one known case there are four to five people who don't know about it.

Given the ratification of the United States Court of Appeals decision that elides debt restructuring group Vitro garnered through competitive production in Mexico, the script sets the fatal precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country, which has a solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of the firms that дозволены Mexican laws, are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In practice, the approval of a decision on June 15, Judge speaking Hale bankruptcies in the Court of the Northern District of Texas, leaves vulnerable Mexican firms in the face of a possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, causing three inconsistencies in the evidence.
As the entry, while the judge in the case said that lenders should be regulated by the U.S. bankruptcy code, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, located in New Orleans, says that the main trial for competitive manufacture, considered in Mexico.
The first item involves the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational profile.
In fact, the model law was created by the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, defining as an arbiter of the American Institute of Law.
Second, the verdict establishes that without межфирменного voting, acknowledged in a critical mass of competitive manufacture of debt, which had before the parent company affiliates Vitro, there would have been no majority required for the approval of the restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity to recognize the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that the accepted this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, among which agremex and comercial Mexicana, whose mezhfirmennye debts guaranteed Federal Institute of competitive industries.
It is also true that subtracting the voices of branches, one way or another Vitro creditors who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds "vultures" like aurelios capital, aurelios way, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, does not have a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
These data appeals court drops.
On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with whom she has faced since 2008, serious concern the economic crisis that faced the United States, causing strikes across the country.
So far, the company would appeal the decision of the Gonzalez family garden in the Court of Appeals to vote came to him the plenum, i.e., the five judges, due to the fact that only three votes.
The petition will be charged in the case of lack of identity, which would require a review of the process by the Court of Appeals, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of ewcs curiae ("friend of the court"), in which he described the process, which should be Vitro within the framework of the law on competitive industry, signaling that he frees himself from the implementation of the agreements, signed by both countries to associate her with Article 15 of the law of the United States bankruptcy.
In addition, noted that the country is bowing to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules set for interstate cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Italy from the two boards: they beat in vitro and beaten in the country.

Hector "khetin" Reyes: "basketball has been my life."
Avid basketball traveler Hector "khetin" Reyes was more than 60 years is associated with this sport and, thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico stores in memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector "khetin" Reyes.
And after all, before a brain haemorrhage приковало him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player in small groups, a player of the highest basketball league, the commissioner and head of the BSN with suppose bayamona and president of basketball federation.
"I've done a lot of roles in basketball over the course of his life, including several at once, as when I was president of BSN, director general of the national team and president of the Federation in the 90-s," recalls Reyes during a visit to his home in the Primera Hora Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"basketball has been my life."
Reyes was not exaggerating, making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things gathered for his long way to testify about it.
The heart Bayamon
With the largest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old, his performances in the role of co-agent or agent contract.
"it was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be part of the Cowboys eight championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year the debut of Jerome Minsky BSN.
Since then, and continue to lead became "kuko" Ortiz, who was a great manager, "said Reyes.
I remember that, Jean bartov, who arrived here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you, there is a very strong player, rising 6 '7."
"do you want?"
And it was the beginning of a Minsky, one of the best players, who were in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended that the sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and has become one of our best scorers.
I remember that said that if Minsky brought a championship Bayamon, гаусс helped to win another one.
With the Cowboys championstv Gauss I enjoyed, but at a distance, because in 1988, has been portrayed as the chief of the Federation.
By the time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments Minsky in the national team.
Remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we have got the fourth place and it was supposed to be a bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
The team with the World Cup in 1990, is the best team, what you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my favorite was the one with the plays in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won a bronze at the World Championships.
The team not only once again played Minsky, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, FICO Lopez and 'pikulina' (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) 'tonito' colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'кихоте' Morales, who failed to participate in a 90 year because of a knee injury.
The team, which probably wasn't the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us to a gold medal and a great joy, was the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament of 1995 in неукене, Argentina.
With role players like 'kanito' nyevsa, Pablo alisea and young Rolando hurruitner instead of players, temporarily estranged for the mess panamericansk championship in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? "
Without any doubt, it was pikulin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico does not dominate at this level as it did pikulin.
And that is without his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best puertoricancem head?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young men, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalma, armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like the work Leo arill.
What do you think your greatest achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was to 17 teams in a season.
What do you need to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now guys travel and play too much, and it's unnecessarily.
At least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and training for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
Now what are you doing?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoying his grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoying the company of my wife, icabel, which has always been with me.

His work included roles in the film, well-received by critics, "the group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his workshop interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. led Hagman on top of glory.
CBS drama series about the clan ewingov and other characters in his entourage went on the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?," conceived to create hype around episode, full of emotion, in which a character Hagman nearly killed, spawned international discussion and millions of dollars, which risked in tennis.

The course, which examines the "end of the world."
Every week, students study the apocalyptic phenomena, such as a nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharm decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had irresistible lure: the end of a long "Countdown" the Mayan calendar, December 21, for which many people seized as evidence that heralded the end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea that he was expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "dolgoarmageddonom," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where the end times Christian theorists believe that will start the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this will be the most an apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week to students at Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we are left with only 30 days, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic thinking.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically last in history.
In templsk University associate professor Barry Wacker reads the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students study the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"we analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way that offer a hypothetical scenarios that cause certain acts of man.
If the nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, could hit the war.
This month, the students analyzed films on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples from real life.
"I tried to tell students that maybe, probably, plausible and impossible," said Wacker.
The main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America and his colleague Matthew Restall Amara солари, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is called simply "the end of the world."
"we do not add '2012' to always be able to read the course again, in case the end of the world will not come," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent destruction," students should learn to cook projects and take final exams.
In the Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse that does not leave students with no choice but to work "to the same night, in which presumably will come the end of the world," said Restall.
Courses have proved quite popular.
"designated ended for two hours," said Restall about its course for students with the highest average scores, which signed 35 students.
We have received e-mail for weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked, are there still places.
The students, in turn, to assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch that make people to console themselves," said Brigid Robinson, 23-year-old student of the Department of Sociology of religion and Haddonfield, of New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And the image of an apocalyptic thoughts, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or his absence.
Will vecoesa, 25-year-old student of the department of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard about the deal, which would have been taught to this," he said.
He like me.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor - not said that he believes in the doomsday date of December 21.
"our first project touched Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we are his discredited," said Julie zeglen, 21-year-old student last year in templsk University of West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there are apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people react to changes around himself, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"in other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Predominantly in anglogovoryaschem world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to a question about whether he knew any well-informed about the "end of the world" there.
"the Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the disposal of the appeal.
We have a pardon from the pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time about many of the last days of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
The students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some said that they are going to go to parties, "the end of the world."
"maybe, call someone from friends to laugh together," said Samir Ford, 20-year-old student at the Faculty of communication.
