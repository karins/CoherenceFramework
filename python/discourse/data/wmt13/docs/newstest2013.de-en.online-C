A republican strategy in order to confront the re-election of Obama
The managements of the republicans justify its politics with the necessity, to fight the choice fraud.
To be sure the Brennan center latter considers to be a myth in that it strengthens, that the choice fraud more rarely is in the USA than the amount of the person killed by the lightning strike.
The lawyers of the republicans indicated only 300 cases of choice fraud in 10 years in the USA by the way.
One is certain: these new determinations will affect negatively the voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partially the democratic system of the USA.
In contrast to Canada, the US states is responsible for the execution of the choices in the single countries.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments announced since 2009 new laws, that impede the procedure for the registration or the going to the polls.
This phenomenon became more meaningful after the choices of the November 2010, with which 675 new republican representatives in 26 countries could be indicated.
As a result 180 bill were introduced alone in 2011, that restrict the execution of the right to vote in 41 countries.
The new choice laws demand that the voters produce a photo identification card and a proof of the US country citizenry.
In addition the periods are shortened through these laws also for the premature voting, arranged that declares right to be invalidly to register themselves at the election day as a voter, and citizens the right to vote, for which a court document exists.
Before the choices of 2006, no US country of the voters demanded to show a photo identification card.
Indiana was the first state that raised such a demand.
The colonel court of the United States confirmed the constitution temperance of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The republican authorities hurried to expand this practice to other countries.
In the course of the last two year, they promoted in 34 states of bill, with which the voters are forced to show a photo identification card.
It importantly is to be noticed in that the US citizens does not control in contrast to Quebec an universal identification card card such as the health insurance card.
In the deed possess 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million entitled to vote people no photo identification card issued by a government authority its country.
In addition five million reelections in 2012 do not control such an identification card.
To be sure more are to be paid frequently than hundred dollars in order to received the required identification card.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minority and people with low income disproportionately strongly are concerned.
In the deed, $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years do not control 25% of the Afro Americans, 15% of the people with an income of less than the required photo identification card.
This passes along yet.
It the student, whom are not looked at as a voter, whom deliver its voice increased for democratic candidates, is permitted in several countries to use its photo identification card issued by its arrangement.
On the other hand the same countries permit it members of hinge society or hunt society, who select more strongly for the republican side, to use the cards issued by these societies for choices.
Before 2004, no state demanded for the selecting a proof of the country citizenry.
Arizona was the first state that introduced such a demand.
Since 2011 dismissed a dozen of countries of laws, that demand of the voters, that they prove its US country citizenry.
These measures aim clearly on that to limit the hispanischen voices.
For it lies on the hand that two of three hispanischen voters that democratic party prefer.
In addition republican legislators 2011 in eight states of laws promoted, with whom the registration was abolished by voters at the election day.
In addition you restricted the right of individual and groups to perform those voters aid position, that would like to register itself.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example the campaigns to the voter registration contributed in the general choices 2004 in addition, ca. To register 10 millions of citizen.
For through the measures dismissed since 2009, the share of the registration by reelections 2010 in comparison with 2006 diminished itself around 17%.
Moreover the republican legislators in five further states of laws dismissed, who aim on that to shorten the period for the premature voting.
For example were in the general choices 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters, that selected in advance, Afro American although they settle only 13% of the voters of the state.
Same applies to the hispanische population.
Latter only 11% of the voters settled, but 24% of the citizens that selected in advance.
In contrast to that the white that represented 76% of the voters settled, only 46% of the voters, that selected in advance.
Naturally the democratic legislators and its followers opposed vigorously the dismissal of laws, that the registrations of the voters restrict.
Several bill were blocked through the vetos of the democratic governors.
The general lawyer of the USA interfered in order to stop the most disputed laws.
They partially were able to limit the damages.
For example only 16 of the 34 states of laws dismissed, that demand the showing of a photo identification card.
To be sure the newly introduced rules in 2012 will impede undoubtedly the execution of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the dismissed laws and see the influence of the results in that in them as a clear goal for 2012 decisive countries.
A report of the Brennan of center of 2011 shows that those countries that dismissed these laws to win 171 of the 270 voices settle, that are required in the delegate group, around the presidency.
It is too early in order to confirm with certainty that these changes of the legal specifications will have at the choice system considerable effects on the result of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is certain: these new determinations will affect negatively the voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partially the democratic system of the USA.

Should prostate cancer early recognition: the test be made or not?
The PSA test wise results defective in the deed sometimes up, with incorrect negative or however also incorrect positive results, that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to stronger hesitation of the already irresolute men for the execution of early recognition tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We overtook the opinion of two specialty physicians.
In the studies carried out in the USA, numerous disruptive influences between the control groups existed so that it is difficult to interpret these data and to give unambiguous recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference exists in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study showed also that in an after observation after 12 years the probability of the development of metastases is 30 to 40% higher around, if no early recognition was carried out.
Therefore I recommend the test from an age of 50 years and/or 40 years if one has a direct relative, who had become ill already with prostate cancer.
With men of afro American origin, a higher risk exists also.
The most important is, to make the correct decision as soon as a cancer disease was recognized.
There are cancer types, that aggressively and other that are indolent.
The size of the risk of its cancer disease really intelligibly must be made the patient in that it the possible options are shown, with which Prostatakrebse untreated can remain, if he does not impair the quality of life in the long run, and decides one in these cases sooner on an active supervision of the illness.
Today takes place at many men, with whom one recognized cancer, no treatment because its cancer is not aggressively and represents no threat for its life.
One proposes them an active supervision and offers in advancing of the illness a treatment to them.
One certainly with increasing accuracy the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who not.
Therefore I recommend nevertheless the execution of the test.
Most importantly it is not however, to speak with its physician, in order to determine whether he should be carried out or.
In collaboration with the international company for Urologie, Movember developed an instrument, with which it is possible to value the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Preventing of the illness
Unfortunately there is no miracle means to the prevention of cancer.
In spite of the progress in the research, the acceptance of a healthy way of life remains the best way in order to diminish the risk, to become ill with it.
It is appreciated that 30% of the cancer diseases could be prevented, if everyone would eat well and would move sufficiently.
"If it no more smoker would give, would become this value at least on 50% increase", emphasizes André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer company.
To be sure is assumed that about 10% of the cancer diseases are caused by transmission.
Several remain also totally unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer company, the battle against the tobacco dependence remains a priority, in spite of the decline of the number of the smoker.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancer types.
The health of the people damages strongly.
"Today yet gives it in Quebec 1.5 million of smoker", regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the renunciation of the cigarette to die diminished itself the risk at cancer around the half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian cancer company, excess weight and Adipositas promote also the outbreak of the illness.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, Grimmdarm-, rectum cancer, esophagus cancer, pancreas cancer and uterus cancer.
"The research shows, that a regular physical activity during the entire life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects", joins it thereto.
The nourishment
The organization recommends also to limit the consumption of red meat.
In to large quantity it increases the risk to become ill with a Grimm- and/or mast intenstinal cancer.
Sausage products should be avoided also.
The preservation of meat through smoking, drying or salts can lead to the development of carcinogenic.
"Latter can the somatic cells damage and to the development of cancer lead", explains it.
Vitamins
In the last years, several scientists examined the context between vitamin additions and cancer.
Your investigations are however presently not conclusive.
After the Canadian cancer company, the studies to vitamin E are contradictory.
While a study found out the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed sooner an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was shown also not yet clearly.
In addition Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is, to speak with its physician over its objections and its informal encumbrance.
"The execution of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer".

The Higgs Boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs Bosons excited a certain sensation in the last summer, and this for good reason.
One believes in the deed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than at the mechanism, that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And in the end it concerns observed became the last particle, whose existence of the standard model - our best or "at the least incorrect" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but empirically not yet.
But for the physicists, it is not certain yet complete that it concerns really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it strongly resembles the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition this seems confirmed through new data to become, that were introduced in this week on a large physics congress in Kyoto, but yet data are missing in order to be certain about that perfect.
Let's assume nevertheless that it concerns actually the Higgs, because apparently only a slight risk exists to be mistaken, and let's regard us, around which it goes.
There is in this world an inevitably indispensable law that causes, that two objects cannot be simultaneous at the same place available.
It is not possible to violated this rule - and do not try it too strongly because you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, turns out that for it also such a law counts: the Pauli' sche from end principle that purports, that two particles cannot occupy the same room to the same time, if they are in the same "quantum condition", whereby this "condition" consists in the large and entire of some of its characteristics.
Therefrom outgoing the physicists divide the particles in two categories.
In a corner, the good citizens, who are designated as a Fermione and obey good the Pauli principle, are.
And in the other, the Bosonen, a vile volume of anarchist move is holy, which nothing - in any case not this principle what means, that they can be in the deed to the same time at the same place.
These Bosonen subdivide itself in accordance with the web page The Particle Advent original of the Berkeley laboratories (that by the way absolutely astonishingly is) in two groups: the Mesonen that we will not treat here and the "power particles", through which the large powers of nature spread and with which the Higgs Boson would be used somehow.
It must be emphasized here however that these Bosonen are not all so exotic creatures, how one could mean.
If you are in a position to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a Bosons of extraordinary banality: the Photon or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic power.
If namely a particle with an electric load accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field becomes "disturbed" exactly at this place, in about like a pebble stone, that was thrown into a pond.
Through this "interference", an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared radiation or ultraviolet radiation etc.) emerges, and this wave is nothing but a Photon and therefore one of the Bosonen "carriers of the power".
More stable field
Same applies to the Higgs Boson, with which difference that another field, that must "disturbed" become Higgs field, appears, so that this Boson.
To be sure the Higgs field is very much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a few comparably with a frozen pond, whose surface could become only of a very large rock furrowed.
Therefore a gigantic particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! To reach - around such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in order to explain the relation between the Higgs and the mass.
All particles are not in the deed and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like Magnete, this do, but other not - for example a piece of paper never would become of even at the refrigerator hold.
And likewise all particles with the Higgs field do not interact possess: that that do it, a mass while the other (like by the way the Photon) possess no mass.
For what do all these researches can now "be good", asks woman Plamondon?
For the science, they serve the examination of the standard model (SM), and they enable the physicists also to examine all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM exactly.
There are by the way numerous physicists who hope longingest, that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and some holes of the model could plug.
One must say that latter yet large deficiencies shows, because it no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter offers, that ca. 80% of matter of the universe forms (again ups!).
To be sure such deviations were not found in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these researches for the general population are to be predicted more hard, but it could be supposed incorrectly that there would be none.
By the way: in the early '60's the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not assume that its works such a revolution would release.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else further.
In the deed developed already said the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - that in the Bell live worked has, in which the laser in the '1960's invented became, and that 1962 itself the first duration stroke laser (the first were gepulst) - to us that the laser was looked at at the beginning sooner than a "laboratory to be played".
Stand before...
Moreover applications can result also from all the instruments, that surround the research.
For example Willard Boyle 1969 developed again a small light sensor during its works in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor serves today all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and brought in it 2009 the Nobel Prize for physics.
Naturally this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change inevitably our life, but means it, that one it really never know can...

To die palliative care - the best way... | Le Devoir
With its from shot for "dying in would become" has Quebec recently the delicate question the end of life discusses.
The debate must be received briefly again although a bill is prepared.
To be sure yet much to do remains in this important subject area.
Le Devoir tried to observe this more closely.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived yet alone in its dwelling in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed it had let it a time period of two years.
"You gave me five years to live, I have seven years created", said it half-hearted, in its bed in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil lying, in which it had arrived on the day before.
"To be sure is it always a shock, on that can one not prepared be", says it.
The illness makes its work: an immense weakness prevents it on that, however to go on the toilet and to eat even even.
At the table before a delicious lunch sitting, willigt he resigns on to be helped in the meal.
Courageous it succeeds to smile it even and bring offer to speak with the strange, that are busied around it around, its medicines, and it a bath to it.
The courage of the usual death.
"My largest wish is it, that one my diarrhea heals, because this humbling is", divides it with.
A few hours later the team found a remedy for this evil.
"In the course of our life learn we, that a man in the standing pees", tells Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home Victor Gadbois.
To return into the childhood phase an unacceptable humiliation is for certain people.
"That hangs of the capacity of the person from" to accept a setback, places it firmly.
For in the opinion of several people that work in the palliative care, large events take place in the middle of this setback.
The patients, who are instructed into the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, suffer all from cancer.
They have a maximal life expectancy of three months.
In this stage, they will bombard of the physicians and nurse, who attend to it, no longer with so named "healing" cares.
For woman A., 89 years,, the worst fear is, to die "deliberately and through asphyxiation".
But through the illness, I have really know learned my children.
"I have good children", joins it thereto.
"I have no more wishes in life", says it before it accepts, that one mounts it a costume, that helps its in the breathing.
It expects in the next days nevertheless another last visit of its son that comes from Italy.
In the home Victor Gadbois, one offers body care and aid position with a group of volunteer in the nourishment reception.
The palliative care is used then if it gives no more other possibilities.
In order to form the dying more comfortably.
In Quebec, a bed comes on 11,700 inhabitants for the palliative care.
That is very few if one are considered, that we will die one day everyone.
Here life is continued under optimum conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on plain of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One grants the dying according to wish a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics must control its blood-sugar level no longer.
And death is part of the everyday life.
We served yesterday evening Mr. X a beer, that died in the course of the night.
Today morning will be finish son the beer on foot the deceased.
"We help member and patients likewise", reports care director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor Gadbois, no day is such as the other.
Next to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is supported well of its pillows, while one activates to its honors, dies a young man of 36 years, that is surrounded by his parents, his wife and both small children, in tragic manner after he tried everything in order to survive.
"Since six months are three to five beds always with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years covers", divides disturbs Dr. Christiane Martel with.
53% of the patient instructed into the home Victor Gadbois come come by its accustomed site, 47% out of the hospital.
Problem of the access to the palliative care
One says, have, i.e. to a care, that 77% of the Canadians no access to the palliative care, that should mitigate the suffering of patients, if latter the final stage of its life reached, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, like the home Victor Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative care in the greater Montreal area specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this large insufficiency in the health provision of Quebec provides that several physicians specialized in the palliative care of the dismissal of a law to the regulation by medically assisted suicide and assisted suicide with objection expect.
For the month of October a manifesto in the circulation, that of prominent personalities of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe became signs, has been in order to manifest its contradiction to such an initiative.
Dr. according to Christiane Martel the health system of Quebec is not efficient enough in order to guarantee that all rights have on a qualitatively high-value palliative care, before one accepts to pass over to the medically assisted suicide.
Recently, says it, I saw a patient, who was 14 days with large pain in the emergency ward, without that one seized measures to its relief.
I fear that the patients want to die only therefore, because they receive no appropriate health provision.
And simultaneously several oncologists treat stifled its patients in spite of worst prognoses to the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when it interrupted an onerous chemotherapy.
When I announced my Onkologin, that I will interrupt the treatment, it answered me that it would regret, that I abandon the battle, told it.
To be sure it had said to me that I would be at the end!
No omnipotente care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients to die asked have, that, that care personnel thank, that it did not grant this wish, after its pains were mitigated of a team of the palliative care.
It must be said however clearly that the palliative care is not in the pain treatment omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, leader of the palliative care of the company the domestic palliative care of the greater Montreal area do not address 8% of the patients on a pain treatment.
Entirely at the end of life, the physicians fall back therefore frequently on the terminale sedation, that runs out on that to put to sleep the patient either sporadic or durably until at the time its death.
We cannot do more long so as if we do not perceive this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will have always more frequently the possibility to fall back on this terminale sedation.
Patients whose pains are not mitigated say all the same sentence: "I want to die".
But that does not mean inevitably, "I wants, that you me put to sleep", but rather "I would like that my pains become" mitigated.
The realization of this report was possible based on a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.

Real estate scandals of large size in Quebec
Official of the street department of building and inspection, business of the building head business, Geldbeschaffer of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day, what they know over a magnificent "system", in which building trade, official, politician, labor union and Mafioso are entangled.
An "industry", that was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990 and '2000's.
"It is remarkable, how the system decomposes, since one drastic measures seized has", quips Jacques Duchesneau, delegate in Quebec and former leader of the police of Montreal.
The scandal was uncovered through it based on a detailed investigation of the embezzlement in the context with the contracts to street structural work in Quebec, with which the at that time prime minister had agreed only reluctant.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of official.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010", emphasizes it," would have alone the transportation ministry a billion of dollar at the contracts saved", for some zügelten at the same time its instinct in order to receive its share!
The Charbonneau commission "has already two mayors to case brought", adds he, in the hope that it you succeed, "the tactics behind the individuals to show".
A 2011 established, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit
The 2011 established, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit undertakes also large exertions with its troops at accountants, determining and analyst of the government.
Moreover the policemen of the "Marteau troop" who caused since 2009 that the "sewer system cartel" of Montreal in the artificial distension of the contracts more reserved advances...
In that, it last week undertook in rows house searches and raised accusation because of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate carriers such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, that mayor of a suburb is.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, that just of its office as a mayor of Laval, who resigned third largest cities of Quebec.
It is suspected to have accepted in the exchange for public orders repeatedly bribes.
Specifically accused became engineer the street department of building and inspection of Montreal by the way, as well as entrepreneur Italian origin, like Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
More latter sensation excited in that it declared the functional method of the "system" of orders public to be the receipt to the commission.
He himself paid several years long 3% of the value of the contracts preserved in Montreal at a mediator standing with the mafia in connection, that transmitted the money at the union to Montreal, the party by mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had in the '2000's everywhere its hand in the game in that he more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (ca. 68,000 Euro) at province parties gave, been above all at that at that time at the power liberal.
It confessed also to have organized an illegal means procurement for the former liberal vice president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer system contracts whose costs artificially were swelled of it
In Montreal, the "system" of the corruption functioned smooth.
The former building engineer Gilles Surprenant described this before the commission in detail: in ten years, he received restaurants and ice hockey games of the building business of gifts, invitations to trips, gulf tournament,, as well as bribe in the amount of 736,000 dollars as a return service for sewer system contracts whose costs he artificially swelled.
Other officials of the street department of building and inspection admitted that they let grease itself, in that they swelled the calculations with incorrect additional achievements artificially around 30-40%.
Moreover an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he overlooked intentionally a shadow household, that filled its cash registers with black money.
As a result of these uncovering, Mr. Tremblay beginning November resigned, what fell Montreal into a heavy crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first delegates of Montreal, that raised the alarm.
As a mayor of the city district Rivière-the-Prairies, in the East of the island, resisted further sells became itself it from 2010 against the sale of a community plot of land that for 5 million dollars acquired and for 1.6 million at building carrier in the booming real-estate market.
70% Black money in the choice campaigns
Of the investigation, that is carried out in the end, it says that it pulls "at a thread, that enables it, the functional method the of ants infiltrated to understand system, in order to stop the evil and to denounce" the indebted.
It says that the procedure would be "painful, but positive".
We are there, to clean the wound, bräuchten to be sure an ascertainment unit certain only for Montreal, as well as a supervision in order to prevent a return of the doubtful practices.
How one cleanly makes.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notices in for its part that "official several hundreds of millions dollar stolen have", thinks however above all about the roll of that "mandate carrier, that over the tactic in the picture are" if they were not involved into the fraud!
Come from a share of 70% black money in the financing of the choice campaign in Quebec it quips: Was said to "me that these would be" only a weak copy of the reality.
The government of Quebec proposes to restrict the contributions at parties on 100 dollars, what would change it according to nothing at the situation: "As long as the campaign editions are not limited exertally, black money in the politics in the circulation will be".
It recommends a complete revision of the system of orders public for the award and the financing of the parties: "We not more deeply can fall; in that we go the things with courage on the reason, we can construct" the house on a more solid basis with more inspections and laws again.
If this story damages the international appearance of Quebec and that of Montreal, demands Mr. Duchesneau of that up, that laugh about that to throw a view into its own backyard...

"PSG is not the FC Barcelona"!
In this season, you supposed a new size with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Magnificent players came.
Daily I make at its side of progress.
The technical personnel gave me also much.
These elements spur me every day in addition on to improve my game level.
And in a game, this is even simpler.
In the soccer, all goes very quickly.
But I do not break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginning in the center of the preparing education of the INF Clairefontaine to my game time in Saint Etienne, I made always gradually progress.
They take advantage of therefore the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this in the summer are accustomed on that to expedite games of level very high.
They know also that each training unit is decisive.
This leads in addition that a player such as I who must offer forehead and wants to give be best.
By the way gives me Carlo Ancelotti much with regard to my game position.
It is supported of Co trainers such as Claude Makelele, played that on the same position like I.
Is Ancelotti the correct person for the task?
Obvious.
Ancelotti infuses all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is presently no comparable person, and it is among the best trainers of Europe.
It looks back on a rich experience and won many titles with esteemed societies.
It had contact with large players.
I think that it will win further titles in Paris.
In January I led an encouraging conversation with it.
At that time I had recovered just of an injury series.
The confidence that it set in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think over the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the frontrunner.
We lurk however in the ambush.
One our most important goals is qualified us the champions League: we in this manner for the round of sixteen.
What is the goal of the society in this competition?
We will try to come as far as possible.
From now on all is possible.
To be sure we will have to have our little word against very good European teams a say.
First of all we want to become first our group before postage so that we can expedite the return match of the round of sixteen than a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European society on short visibility?
It has already the budget for that...
Around a large European society to become, must win Paris title and make itself long-termed a name.
This is not today the case.
Financially the PSG gives itself the means so that this intention supposes concrete forms.
Would it be a large fiasco to not to win the title in the Ligue 1 how this was in the last season the case?
This would be natural a large disappointment.
This year is far off long us it really at the heart, this title.
In the last season, we were thickly at it.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough, around the victory report therefrom.
We concluded the season with a very strong achievement.
We locked with 79 points.
Normally one should be with 79 points master...
But another team, that of Montpellier, obtained an even better season.
I believe that this year is the correct.
Also if the large teams such as Marseille struggle, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have the thing in addition to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG?
In consideration its, what is invests become and the players whom we have, it is normal that much is expected by us.
We accept that perfectly.
If we win to be sure in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and one finds still something, what one can reproach for us, that with security is somewhat frustrating.
One ask himself, what the people yet expect.
We never could win each weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a game draft.
A team builds up gradually.
In the champions League, we proved strength.
Do not observe Manchester city, a society of that since two seasons creates to qualify for the round of sixteen, and the editions also gigantic handled has!
With regard to the invested sums, one believed you to the game recess with 15 points advantage!
That is that our opponents and the French championship except respect would be let.
Lyon and Marseille, that were not good in the last season, became of this new PSG "geboostet".
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May the smiling victor and say ourselves that we won it in spite of all difficulties in the end.
The PSG seems to be completely of the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic dependent.
All the more better, that one speaks about a "Zlatan dependence".
That is that Ibrahimovic high-performance is and shoots many gates.
Therefore it came and proves it that it is the star of the Ligue 1.
Where it played, it brought to the attention of that it is a magnificent player and a world star.
Within the team, we both the player and the person respect.
It respects also the people who surround it.
What it performed, is really extraordinary.
This spornt the other on to improve its game level.
Thiago Silva, that worldwide one of the best defenders is, enables it all other also to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
How a disappointment.
It lay me at the heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately prevented me my injury on that to knock something game time out.
I saw there things, out of which I followed strengthened.
Today it succeeds me to realize good games in the national team.
This was since my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
Out of that, what happened in the Ukraine, we pulled our apprenticeship, and today we must put an exemplary behavior at the day.
Which opinion do you have to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the tip of the "Bleus"?
It reached very promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strict, stands the players nearly and moves to the victory on.
How it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to engage no comparison.
Blanc had reached its goal in that it had qualified us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does that represent at the 16th of October in Spain forced undecided (1:1) a prelude game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone supported everyone others.
Before this coincidence in Spain, I experienced never a comparable game in my career.

With Bitcoin, paying and selling is possible without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the base of central banks, identified transaction and handling charges between the participant.
In addition a political vision is tangible like so often in these technologies: the conviction that the current, of bank monopoly monetary system formed leads, to finance crises.
In the deed, that of Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is certain invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (however in dollar, Euro etc. convertible) and a protocol for the exchange such as BitTorrent, that enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, already about 200,000 transactions were grasped.
Some thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as a contribution or as a currency.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 had peakd an of 30 dollars (23 Euro), he fell five months later on 2 dollars before he has himself today on approximately ten dollar recovered (the courses are on the web page bitcoincharts. com itemized).
Nothing especially impressive in comparison with the international trade of real currencies or finance products.
Nevertheless the European central bank (EZB) in a report published in October showed interest on virtual currencies for this.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the largest success", "in the competition with the dollar or Euro" and "similarly to to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs win or buy can of other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits", that are used in order to make headway in a video-game, that one through games (and sometimes also trade back).
The social network Facebook developed also such a system.
To be sure the trade is controlled each time of a central authority and is processed.
With Bitcoin, all network knots Verwahrer are simultaneous the calculation book, inspector, money Emittenten as well as buyer and salesman.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two e-mail addresses in form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can select another address for each payment, what guarantees the anonymity.
A row of the data standing with this transaction in context is signed electronically by a double encoding system.
In this manner the network can test the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is to be guaranteed also possible that the acted Bitcoins in the calculation book common in the entire network of the public accounts are available.
The decisive step exists therein to register this new transaction into this book.
This happens over a mathematical task, that is started on the computers whereby the winners, who is a type preliminary headquarters banker who possesses privilege, to add this additional line.
It concerns a cutting up of the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and join it a number thereto before the entire becomes "chops".
It is the goal of finding that number, that yields a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number was found, the other knots effortlessly can test whether it is the correct.
The transaction is connected therefore durably with the chain of all other transaction, and each modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay two times for deceiving very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one would be validated both transactions by the network and remains the other without connection because both different fingerprints possess.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To the prevention of an inflation, this reward regularly is halved, probably before end 2012.
The Bitcoins present in the circulation are limited therefore to 21 million, but lets up to a hundred millionth divisible, what one certain latitude...
In addition the difficulty of the task with every improvement of the computing power is increased.
Life of the network had already heights and depths.
The web pages that allocate services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin enclosures stolen.
"The used weakness concerns not the actual protocol", assures Pierre Noizat, that just Paymium introduced, that is a business for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The EZB reports also over the possibilities of the money wash with the help of this anonymous service.
To be sure cash shows also these deficiencies.
Important participants such as Wikipedia deny contributions of this type.
Of other like the blog platform Word press, they are accepted.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann institute in Israel analyzed and shown the calculation book that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in the circulation.
In November a "Mega sale" was started.
"Thirty thousand dollar were exchanged", is happy Jon Holmquist that works for the business Coinabul, that converts Bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, that also author of a book is over this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses however Bitcoin to the validation of the transaction that are through it cheaper.
In addition the proprietor administers its identity and can remain therefore anonymous.
The system easily can implement become at the dealers, and no new terminals or computer programs latter must install.
They must indicate simply only an address, "photographs and recognized" will can that of a telephone, gives Pierre Noizat on, that assures, that it user cable would send has.
A general trend is to be indicated it, with which hierarchical systems are roofed for the benefit of more strongly horizontally directed systems.
"It becomes some time last, until itself Bitcoin puts through, but 2013 could a turning point be", predicts it.
The EZB plans in its report by the way, the different to value today as a highly esteemed risks in the case a success of this currency newly.

We are drawn-off from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops left its responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the USA would be allowed to follow end 2014.
It is at the time that the Afghan army seizes the possession of its territory again, and that the Afghan population decides its future without expecting all of us.
We punished especially the Afghan farmers in that we looked at it as a terrorist.
And us even with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and verse honors.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders, who fled to Pakistan, but frequently also out of farmers, who deny an armed foreign presence, like at present the Soviets.
They want to defend its century old and archaic traditions, also if Dschihadisten, Pakistani, Arabian, Usbeken and Tadschiken joined to them.
Tolerates, supports sometimes of the local rebellious, will be latter no longer there if the western countries more discretely become.
The deduction of the French troops of the base in Nijrab, that I observed of a hill planted with almond trees that was financed with the help of French credit, resulted regular.
The truck flown over by helicopters reaches and reached tank convoys Kabul without being attacked.
From end 2014, there will be no more influx of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance of 1994 to 1996, the conditions changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country based on the battles of the different rebellious groups of the war covered.
Your takeover was looked at at that time as a kind of release and return to the security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the Obskurantismus of the farmer overwhelmed by the organization al Qaida, but its situation did not improve itself until today.
Former Mujaheddins, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the joint wish to hold the women in a subordinated position.
The most important personalities of the antisowjetischen of war came 2001 again at the power.
They changed in profit-seeker in that they seized plots of land of the government in order to sell it as a building country at fugitive out of the Iran and Pakistan and so utility out of the massive American award of lower orders stretched.
They brought themselves in discredit, and that of them were not involved even in the fights.
How I heard it in the campaigns, the people wish for a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, so like that, that the American grants were able to utilize make itself to: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people have the war and its ideologies satisfied.
During its exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact to the modern world, and its advantages wetted.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants what one-fifth of the entire population is.
In the cities, the national schools are full of girl such as boy.
One will have to make available this young person, who want to return neither to the Obskurantismus of the former parties yet to the corruption of certain managements, jobs.
Everyone, also the armed parties, are possessed is regarded of mobile phones; television with its Turkish series that represent a modern world, everywhere.
An army is now available.
Will the authorities stand becomes, under its command force it when legitimate looked at?
Former commanders of the antisowjetischen battle strive already for the restoration of the militia in the province, that will evade the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, that country of the mountains with strong local identities would have of one certain decentralization by the example of the western nations profit should, but through abolition of the office of the Prime Minister, that existed since the constitution of 1964, the USA wanted to make a centralized country with a strong presidential force out of it.
President Karzaï wants no foreign inspections, especially on the occasion of the choices planned for April 2014.
To be sure its country is since the '50's and already long before dependent on foreign aid.
Industries were not constructed again, operable obstruction works are not were not repaired available and important irrigation system.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetable, is nothing produced.
The precedence is let the private initiative.
In a country, that was arranged by 30 years war bottom, a national inspection of the infrastructures would have been required.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan would possess mineral resources immense.
This reinforces yet the impression that the western countries were only on the spot in order to seize itself its.
Without processing energy, around the iron ore or copper ore on the spot, and/or without means of transportation for an export over the mountains no mining is possible.
The Chinese already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let make and remain the international archeologists (financed of the world Bank) on the gigantic Buddhist site its excavations the most important employers of the province.
One day it will be also required that Afghanistan and Pakistan, of which extensive the importations and exports are dependent, produce, again normal relations.
The deduction of the French battle troops was locked on the 20th of November.
The new cooperation contract plans the continuation of traditional aids: Girl secondary schools and boy secondary schools, institute for French at the universities, French institutes, collaboration in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area, support of the archeological delegation.
Since 2009 a service of "civilly military actions" of the ministry adjusted became for defense (Cimic), the 2012, carried out numerous public-spirited works and measures in dozens of mountain villages for the rehabilitation of the agriculture and carry out let by a small French non-government organization in order to try, to win" the "hearts and spirits and to reach the impossible task of the compatibility of aids and offensive actions.
These works, for which numerous local labor forces were required, were able to contribute in addition to suppress the uprising: Irrigation, well, drinking water, again reforestation, fruit trees, ground protection and increase of the agricultural usable spaces.
Which souvenir do we put back Euro after military editions of two billion?
A much budget more modest will contribute to the improvement of the local conditions of life, that are very hard in these valleys lying often in a height by more than 2000 meters.
In the message, dozens of inquiries written of small agricultural intention of communities of the province Kapisa went in.
So that the farmers of the uprising led by foreign groups free themselves, what after its own statements its wish is, would be the continuation more slightly, well more controlled and it directly relevant civil aids to its favor required.

A constitution with the breach pole in Egypt
It concerns a new poker game of Präsident Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains ever split more with regard to the constitution explanation, that grants it temporarily the unlimited authority, then, it concluded to set all on a card.
To the surprise all it announced on Wednesday that the verfassungsgebende meeting would dismiss its final frame at the next day.
Before just a week, the country chief had granted this plenum two additional months for the conclusion of its works.
Egypt has relied now for almost two years on a preliminary, repeatedly altered text, what weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal disorder.
This new initiative provided only for an even stronger split of the country.
For its opponents, the president in its persists "autocratic delirium" in that he breaks" further "its word and "the right with feet steps".
On sides of its advocates, one assures that it is a way to conclude the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
Within 14 days, a referendum should be held off.
A very short period that forces the brothers in addition to forgo its intention, to declare the text section to be section to the egyptians.
For the president, it is also a type and manner to regain its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages in the entire country.
After affirmation in an interview with the American newsreels Times, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the egyptians will agree benevolent.
Especially since the Egyptian people with this fall back rushed on one voting an ultimatum placed becomes: "Either agrees its for my design or I retain the unlimited authority", latter should come to after acceptance of the constitution supposedly an end.
85 chiefly Islamist members of this verfassungsgebenden meeting dismissed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals is not come later the request.
Shortly before the constitution explanation in the middle of November they turned away itself because they are of the opinion, that they were not in a position to bring its visibility manner to bear.
Representative of human right organizations, religious minorities or the civil company likewise acted.
To the accomplishment of the decision capacity, mornings in all became would hurry yesterday 11 people, deputy members, added.
Some stand the moslem brothers very near.
It is not surprisingly that the articles unanimously were dismissed usually.
The commentators found it by the way entertaining that the single difference of opinion of the day came... in the time for the prayer to the expression, because some members of the group of the opinion were, that the pendulum clock of the verfassungsgebenden meeting did not go exactly.
The texts that yet was dismissed yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Articles 2 that stretched all attention on remains in the end identically with that of the constitution of 1971 and purports that "the principles of the shariah are" the main source the to the right.
To replace the salafistischen parties, for which the erection of the Islamic is to the right an important demand, had the hope, "the principles" by "the rules", what possible would have made a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact is that this article was not changed, a proof of its good will and for its respect vis-à-vis the other members of the Egyptian company.
"Sanctimony" reciprocate the liberals that look at this only as a propaganda blow.
According to for them the Islamisierung of the constitution takes place via other articles.
At the same time they have especially articles 220 in mind, that the university al Azhar awards an advising function, especially with regard to the examination of the conformity with the laws of the shariah.
Loud the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier this is disturbing because "the people who are requested to an attitude were not selected, and possess no democratic legitimacy.
One can see herein the first signs of a Theokratie".
The fears of the liberals are nourished moreover of the fact that the next chancellor of this university might be moderated by far less as the present.
"Presently no concrete religious engagement is to be recognized.
With this constitution, we remain in the frame of the middle class country.
Most lawyers who worked at this text are no Ulema, but rather academician, that in part in the French system instructed become are", soothes Alexis Blouet, that a doctoral dissertation writes over the Egyptian constitution transit ions.
It clears however, "that with regard to the articles 220 an ambiguity exist can, because the related concepts are borrowed the religious vocabulary.
One has reference here especially to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisdiction, Anm d. speech.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide about that".
Next to its religious aspect, the text dismissed yesterday is criticized strongly based on the long-range authorities, that it grants the president of the republic.
The moslem brothers argue that these are compared reduced to the former regime clearly.
A further issue: the authorities of the army.
In the harmony with the wish of the military, the test of the defense household is not produced the parliament, but rather a national defense advice.
Just as there will be no ban of civil action in courts martial how it demanded the unions to the defense of the human rights.
Latter its fears announce also with regard to the text, that they look at as a freiheitsbedrohend.
The state of affairs of the blasphemy is maintained, and offenses are forbidden now, what could be right serious consequences for the on freedom of speech, especially for the press.
In addition no more article has reference to the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef of Watch humane Rights.
According to your opinion the single positive point is the ban of the torture through articles 36.
This word was not contained in the prior constitution.
While the Egyptian president yesterday evening must itself on television external, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The advocates of the country chief will march past Saturday.

"The large and powerful" leads until Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While delegate and Bürgerrechtler discuss about that, which utility brings the law over binding jumping it for migrants, criminal act already with falsified certificates
Annually 13 million foreign workers to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia come.
That of them are the citizens of the headquarters Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
It is the your single goal to earn money for the support of the families remaining in the homeland.
On the 1st of December, a law stepped effective, that according to every work migrant a test, that certifies knowledge of the Russian language, discard must.
Previously this regulation applies only to migrants, whom in the service sector, in which municipal dwelling economy want to work and in the retail trade.
However the tests should become gradually according to federal migration authority future for all foreign workers the duty.
At the same time one must discard not only jumping it, but rather also tests into the Russian story and the bases of the legislation.
Must knowledge of language both proved become for the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizen of countries, in whom Russian is office language.
Also of this law excluded are people who have receive its education testimonies and diploma before the ruin the Ussr in 1991.
Sense, problematic nature and protection of the rights
The entirety of the test places becomes language under the Ägide of the Puschkin institute for the Russian, that Russian university of the friendship among nations, that moscovite of nationals university, that saint Peter castle of nationals stand university and other Russian universities.
The migrants can discard the tests in all cities; already now already more were opened in Russia than 160 corresponding centers.
The initiative to the introduction of the tests was supported of the delegates of the Staatsduma and the federal migration authority.
Bürgerrechtler on the other hand asked question following in the press repeatedly before the taking effect of the law: What does that bring very actually?
Which variations does the direction bring to have to show knowledge of language, both for the Russians and for the foreign workers?
Above all, reply speaker of the migration authority, would go it therefore to diminish the number of the slave laborers.
"Many speak now over the protection of the rights of work migrants", says the leader of the representation of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Your rights must be protected however already against its departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
On problems, migrants knock without occupation, development, knowledge of language and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant will meet without knowledge of language inevitably people with evil intentions, who stick it under the pretext of aid into some dark, narrow barracks, where he from will await with dozens his equal months without meal and documents and 12 to 14 hours will work at the day.
Many troubles of our migrants reach us.
"In the homeland becomes you the one promised, and in the arrival become you deceived, get its passports decreased and receive not the promised wage", confirms the leader of the central administration for work migration of the tadschikischen migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Do not scold, boss!
Nevertheless many citizens of the centrally Asian republics, who want to earn its money in Russia, admit, that they do not control not only the language of the goal country, but rather can express itself also in its own language hardly in writing.
That is natural not so very its guilt when rather the evil: Only A FEW Turkmenen, Usbeken and Tadschiken can afford also only a sensible reason education.
For in its families, it does not give yet once money in order to nourish the children, let alone, them respectable clothing to buy shoes and school things.
As a teenager, these children seize then at once the first opportunity to the Geldverdienen.
"It is difficult without knowledge of language", admit it.
"You feel lowers you and inferiorly".
Bürgerrechtler emphasize following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status must discard the test.
Do not have this status, gives it no test and consequently no official work.
In the meantime the large part of the foreign workers stays further illegally in Russia.
"Sincerely welcome" or "access for unauthorized forbidden"
Many migrants confirm that it is not simple to receive in Russia an official status.
Bureaucratic hurdles are the reason and natural the linguistic difficulties.
Moreover costs the legalizations moneys: 12 to 16 thousands rouble.
One can make a falsified registration quickly and solely for one and a half thousands.
The colleagues of the Russian police know that our documents are falsified chiefly and we are not registered, and from that cases of extortion emerge then.
"You want on or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea", expresses itself the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow vis-à-vis journalists.
Shun" "merely no costs for incorrect papers
Already at the day, at which the law stepped effective turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be falsified.
Some falsified certificates, that certify the completion of the jumping it, became fitting taken already of colleagues of the federal migration authority.
The falsified papers were printed with an usual color printer.
Naturally the new owners received this not for nothing: To be able to save every migrant who hoped, itself so the tests, paid documents seven thousand for that rouble.
That is more than twice as much like the costs for the official test: This costs a work migrant three thousand roubles.
About the fact that the most important direct task exists therein of protecting the system against corruption so that the certifications cannot be bought simply, are itself both office carrier and Bürgerrechtler united.
For the moment, the authorities only can promise foreign workers, who fall in the first time through the test, that they receive time for a language mean course.
In addition newcomers are offered without knowledge of language places in areas, in which no active understanding with people is necessary.

Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal weapon market
Share of legal weapons at criminal offenses extremely slightly
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans an intensification of the weapon law for private possession of firearms.
Therewith the authorities react to the youngest events: Injured in shootings on weddings as well as seven dead in the crazed rampage of the moscovite lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police does not want to forbid the carrying of deadly weapons in the public and here wants to mount the age for the possession of firearm of 18 on 21 years.
The chairperson of the Duma committee on security and corruption fight, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised the suggestion that the changes are produced at the weapon law briefly the Duma.
Everyone is not therewith satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems through "attraction of the screws".
On the Internet an open letter was published, whose authors - representative of different weapon associations - demand by the authorities, to take by "senseless intensification" distance.
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very slight, expressed the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, to the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes with application of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012 were committed while for the same period altogether 1,168 thousands offense were indicated.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that an intensification of the law will hold off for private possession of firearms criminal not therefrom to make use of on the black market.
Currently one can find according to the authors in Moscow each possible weapon for little money.
In the meantime the Ministry of the Interior emphasizes that the distribution of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons arrive over several canals on the black market.
There are five such head canals, tells a colonel Viktor Baranez former that ten years in the development ministry and in the general staff was active.
Screenshot of a web page that supposes weapon orders
The first canal is the army and/or the military, i.e. weapons, that were stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons became both of the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern itself stolen", says Baranez.
On the second canal, illegal weapons that are stolen custodians of the law by criminal come.
Baranez clarifies that to this weapons count, that were stolen both out of the armories of the police and direct by colleagues of the punishment pursuit authorities.
Further illegally sold weapons come from military weapon warehouses.
In many military warehouses, it came frequently to explosions.
"It gives proofs, that it itself in some cases around arson was, around the lack about weapons to gloss over", says the former military member.
A contribution to the black market also the weapon manufacturers perform in accordance with Baranez.
"Nowadays gives it innumerable private armament factories, that the international competition do not withstand and therefore the weapons under the hand on the black market, about in Moscow, dissipate", reports the expert.
A further canal of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many pistols and weapons come out of poor countries such as Kirgisien.
"There gives it an own production skilled-labor sometimes as well as a mafia, that the smuggling organizes", clarifies the former military member.
From where do the weapons come?
Experts calculated, which share everyone approximately has the five canals at the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was composed of the center for problem analyses and national administration.
Report of analyzed the experts the Ministry of the Interior and the federal service for national statistics, kriminologische literature and publicly accessible data on portal to the subject of weapons.
The predominant part of the illegal weapons comes according to the investigators of the army and the legal insurance authorities.
The half of all weapons on the black market would be there through that "guilt of responsible, that in its work with weapons to do have arrived", is named it in the report.
The data of the researchers according to come go coming 17% of the weapons from conflict zone, 14% on thefts in the weapon production back, and 5% out of illegal excavations.
A sale adviser of a weapon store who does not want to be named nominally assures that weapons that are found in illegal excavations, already long no one buys more, because they become obsolete.
According to it it is more frequent that dealers obtain the supply in a weapon warehouse.
Over a Fähnrich, a weapon, for example a pistol of the type TT becomes, bought.
The weapon is issued and is delivered by the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon into the city and sells it there for 900 Euro per piece with two magazines", tells he
"The police knows naturally over all and leads therefore, if it the plan to the disclosure of crime do not keep can, periodically control purchases with dealers through, the illegal weapon offer", joins the sale adviser thereto.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyer and salesman find most frequently over acquaintance together.
I had looked at web pages and blogs when someone became on me attentively and me proposed to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait on me, that me at one certain place would bring where we could negotiate then the price.
I learned the price for the weapon first there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"Around a weapon to provide, require I an acquaintance, the contacts has", tells the sale adviser. "I have such an acquaintance, but I do not trust" to it.
There is dealer on the markets, but there one must go and make arrangements with a code like "of Iwan Iwanowitsch, that lets align, that the daughter has" lost a tooth.
I come presently even at some blow rings over an acquaintance, to whom I trust.
It delivers the blow rings also only therefore because it knows, to me that I it not verpfeife.
Novices search for weapons on different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried itself middle of the 1990 as a buyer of illegal weapons when he wrote an article to this subject.
The schemes did not change according to it.
It got a photo album in which "all possible" was portrayed.
"I felt me like in the luxury store", remembers the military member.
The buyer does not get the cat in the sack according to Baranez, but rather everything can try.
I as a potential customer would not buy up would go place simply only, but rather with the salesman into the forest, and there we a target.
"I then there can shoot, and if I therefrom convinces am, that the weapon a good shot has, negotiate we together", describes the expert the action.
Shopping of the sofa from
Internet search engine show search results to web pages and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
Necessarily yet will give neither any papers it personal meeting.
"You require only the suitable sum money", is named buy" it in the advertise notice on the web page "battle pistol or weapon.
There users give your orders for and place inquiries.
Becomes also at minor sold?
"Naturally without license", asks user "Iwan" (literal quotation).
"A TT buys. Moscow", reads the laconic inquiry of "Fedorenkow".
The federal security service turned go recently innumerable certificate web pages, and buyer who want to acquire weapons, the service in large numbers into the network.
The people come like hungry fishes in the feeding and land in Siberia then and may shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I heard of following scheme: The web page is registered normally abroad, and Russian laws find no application.
The responsibles suppose the orders.
The buyer transfers the money over a bank vending machine.
"As an answer receives it a photo and a description of the ambush of the weapon", reports the press officer of the public-spirited organization "Pravo well oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that one also empty can go out to the end and can come behind lattices if one places an inquiry on a web page.
The federal security service turned go recently innumerable certificate web pages, and buyer who want to acquire weapons, the service in large numbers into the network.
"The people come like hungry fishes in the feeding and land then in the Siberian work warehouse and may coal shovel", says he.
A Makarow for 100 U.S. dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearm is to be reckoned according to expert with praising of 100 to 900 U.S. dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo well oryzhie" one can buy a pistol of the type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
One must wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapon warehouses of overseers of middle rank.
The official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior according to the number of the offenses with illegal weapons was due throughout Russia in the period from January to October 2011 around 7% to 22.9 thousands while the number of the uncovered cases of theft and extortion in the context with weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and explosive devices shrank around 7.8%.

In the USA, almost Food and supermarket employed strike
Every fourth US American youth sits sometime behind the cash register of Mc Donald's it
In the past days, it came everywhere it in the USA to massive protests against low wages in branch of Walmart and restaurants of popular almost-Food-chains such as Mc Donald's, castle King, Taco Bell, Wendy's it and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will swell yet further or whether them already soon again the air goes out.
The protests are supported of labor unions and several to the left arranged public-spirited organizations.
Next to the increase of the modest wages of simple Walmart- and almost-Food-employed, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing labor unions.
Previously this industry of the economy is organized hardly unionist.
46 cents per year?
The protests began looked past week after Thanksgiving, at the so-called Friday, at which in the USA clearance sales took place, that lured millions of customers, what led sometimes to melee.
This day some Walmart colleagues of whom it gives worldwide 2.2 million laid down, its work and bestreikten together with labor unions and left activists branch of the chain whose target group are people of low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, of diaper over hunt weapons and car batteries up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The good in the Walmart branches is on average between 8 and 27% more favorable than in large supermarkets.
Therefore many of the negligibly paid Walmart employed shop only at the own job.
The prices and the its assortment made Walmart to one of the largest businesses in the USA.
According to critics Walmart so favorably can sell the good often only therefore because the colleagues badly are paid.
Latter complain also about heavy work conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanner.
Friday" "looked demanded the participants of the protests at that raises and expressed its annoyance about the fact that the contribution had climbed for the betriebseigene health insurance of 30 on 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart colleague, who earns 9.5 U.S. dollars of the hour, could not afford this increase, said it.
Researchers out of the Californian university in Berkeley cover that, if the business raises the average wage to 12 dollars the hour, it Walmart 3.2 billions of dollar cost would become.
Those are ca. Contribute 1.1% more than it now for wage.
If Walmart would transfer to the raises completely the customers, every purchase cost it in the future only 46 cents more.
Per year, additional expenditures of only 12.39 dollars would be that for it in comparison with today.
Advocates of Walmart assess satisfied that it came only in nine states to protests and this the business no losses at all of given.
That looked lasted Friday into its store of 8 o'clock evenings on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period, Walmart sold approximately 5000 articles per second.
Altogether the Walmart cash registers carried out "looked at that Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The speaker of the business, served Fogelman, maintained in an interview on the web page of the to the left arranged Huffington postal service that altogether "less than five" Walmart colleagues laid down the work and the protest action had been solely "a further PR trick" of the labor union that organized the protests.
"Free cash register"!
The protests went on this week in New York where its goal were not however Walmart branch (that in this progressive city not desired and therefore are previously non-existent), but rather McDonald's it and other bargain restaurants.
McDonald's it says, the business would sell billions of portion, and nevertheless one grants you no sick days, and you are not paid for your honest works!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York city advice
Presently the minimum wage is in accordance with more federally and New York legislation about 7.25 dollars the hour.
In almost-Food-restaurants, the minimum wage is not raised got gradually, to be sure too strongly, and in the average its simple colleague in New York 8.90 U.S. dollar of the hour.
No one earns less than it in this expensive city.
How it is possible to come out in New York with so little money, is me inconceivable.
There was once a time, in which almost one-quarter of all US American youths stood after the school in McDonald's it behind the counter, to be sure the youths lived yet at its parents.
Hardly one saw therein the head source of income or planned to remain more long there.
Now meet me in interviews with colleagues of McDonald's it permanently people who lament himself, that they must come out with this wage and must nourish sometimes even its children.
On the other hand there is notices in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal a commentary, whose author in to get it would be irresponsible, children if one would not know, how one should nourish it.
The participants of the protests, who began on Thursday it around 6.30 clock mornings before the McDonald's in the 40th streets and in the Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of almost-Food-restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 U.S. dollars of the hour, what corresponds than a doubling of the present minimum wage to more.
They demanded further the development of labor unions in the almost-Food-industry.
The US American law forbids it the business management to stand this goal in the way and to admonish or to release labor union members.
On the other hand the business management does not make it them simply.
The foundation of labor unions in the almost-Food-industry is difficult however also for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel turnover.
Discontented
There were loud protests this day also before many other almost-Food-restaurants in Manhattan.
The highpoint of the protests was a meeting at the noon before the McDonald's it at the Times Square, with which some local democrats spoke, under that city councilor Jumaane Williams that said: "McDonald's it says, it would sell billions of portion, and nevertheless one grants you no sick days, and you are not paid" for your honest works!
The demonstrators were supported also of other prominent New York democrat, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio that said, that "we the almost-Food-colleagues should support jointly so that they can receive a just wage and can reach the economic prosperity, that of every New York earns"!.
According to New York, Times was this the largest action of its type in the story of the US American almost-Food-industry.
However only several hundred were people on the spot, of which by far all in the almost-Food-industry are not busied, in which in New York ten thousands work.
Yet is not to be seen whether the radios of these protests measures entire will mobilize.

"The brain lets previously only moderate overburden" itself
The technologies modern with followers popular subject of the expanded reality is perceived recently for usually by the lens of some special glasses.
First Google in the summer presented became a functioning model in its annual conference, in November then well known that also Microsoft had registered a corresponding patent.
In the conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, become to be sure clear that the glasses was for the scientists of the business only a run station.
It excites the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Describing you please shortly, which researches your group operates.
- We busy us with the interaction of person and machine, want to expand at the same time however the boundaries of this interaction.
Previously humanity is stick remained chiefly in the phase, in which with pixel on flat screens worked becomes, that are touched sometimes also.
We however 5-10 years want to look ahead and want to anticipate the radical variations of this interaction.
For example the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are is sold a progress, and nowadays no more Xbox without Kinect because all are interested in movement control.
- What expects us yet in the future?
- Although Kinect brought the interaction on a physical plain, much plays itself yet on the flat screen off, sometimes in 3D.
The petition of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the edition previously not yet decisively.
We try to change that, work at real three-dimensional representation systems on the basis of different technologies, under that projection.
We must release the world of computers into our physical world and more tangibly must make it.
In addition it is however required that not only the user is recognized, but rather also its environment.
Then we could supplement the real world much more simply through virtual objects.
And first of all we should become these bescheuerten Virtual-Reality-helmets loose!
- What do you think over language control?
Is you chosen, but it not is overvalued?
- You are not certain the all-purpose solution because it raises questions to the privacy, because one would not like to inform always all next about its actions and intentions.
Each type of interaction with computers is actual good, to be sure each in its certain niche.
For example we worked in the area of the control of objects on public places at a project, with which we experimented with short and tight, instead of with unloading gestures.
At the same time the gestures were not recorded of the object camera, but rather of a bracelet, that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
Yet it is relatively large, could reduce become theoretically however on the size of a watch.
But altogether the future belongs to be sure, for example gestures and language to mixed control types.
- Like that?
Would - we you ask me for example to pass this soda can to you?
They say it and point simultaneously on that.
- Normally I say it simply only.
- Oh, that could be recognized very heavily.
Does - that not be named want, you that the user adapts himself to that, what can perform a machine to the respective moment, and what?
- Unconditionally, but it does not concern here a mutual approach.
I think that we work will must in the near future above all at the development of new sensor types, that enable it to grasp reactions of people more exactly.
For example laser sensors can be that because they offer in the depth a good solution, what is very important.
- Which claims place you coming from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors at modern cameras?
Does it lack at solution, depth or something else other?
- The present generation is in the reason a good starting point for our work in the area of the three-dimensional recognition.
Natural 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
Yet the essential matter the megapixels themselves are not, but rather the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So seen are all present technologies for us not good enough because the developers the algorithms have more work.
Not only the solution must be considered along the X and the Y-, but rather also along the Z axis.
Also the speed and the amount of the pictures per second are important.
The movements of the person are said extremely dynamically and openly, are the present 30 fps especially for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor with a controllable processing delay between 1 to 100 millisecond in our laboratory in speech moon whereby the current commercial sensors lie (60 to 100) more closely at the second value.
Do not understand everyone how very that influences the interaction of person and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly so a device, only without contact control and with more pictures per second.
Would - the amount of the cameras not have to be increased?
- Kinect works presently with three "cameras" whereby one of them is actual an infrared transmitter and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actual an usual RGB camera.
It does not serve to the calculation of the object depth.
More cameras could solve possibly the problem...
Reinforce or the problem because more calculations would be necessary.
A flexible, Kinect similar system, with which we could play with different camera inclinations, would be beautiful in order to assess how that helps us in the three-dimensional ascertainment of a position.
- If I quite would remember, Microsoft did not present in contrast its glasses to Google the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the expanded reality in the everyday life the glasses the best outlooks has?
- Natural it is not comfortable to hold underway always a Smartphone in the raised hand, but I think following: The craziest variant would be a "changing" expanded reality, with which we could shift over a Cloud of the glasses on the Smartphone
The glasses are a personal Gadget and therein its strength (private can only you see) lies prevents, but simultaneously also its weakness, for an expanded reality by means of glasses that you can work jointly with other at virtual objects.
- Places we us a moment long before that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only Tony strongly out of Iron one, but rather also Normalsterblichen.
There is a problem, on which critics of this idea frequently refer: There is no perceptible reaction!
The hands sense generally nothing!
Which answers does your group want to give on this objection?
- In my lectures I speak often therefrom that the expanded reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between person and machine.
I think, the eighth breakthrough could become thoroughly the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is presently the use of the second hand as something projection document unusual.
It takes pressure excellently aware!
There are however also technologies that are aligned actually on that to lend the "pictures in the air" something strong, for example produced the Interferenz of some arranged ultrasound rays in a certain point where the finger is, a feeling, that is momentarily however yet so weak, as someone blew over the hand bales.
There are also volumes for the wrist, that influence on the nerve ending in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
Did - you try, overburden the brain to?
Think let that it senses that, what should sense it, if it sees just something?
- That is a good idea, tried we it not yet.
Here a further task, with which we to fight still have become long, hides, namely a person, who is physically in a closed room, let believe, he would be instead in an open, practically endless room; here we work at drafts with treadmills (other than in fitness studio), mobile platforms as well as large balls.
Previously the brain only moderate can be overburdened, and before us, yet many work rich years lie.
Just that makes the work in the field of the virtual reality for a researcher so dressing: In many subjects, we stand first at the beginning.

Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt. ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Peter castle vanguard", that is dedicated to city inhabitants, who form the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the selected list, already high-ranking representatives of the Peter castle landed go taking place via art scene, whose the boundaries of the city out and find that often recognition in Europe without being well known in the remainder of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The entire city knows Kirill Miller that in red of clothed bearded, that one finds once museum in the Russian, once in the summer garden, once in scene meeting or on openings.
Wherever the pictures by Kirill Miller also issued become, attract it large crowds of people on.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Peter castle socially philosophical artist whom new myths create.
Kirill Miller is an illuminating personality of the Peter castle vanguard end of the 80 and/or beginning of the 90.
It is also a man of the city and does magic through its presence on the street its citizen a smile into the face and provides with them for good mood.
Recently he snatched himself a trick organ and became the Peter castle trick organ player, there he himself for this difficult roll with regard to its artist existence, its philosophy and be felt image finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you not actually always in red and for example in yellow or turquois in the city underway?
I selected the color red as a fashion designer, who explains himself with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image adviser and company.
In the company, all evokes, what deviates something from the gray standard, aggressions and bad behavior.
I want to come however through my provocation with the people into the conversation.
Each of my past provocation was an invitation to the conversation.
- When do you know that you must become painter?
- In a display in the culture palace Newskij, with which my works were issued.
I concept that I must go this way.
Then the time of the old free went, however painters not officially acknowledged were over at that time, and new and free painters how I incomprehensible.
I friendly with the painters of the new generation, therefore with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from that emerged was me "Puschkinskaja 10", and then first once end.
It pulls me to the theater, to the fashion, to the music, actually to all, except the literature.
- And all that united itself in your Art-Klinik.. - It was important to me to stand in the midpoint of the Peter castle culture where the best creating artists should meet themselves.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there there was a musically artistic club for the bohemian, the house of the Peter castle to the renovation works bohemian.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember me also how cord with its project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Cord and its friends sang simple songs to the Play cheek, carried narrow tricots and to them belonged also the composer announced today Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, became out of its "Leningrad".
Dress mountain moderated many programs the time ago of "Halli Galli".
We gave them dress mountain, and it began its large career, but it learned the bases here.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club" Griboedov" have its origin in the kind of clinic.
There our colleagues and regular guests went.
I am a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was in the press a survey with which it concerned the honor "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "artist of the year", and therewith I had arrived at the highpoint.
It is not easy to work in new times after old rules; I am a person of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In the current time, it is simple, famous to become, but culture and popularity are not the same: One can be famous without performing therewith a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Real pearls are many of my pictures and express clearly the relevance and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have a display with the subject "the Russian museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I was earlier social, but now it hurts and prepares anxiety, to be.
In a clown, that of all smudges and loses its tragedy.
I love have the grotesque, and I grotesque ideas.
Let's rescue for example the world in that we prescribe, that every has to disguise itself completely.
Now every pays attention to the clothing and orients itself towards the Äußeren and not at the interior of the person.
But perhaps one may not give a person the hand, but rather should spit it into the face.
The deceit disappears through the disguising.
- Recently we saw you in the roll of the municipal trick organ player. - A culture city should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
Can - also commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, respectful and flattering.
We see the ruin of the cultures.
Earlier the people formed large groups: The Bohemiens loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there is Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to pleased all.
I am no one hundred-dollar-note that pleases everyone.
Now you must consider, whom you will please.
Now every cult star has approximately 100 followers.
- To the entrances of Stas Michailow several thousands come however!
- To it left women come plays, there the sexually social sphere a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and 10 thousands do not come, consequently there is less management, money, and everything goes to ruin.
I have follower, and the most important is not, to deceive it and is to be destroyed the reached not.
In my youth, I painted such pictures, that hung at a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I began with pictures, that come normally first at the end of the career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It is named: intellectual culture and consumption culture.
Consumption has generally no culture, that is somewhat entire other.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up rejected with artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty, and money in order to be able to paint.
That is the culture that I advocate.
- Kirill, what does Petersburg be missing?
- Goods culture experts.
One says: Servant of the culture.
Yet every of them cannot concern itself with culture.
At the real czars, it was differently, for the czars understood perhaps much of culture, but they understood that correct experts are not necessary.
In Moscow, there are presently good advisers.
In Petersburg, we have is blocked which that could be experts, but them the way because it more high-ranking experts needs, who correctly value the first and clear them the way.
Now only the own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, however with the difference that they honestly say, that they don't have to suppose all contemporary art and some painters must seek themselves therefore other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the culture capital; in Moscow, there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art only heavily can grow up.
We require a cultural breeding ground, for for example that have is we meanwhile more author than a reader, and yet not correct.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit displays or concerts.
Here much are that fewer.
Art must be again modern, so like to start of the previous century.
The project is financed out of subsidies of the city Saint Petersburg

Birth in the universe
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceship with earth inhabitants on board make itself on the search for a replacement planets.
Rescue in order to humanity, the important question stands how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
There are not many choices according to my opinion.
De facto there are only two real planets that we at least hypothetically could inhabit.
"Namely Mars and Venus", says the scientific colleague of the astronomical star mountain institute Wladimir Surdin.
While however the conditions are comparatively life friendly on Mars, a temperature of 500 degrees rules on the surface of the Venus.
Live would be only in large height or in the orbit of the Venus, therefore in that all, possible.
The question of the propagation in the all treated the researchers first of all with regard to the Flora.
Already a half century before that experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas cultivated in the orbit did not differ in the slightest by the earthly types.
It followed the breeding of insects, more exact of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into the universe in order to investigate how the weightlessness affects the development of embryo.
It develops an entirely normal chick.
Yet then the problem begins.
"The problem insists therein, that the chick stop find must; it must on its legs stand can and begin, itself to move", clarifies the laboratory leader of the institute for medically biological problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without firm underground, the chicks flipped over wildly.
Ten hours of late stumpften the instincts of the new-born completely off.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later died it then simply.
"Twice let we chick slip and placed that very then on, because it is simply impossible, there with them to work", holds Wladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in that all firmly.
The last brood cage with animals flew 16 years ago into the orbit.
In the spring 2013, the experiments are continued.
However only same sexual species will be on the organic satellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that became all sent already fertilized in that.
Fundamentally was nothing assessed at the same time special.
"That was straight with the organic satellites, but was renewed it only a single experiment, and the researches must be continued", notes Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got new generation.
The problematic nature of the propagation directly in the space one was able to solve not yet.
The task is difficult.
Animals, that are torn out of its natural habitat, cannot follow simply its propagation drive.
In contrast to animals, the person could that fundamentally.
The Homo sapiens is capable to abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
Out of ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
Yet women have flown already for 50 years in that all.
There was the largest risk in Tereschkowa.
The most valuable that possesses humanity is the organism feminine.
Our gull flew therefrom, and following question would have been able to answer no one on the earth: Does it overcome the world space flight?
Will it be able to bring a child after this flight to the world?
"In the end answered no one this question", says space flight veteran awake seaweed Watschnadse.
The first feminine cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, bore in June 1964, only a year after its world space flight, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in that all, Swetlana Sawizkaja, that was twice in the orbit and performed even works outside of the spacecraft, a son bore.
Nevertheless a risk remains.
We have only extremely few cosmonauts with whom after long flights of all well went and got it healthy new generation.
"The more, is the more dangerous it itself in flights into the orbit", concludes cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian federation.
And yet humanity must after new ways in the biotechnology, that radiation protection and the producing of artificial gravitation seek.
The Hydrolabor in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is an obligatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a suspense condition, the cosmonauts win routine for the work in the open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Also if adults perceive water as comfortable, it is a strange environment; but baby perceive water as a natural element.
It is, would discard as the small Ichtyander testimonies therefrom that life emerged from at the country the ocean.
There is a context between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and can become accustomed that, that it then more easily to water.
In principle that is logical because from the birth for first swimming just once 2 weeks pass.
"That is too little time, around something to forget", says baby floating teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a new-born child the weightlessness is therefore a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the condition of the weightlessness, the belly musculature and basin musculature disappears enormously quickly and therewith also the capacity decreases to press out here the child.
Well well, let's go around that through birth its leading remedies.
The birth could take place for example also in a special chamber in order to press out here the child.
"But what does then" happen?, reads the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand the child needs also artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth attraction, the organism cannot instruct the skeleton and the muscles.
A new-born child cannot be stuck in the orbit like an adult to the training into a load suit.
It that will be missing simply, is what kind of life of elementary importance.
"This experiment, that we jointly undertake, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, in addition will lead, that we a hindered, a perfectly maladjusted person to the world bring become", says the leader of the bio-ethics commission of the institute for medically biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow, ahead.
Previously the birth of children in the universe is bare theory.
Sometime it becomes however reality if the earth inhabitants in its spaceships break open to a distant planet, that becomes the home for its in the all born descendant.

NKÚ boss: Inspection of the black system fails through get into debt of the politics
The Czech Republic controls in the context with public orders good control instances and appropriate laws, falls however into its application back.
In the conversation for this says the vice president of the highest control office (Nejvyšší kontrolní NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it correctly must be used - and this is in my opinion here not the case", comments on Kala the current situation.
To a similar result, apparently also a joint inspection comes through Czech and German inspectors.
As a negative practice example, it leads the attitude of prime minister Petr to that so-called. "Blackly system" on.
Did recently the prime minister say that the ODS the entrepreneurs not would annoy with inspections - is the system therefore now forbidden or permits?
"A law must yet its validity have, and if somewhat legally forbidden is, can yet not simply the government chairperson come, and the control office, whose duty now once the inspection of the compliance of the law is, in its activity hinder", places Kala firmly.
On the session of the control committee of the delegate chamber, you spoke over a joint Czech German project, in whose frame the laws of both countries were compared regarding public orders together.
About what did it go there concretely?
Test with which we began about two years ago concerns at the same time a parallel.
Simplified said, goes it therefore that the European legislature determines, how public orders are to be handled. On that the single national legislations construct. And in the end there is yet the actual practical application.
We compared this everything together, and although the test is not locked yet, we were able to assess extremely interesting differences. Generally said, are is the laws here perhaps even something else "severe and more perfect", the actual application however in Germany in some parameters better.
Therewith is confirmed that it does not pass to set up again and again new and more exact rules. One must concern himself also with the actual application the to the right.
To what extent can the project be you an aid? What results for you from this project?
Just such a joint inspection could contribute in addition that we stop striving us permanently around a Perfektionierung of the laws and the decline and Austarierung of threshold values if this not especially positively has an effect evident.
Economics means to not to acquire a thing to a sensible price (what always the lowest price is) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or quite criminal actions.
But the decline of threshold values for orders does not guarantee that we reach this goal also.
Perhaps it is even so that we burden the system in this manner only with excessive "paperwork", and that that seek spaces in the system more simply have, it substantially to exploit the system as if the threshold values remained higher.
They speak over the problems in the practical conversion of the Czech award law.
How does the control system in Germany function?
Are there here a similar authority such as our NKÚ, or the system functions differently?
What the authorities concerns, similarly is constructed is the German counterpart to the NKÚ the federal board of audit, that like here and also over a council ordered, that is formed solely somewhat differently. Basically both authorities work however similarly.
Also the competences are to one certain mass comparably whereby Germany is however a state, i.e. that there are these boards of audit also in the single states - therein differs the German system of our.
The BRH may control only federal means, what corresponds to our national means.
Public means, that are administered here by the districts and communities, are subject there the inspection of the country boards of audit.
What concerns the German legislation, is that simpler than our?
Generally I would compare this without concrete statements only unwillingly. Nevertheless Germany in certain regard is designated often as an example whereby one not however certainly can say, that Germany in all is better.
Does that lie perhaps that there the inspectors are better?
That does not determine said, but how: I do not like such comparisons especially gladly.
To this yet is to be noticed in that also those countries that are for us an example have to fight also with problems.
Would otherwise they not have yes nothing of a collaboration with our authority, aware?
What concerns the Czech legislation, which meaning the amendment of the award law had for your authority, sense already any effects?
In consideration its that this novel is first short time effective, has an effect it in our tests until now not yet.
Because our inspections retroactively take place, one must here with one certain delay calculate.
We perceive obviously will have an effect effects sooner in the preparation phase of future inspections - so have we the new control instrument "recognition of risks of the uneconomical-ness" introduced and with this almost 14,000 public order tested and analyzed - here until now the changes because the threshold values change themselves, the conditions for certain types of announcement modified became among other things
Do you see the dismissal of this law sooner positively, or the system with further bureaucracy is burdened?
I think, determine is that this law a step into the correct direction and hope that this acceptance is confirmed.
It can appear however the problem that the rules become "more severe" and can be kept no longer.
Already under the prior rules, that of a test are subjected people vis-à-vis the carrier (for example, in the case a grandpa rational program of the regional politics, that regional advice) indicating account compulsory that each non-observance of the award law of an injury matches the household discipline.
Is it then however meaningful to make the law yet more severe?
In my opinion not in this manner.
The system must exclude those, must punish, that want to attack and abuse the system, and not those, that committed an irregularity, that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system pressures solely the bureaucracy even larger.
Where is the exit here?
Let's say first of all once, whom way is not goal leading.
The prime minister said recently that the ODS the entrepreneurs not with inspections the so-called. Would "blackly system" behelligen become - what is named that exactly?
Is the black system forbidden now or is permitted?
A law must have yet its validity, and if somewhat legally forbidden is, the government chairperson can come hinder yet not simply, and the control office, whose duty is now once the inspection of the compliance of the law, in its activity.
It can say: "We change the law and permit the thing", but it cannot say that we do so, as if would nothing be.
The award law contains relatively severe rules over the formal execution of certain processes - and that is also correct for the protection of the public competition.
On the other side, it is however also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded alone on the basis of irregularities.
The law never will be perfect, but correctly must be used it - and that is that what is missing here in my opinion.

Šimon Ornest: On our concerts, we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month the end of the world should take place?
That is one of those catastrophe messages, on which we start people so gladly.
With our volumes The Tap Tap, we make ourselves sooner about that amusingly and say that we are the single volume of the world, that can gather sufficient positive energy in order to delay or to prevent the end of the world.
In December you realize moreover a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you more closely introduce our readers the project?
It we concern plan a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung, that already two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for the 21st of December around 11:10 clock mornings.
At the day before that, i.e. on the 20th of December, simultaneously three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava take place from 21:00 clock.
The end of the concerts should be in about at present, to which on the Pacific island Kiribati, that lies in a time zone around 12 hours before us, the Maya calendar ends.
Of whom does this idea come?
Originally probably of me, we subsequently arranged the idea jointly with our graphics Honza Augusta.
At the same time we would like to gather not only sufficiently positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, but rather we would like to think also together with the public about that, in which condition deliver we this world once our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we developed also a unique collection of shoes, T Shirts, pockets and key followers against the end of the world, with whose purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people can support us also.
The volumes The Tap Tap also that has together with other interpreters moreover so-called. Hymn against the end of the world with the title "end of the world falls out of" received.
Already today the hymn is chosen on YouTube very. Will it sound also on the Benefizkonzerten?
Obviously, and to be sure entirely to the end, prefaced that everything out does not work and the end of the world takes place...
The hymn simultaneously is supposed to be sung by all interpreters on all three concerts.
Moreover the hymns live are transmitted together in a direct control of the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes of Tomá Hanák, that also the principle figure of the Jesus in the videoclip plays, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to the collaboration with both?
We cooperate realize also with further personalities of the Czech culture scene, what holds together therewith, that we many Benefizveranstaltungen and concerts...
We strive to bind these people intensively into our projects.
At the same time appeared that that are interested at a collaboration with us, and have joke on that.
Which purpose do the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world benefit?
For the arrangement of the barrier-free development center Studeo at which we work already six years together with the society Tap in that.
The students the are looked after regularly of lecturers, that help them in different leisure time activities.
Because the students do not control even the means, in order to search for the lecturers, we would like to help them in this manner.
In frame of the completion the an own building should emerge, in which we take in then with this project.
In every concert, several groups and interpreters appear.
After which criteria did you choose this?
We wanted to assemble a program, that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague appear for example China ski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with served Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Suchý.
You learn all further on the webpage www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large organizations" also for the future planned?
In May we appear for the first time at the citizen of Prague spring, and also for this concert, we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would like to appear also gladly in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we then already once in the USA are - this would connect also gladly with entrances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are appeared not exactly small, you already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow until now.
The Tap Tap is however a group that consists of people with handicap.
How do you master these trips logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it appears on the first view.
Five of our members are must be conveyed wheelchair driver, i.e. the wheelchairs in the baggage room. Moreover we must drag along naturally many instrument suitcases and other baggage...
Nevertheless it worked out previously always without problems, and British Airways were prepared always very well for us that I partially already was surprised sometimes.
Even in Moscow where we were recently, gave it no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison how it looks in the single countries with barrier freedom, like one there with hindered person goes around etc.
How did you experience these things previously?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and further cities, in which all better functions than here, we were straight in Russia of witness its that in the East of yet all in its beginning is.
Opposite Prague is not Moscow absolutely behindertengerecht. There it is still unusual if someone is in the wheelchair alone in the city center underway.
It is there not yet once obvious that one admits a wheelchair driver for example in the procession.
Fortunately societies that try emerge also there to refer to the problems of people with handicap.
And in which regard must we developed make up vis-à-vis that further countries?
There are hang yet many things, in which we afterwards...
In addition however yet is to be noticed in that an improvement of the situation also always depends on the exertion of the concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usually that also people with heavy handicaps move independently in the public room, into the museum go, use can etc. toilets.
It is however not exactly usual that there a larger group of hindered people is involved actively in the social events, therein are we with the volume The Tap Tap the west a few ahead!
Respect in the public and barrier freedom is a thing, but first if out of our rows important athletes, artist, actor, politician or lawyers come, really will begin the things to change.
Until now these are only individual cases of especially will strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is presently very popular. If we return however a couple of year: What did you motivate in 1998 in addition to establish a volume?
At that time I began as a caregiver in that where I met many young people, who were interested on that to be concerned with somewhat intensively.
And there I myself musician am and play among other things Saxofon, established I together with a colleague a music CORP.
Well, and gradually that is, like our moderator, to say maintains, run (laughs) something except inspection.
Did well known become err me the volumes however not until the last years, or I?
It agrees, helped has us that the collaboration with well known singers; moreover have we also begun to advertise actively for us.
Not deliberately became that, if one performs something and this is not to be seen outward, the own achievement in certain sense existed us.
Thanks to the EU promote moneys, we can furthermore good lecturers, high-value devices and and the like afford.
Was it your goal of bringing it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning I sensed the potential that one can concern the things differently.
In the Showbusiness copies today often one the other.
That is in its manner logical because all new is observed with caution and is accepted first after longer time.
There is only few things really unique, and I venture to maintain that Tap Tap belongs in addition.
The first impression that the spectator has usually is obvious empathy; that is only natural...
But this empathy is absolutely superfluously because people with handicap are no solitary and left beings, that we would have to regret.
People, who can live a full life and can develop, are as far as they have the means necessary in addition.
I say always that if people with handicap succeeds something, this not only for it itself a progress is, but rather for the entire company.
Was it for this success also helpfully that you are a severe boss, how one hears of many people?
If one would like to make somewhat well, one may go in in many things no compromises and must call for also a certain discipline.
This is in my opinion however totally normal.
Some come to us with romantic presentations, and if they assess then, that they have twice the week sample, preparation phases graduate must and spend much time on concert trips, goes out the enthusiasm in many quickly.
So it functions however everywhere, in every volume, that seriously wants to work and wants to reach something.
Presently The Tap Tap of twenty members has.
How many of them have been from the beginning, i.e. since 1998 there?
Only a more only: .
We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent that.
Who has the will and the desire at the joining in, is here always welcome.
Finds instead of at the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 21 o'clock

Poland and the space.
Past week was received Poland on a cabinet council session of the member nations of the European space organization ESA as a twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is therewith the second member nation out of the former Eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, that at the 12th of November 2008 ESA member became).
Poland began a narrow collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and tade part in the following years at several ESA projects.
The way of Poland in the space began to be sure much earlier.
Already before the second world war, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space flight busied itself whereby they bumped therewith not always into understanding.
I remind one here for example of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of the 6th of December 1933 in the Resident of Warsaw observatory with which the author introduced thought out of its pioneer work "entrance to the Kosmonautik".
The ideas of the young engineer (give. 1905) the listeners let themselves remembered however coldly, and after years Šternfeld yet that solely Dr. had shown Jan Gadomski interest in its work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP deer established by Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis deer in 1934 for "entrance to the Kosmonautik".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became later an important advocate of the astronomy and the space flight.
In Polish periodicals published it hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Contribution acknowledged Gadomskis worldwide to the development of the space flight was lauded among other things in that one of the crater was named on the earth turned away side of the moon after it.
Already in 1925, a railroad Draisine was constructed in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
The author of the design and the details this intention remained unfortunately unknown.
It is not clarified yet once whether the rocket should be used for starting or for braking the Draisine.
The information to this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to concern itself with rocket operated stories.
The institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi led the research projects.
Out of the traditional documents is evident that the research had advanced into the stage practical tests.
The research was interrupted then to be sure through the invasion of the German armed forces.
In 1937 immersed in the specialty press of that of Ing. Coming designs of a photo electric hunt rocket up, and in the year following on that appear the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
Both projects concerned themselves with the military utilization of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects were coordinated to the military utilization of the rocket technology of the temporary scientific consultation sow shot (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).
The from shot was arranged 1937, was concluded its work after two-year activity however by the beginning of the war.
Further articles to the space flight appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space flight company (pole skis Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company results 1954 in the November edition of the periodical Problemy in which four extensive articles of the space flight are dedicated.
The article of prof. M. Subotowicz contains the suggestion to the foundation of a space flight company.
At present there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the investigation of the space future would have.
Already in its beginning in 1956, the Polish space flight company PTA strove joins around one to the 1951 established international federation for space flight, and actual 1956 orderly member became the PTA already in the autumn.
In the following year, the first PTA chairperson, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), deputy chairperson of the international federation became for space flight.
It possessed this office to its death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA has been involved authoritatively in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for the scientific research.
The first type that completed became RM-1, in 1957 that first start resulted on the 10th of October 1958.
The rocket with a maximal altitude of 1800 ms was about 80 cm long and weighed not entirely 5 kg.
Later an improved version that RM-1A constructed,, and 1959 became began in the flight tests with the two step rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 ms long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development step should be already in a position to perform real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and should come for the observation of Höhenwinden to the use.
In 1962 however the further development was adjusted.
Successor of the first rockets of the type RM became developed that in the years 1962 to 1965 Meteor-1-Rakete.
The rocket was conceived as a two step rocket, its overall length amounted to was 510 cm and the start weight 32.5 kg.
Of this rocket, three types were developed distinguished (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), that from one another in the size of the carrier room for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete controlled frame fortune, Meteor-1B a carrier room with 0.4 liter over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximal altitude amounted to 37 km in all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2-Rakete was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 a start weight of 380 kg had and was in a position to convey a payload of 10 kg into a height of approximately 60 km.
After that the versions were constructed Meteor-2H and meteor-3.
Worth mentioning also that is joins Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 on which two years followed later the foundation of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland was involved in the frame of the Interkosmos program also in the space research with Soviet satellite, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became after the Czech Vladimír Remek of second Interkosmonaut.

The lifting of the law over public-spirited works is no solution.
In the past week, the constitutional court canceled the law over public-spirited works.
This decision evoked a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to observe the problematic nature once of a wider perspective from.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of the unregulierten of economic competition.
In the end effect, this means that the single economic systems in a permanent conflict stand together.
Cause for that is the principle of the free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of the private capital that goes with unrestrained finance speculations hand in hand.
Based on the large differences of the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions.
Under this concept, a condition is to be understood, more favorably were with which the manufacturer tries, through importations in the economic competition to exist in that he "underbid" the competition in order to tear through it a larger market share at itself and to increase its profit.
In the large standard, this means for most businesses to transfer its fabrication abroad or to shop there favorably, or to abandon however its business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparably high cost of labor.
Because the private capital bears no social responsibility and therewith also no responsibility for unemployment caused by it, the country editions climb of necessity.
This situation yet is reinforced in that the Mr. entrepreneurs are absolutely indignant to pay its taxes and to replace through it the damages caused for society as a whole economic and social by them.
This situation is generally well known so that concrete statistics are superfluous here.
The ruthless practice of the private capital creates in the single economic systems a situation, in which the governments see forced themselves, to step in competition together, in order to sink the social level of the own population artificially and to attract therewith foreign capital into the country.
In other words: The governments deliver the own population without consideration on the social consequences to the private capital.
This expresses itself especially in changes of valid laws.
It that own population to force in addition is goal of these measures of accepting the dictation of the private capital especially in the wage area.
This happens to the one through economical compulsion in long-term unemployment, to the other through the circumcision of the employee rights.
The result are growing poverty, as well as always larger differences between arm and empire.
In Germany, there have been already for some years public groceries duty places for arms, that are no longer in a position, to eat through own work.
The amount of the concerned goes already into the millions.
In the course of the increase of the competitive stature the German economy it comes regularly to cases, in which employees receive a so slight wage, that the country must increase its income to the existence minimum.
Such a scandal became also in the case of assistants busied in the German Bundestag uncovered.
The savings measures practically all EU south countries will run out undoubtedly on the same condition, with which the people are forced under the pressure of a catastrophic fall of its social level, to hope to emigrate (like it in the 19th century the case was), or for a hunger wage at the edge of the company to darben and there on that that sometime private investment capital will flow into the country.
Does here impose comes itself nature appropriate for the question, from where this capital?
If it comes out of one of other EU country, poverty of a country in the other hikes solely; or the capital remains work equally very from, for in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco or Egypt and/or in Africa generally the employed for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns entirely Latin America.
Liberal theories and media maintain to the disgust that the country may not itself with capital at its own economic system of involved, and that planned economy leads to the economy catastrophe.
The private capital persists narrowly on its standpoint that the country may not interfere directing into the economy.
Then one must ask himself however whether the private capital does not influence or quite directs the politics and therewith the entire country in the own selfish sense.
Here the unambiguous answer is: Yes.
The proof for that is the existence of a practically almighty and in all countries omnipresent lobbies.
The result is is a despairing situation in the area of the corruption, the mutual before division, a legislation, in that practically all punishable, but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is so that a state ministry delegates lacking finances private, thickly with the industry entangled right business with the elaboration of drafts of a bill.
These drafts of a bill are dismissed subsequently in the Bundestag.
All force comes then no longer from the people how it announce the western constitutions, but rather of strong finance groups, that prefer its own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies run describes presently quickly into a situation, like it Appian in its work to the crisis of the Roman republic at times Cäsars and Pompeius' : "The country was grasped were occupied already for some time in the ruin, and the offices with force.
Against bribe, through illegal Erschleichung of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption proliferated unrestrained, and the people went with already bought voices to the choice"... "People with character did not apply had" himself for offices, so that the country as a result of this decline for eight months no consul... "One began to speak already really about that that the single medicine in this heavy situation would be an alone domination, and that a strong man selected become would must"... Appian thought at the same time to be sure of Pompeius, but the strong man was then in the end Cäsar that the democracy replaced durably by the alone domination.
How appears, the current company is based just as as in the antique on the ruthless preference of the own advantage without paying attention to for society as a whole interests.
The private capital is not already of its nature here in a position, that advantage to recognize and to put through for the entire company.
The result, today like at that time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elite, that themselves not in the slightest around depth issuing reforms strive.
We must the cause for the recovery of the fascism and communism therefore in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems in that 19th and 20th century seek.
Of the current condition out of seen, can be looked at the downfall of these regimes for the benefit of liberal democracies as a certain recess, with which the next round already is outlined.
Especially catastrophic the fact is that the current elite the losses possible in the future by hundreds of thousands of human life, that humanitarian and social catastrophes, whose witness we are already today as well as the crimes against the humaneness, how we know it out of the older and newer story, in perfect ignorance vis-à-vis stand.
The lifting of the law over public-spirited works is here no solution, at least no durable.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced, also to seek further ways, in order to press the social level of the population downward.
This trend is therefore system contingent.
The single solutions are aimed politically social reforms, that increase the capital participation of the country at the economy, that influence of the citizens raise to the government and the monopoly position of the private capital in the company weaken for the benefit of the country.

Israel: Laboratory of the chaos.
Sting in the song fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain reads, sings "... that nothing out of force emerges, or ever emerge could" : Do not forget „...damit we, are like fragile we".
"If my sons no war wanted, would give it no", says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of the force between Israel and the Gaza Strip, it gave, like always, an immense number of reactions.
The one stand behind Israel and argue designate with its right on self-defense, during it the Palestinian as a terrorist; the Palestinians support the other again, argue with the racism of the Israeli country, with the genocide committed at the Palestinian Arabians and designate the country Israel as terrorist.
I would not like to write here about that, who in these always recurring waves of the killing more indebted and who is to victim; in the end the current inhabitants of Israel became including the autonomy zones into the present political situation there innate and even did not experience the start of the force.
It goes me therefore to open the readers the view behind the scenes, that view on that, whom the 95 years serviceably are tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Near East above all.
My thoughts rely partially on accessible historic facts, others are derived from this and go out of my own understanding therefrom forth, who authoritatively influences and/or which group of people the events of the modern story.
The story of humanity is primarily a story of the fight for the power.
In every epoch, we can settle an Alexander the large or a Napoleon.
That what is less evident, the question is whether it were really always these personalities themselves, that determined its steps autonomous, or whether behind its throne someone stood, that its deeds on a before certain goal directed.
We must admit ourselves that we live in a time, in which the wealth of the world in the hand less more individually concentrates, and that this concentration of the money and the power following from that did not emerge within the life span of a generation.
Under these astronomically rich families does not stick out designate could one especially, that one as a head of the Kraken (I knows, whether over them yet someone stands, I latch this however not out of) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written over it.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought of the Rothschilds already in the '90's of the 19th century in order to stop the connection its by the name of with highly criminal deeds, in whose background always the establishment of its power, that stood increase of its fortune or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries, in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or mobilize itself on this (before the attack on Afghanistan were it 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq were it 5 countries, after the slump Ghaddafis remained only four, whereby Russia in the meantime its central bank of the Russian government imputes has).
To oppose who also always tried, this family, had to pay with life for that.
Abraham Lincoln rejected it to renew the status of Rothschilds bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war to publish own (sprich: national) banknote and was murdered 1865 in a theater.
J. F. Kennedy began to publish own banknote and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered 1963; the delegate Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned 1936 after he wanted to accuse the FED because of from solution of the world economic crisis in 1929.
The global Machtgelüste of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan to the Entfesselung of three world wars through Albert Pik, a free mason of the 33rd and therewith highest degree of the insight.
The first war had should be broken should reduce create as a goal, to remove the large monarchist country beings of Europe, by the second war especially the colonial domination of Great Britain, and the third war the world population on approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (such an amount would become for its convenience and its luxury provide and would become also not so many resources consume), an universal religion (the Ökumenismus is here nothing further than the forefield) and Lead in the end to the acceptance of the absolute power.
The method, with which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works at the tip, is the from solution of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order out of the chaos).
These solutions are however incorrect and lead always to the aggravation of the situation (see foundation of the FED, therewith itself crises such as that of them in 1907 released do not repeat).
After it was arrive them through the murder of the Habsburger Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo, to release the first world war, they destroyed the Russian czar empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the annihilation of the Russian czar empire was the war no longer required), subsequently resulted the solution of the Central European great power of Austria Hungary.
In order more simply to be able to kindle the second world war, let create the bank through the politics a latent conflict situation in that they covered Germany with gigantic war reparations; through it created it the prerequisite of become impoverished measures so that they had to pass off the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, who named the indebted and offered simple solutions; a further factor was the creation of the much people country Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, that the function one Fifth columns take in should and took in also in order to kindle the war fire.
The Rothschilds initiated end of the 19th century the foundation of the zionistischen movement, with which a branch strove for the foundation of a Jew country, if possible on the historic zone of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return after Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour declaration created the prerequisite for the measure immigration from of Jew to Palestine; it came to first collisions with the resident Arabic population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second world war broke out, and whether now Hitler of the chain off tore himself, at whom it the international banks initially had held, or whether all ran after plan, is to be estimated only heavily, created in any case the sorrow of the European Jews in the concentration camps the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish country through the world partnership.
Israel was established in 1948, and just as as by the war reparation against Germany the ground for the second world war prepared became, places the declaration of the country Israel the creation of the focus for the third world war there.
If it will succeed the international banks, to unleash this war, the Jewish people similarly in the second world war becomes the victim in the frontmost battle line, this time together with the Arabic and/or Muslim population of the Near East.
Israel is like a gigantic laboratory, a source of the dispute and the chaos, not only in the country even, but rather also internationally (one would keep in mind only, like sharply itself the people in follower and opponent of Israel subdivide).
Who is releases the indebted and who the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israeliten, where wrong only wrong in an endless spiral of the force, stood where at the beginning of the greed more individually and its striving after global power?
One must distinguish here between the inhabitants of Israel and its leadership, set yet the international banks in Israel just as as here, that people, exclusively its own candidates to the choice.
The present prime minister of Israel, the falcon Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism susceptible, the international banks of loyal inherited politician that all does for that in order to kindle a war with the Iran, which could expand in view of the membership Irans in the Schanghaier organization for collaboration (China, India, Russia, Pakistan. ..), quickly to a global conflict, and in that it because of the inspection Irans over the only 2 miles would extend street of Hormus Run over that 20% of the worldwide petroleum deliveries, come could to a destruction of the international economy.
In which light the words appear there David Rockefellers from the year 1994: "The only what we need, is will welcome" one all encompassing crisis, and the people the new world order.
In its presentation, the new world order is a world of the gentlemen and slave.
A world in which the remainder of the human population of a small group of finance aristocrat serves.
A world, in which every new-born in the birth a chip is implanted, in order to subject this being of the total inspection.
"And it makes that the small and the large, the empires and the arms, that give themselves free and the servants altogether a time sign at its right hand or at its forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he would have then the time sign, namely the name of the animal or the number its by the name of.
Here wisdom is! He who has intellect, that considers the number of the animal.
For it is a person number, and its number is six hundred sixty-sixth".

The film Argo: If it stands most badly, call Hollywood
In November 1979 occupied a Mob of demonstrating Islamist students the US American message in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For whose release they demanded the extradition of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, that was implored after the revolution into the USA, that had preserved over decades the patronage over its regime.
For the American government, there was no positive exit out of this situation - it was not able to afford it to throw the Shah over board because this massively would have damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
Simultaneous it was not in a position, in the Iran where the revolution flowed into the installation of a theokratischen regimes to put through the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow for the call of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of the hostage release made all only more badly.
That caught were released taken diplomat in the end after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated through the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages evoked at home a wave of the solidarity as well as antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in the Iran contributed considerably to the defeat Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben ape leak describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small part victory.
Directly before the occupation of the message, the flight succeeded six message colleagues.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
It succeeded helped the CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the fugitives out of the Iran; at the same time them an extravagant story to the Verdeckung of its true identity - it traveled camouflaged with Canadian passports as members of a film rod, whom nominally in the country film location visited for a Science-Fiction-film.
Combination of the genres
That of the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed made plan also the collaboration Hollywoods required.
So that the disguise became trustworthy, articles appeared over this film project in trade journals, it were held off press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were held long secret. The film relies on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Ape leak film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one side, it is a realistic Politthriller, simultaneously however also a so-called. "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a gelungenen of hussar piece such as for example the film Ocean's it Eleven.
Through it the mood plains change themselves in the film from - on the one side the Dokumentarszenen out of Teheran (in the title sequence become ikonische contemporary photographys shown, and also in the film frame of the same situations gives it no large differences).
On the other side the loose passages from Hollywood, that ironically and easily exaggerates come therefore.
And then there are yet the scenes out of the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the discussion table, on the office halls, at the telephone...
Ben ape leak a remarkable new start of its career is arrive with this film.
Out of one, actors smiled at became a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is now no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is its third feature film after the Krimi no children's game (Gone baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).
It is simultaneous ape leak first film that does not play in the native Boston of the director.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place belonged at the same time to the features, that removed the prior films of this director of the standard Hollywoods.
Ape leak proves this feel however also in Argo where Teheran becomes "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show really taken place have the reconstruction of events, that - the entrance sequence of the Erstürmung of the message is in its clarity very impressively, and the feeling of the confusingly-ness and the unpredictable-ness that enters mediates at the same time nevertheless, if somewhere once the story moves.
A similar effect obtained ape leak with its team also in fictional scenes (the incorrect film rod on one was based in Teheran).
Too much action on too many places
The director had to explain himself also therewith that the story does not offer actually many scenes exciting in the filmischen sense.
With the few, it works however quite successfully whereby it helps reality sometimes something - what then not always so elegantly causes, (the scenes, in which the threatening crisis on the airport in Teheran of a telephone call in America turned away becomes, or also the pursuit hunt on the runway, cause something gekünstelt).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide dispersion that is stipulated by the necessity of having to show too much at action on too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in its rolls to be sure very charming as Hollywood colleague, its figures would have earned however more room, and therewith they stand in the film by far not alone.
Ape leak film loses through it something at pulling power. It is a film that one pursue with certain interest and can at the same time the formation and the Retro style remembering at a Thriller out of the 70th years goutieren.
It wakes enthusiasm however only heavily.
As a memory of an until piece in certain manner living today story and as a proof its, how the presentations by the almighty and omniscient secret services covered are yet, is it however sufficiently.

Guidelines for the inflating of air balloon, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, that annually a survey exclaims over the most absurd bank fees, concluded this year to arrange the competition ordinance "most absurd and/or idea out of the EU workshop".
"On this idea brought us the plan proposed recently by the EU, a woman quota of 40% in the management of large European firms to introduce", said Patrik Nacher, that attends to the organization of this survey, vis-à-vis the newspaper Právo.
Under the nominated absurdities, the judgment of the European court is for example over the unification of the insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until there, women wetted an advantage in life insurances because they represent a slighter risk for the insurance companies objectively.
"Further incredible ideas out of the EU workshop can be nominated until end of this year.
The actual voting results then until the end of February 2013", divided Nacher with.
To the controversial EU ordinances, the binding addition of organic ethanol belongs among other things to fuels, that is in its consequence nature damaging, the further the ban of the dependable mercury thermometers only because these contain a relatively slight quantity of this danger material, or also the guideline to the size of chicken cages, because of which this year eggs more expensively became substantially.
Criticism harvested also the factual ban of the use of the concept in the past "Butteraufstrich" or also the sale ban for conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be long 14 cm
The EU apparatus decides often under the pressure of this or those lobbies out of trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are represented as a rule of one or several member nations, (so tries the Czech Republic presently for example, also with veto threat the demands of Czech banks to put through).
Lobby interests stood also behind it that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and may show no "curve anomaly".
The European commission defended itself at the same time with the argument that it would harmonize solely the inconsistent single national standards, that would hinder the trade.
The standards regarding fruit and vegetable were softened of the EU against the resistance of some countries already with the reference that the previous guidelines would lead to a waste of groceries.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is possibly the EU ordinance of the past year, that equipped will must in accordance with air balloon in the sale with the reference, that children may not inflate under eight years the air balloon without supervision of an adult.
The EU referred at the same time to an American study, that in accordance with air balloon the leading cause are in asphyxiation death of children.
A similar restriction applies already to children until 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are strange ideas also at home
Relatively absurdly also a guideline, that is concerns the European officials themselves - every, that in the EU an official function takes in, the label Macedonian may not use because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must say instead FYROM (form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky. com nominated in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez fair next to that above mentioned. Absurdity also the EU ordinance on the circumference of groceries supplies in the field of a member nation.
The EU determined joins be might therewith the highly volume at groceries supplies, that at the day of our EU it in the field of the Czech republic.
The Czech Republic exceeded then for example the determined volume for fungus canned food for what a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were impressed also of the idea that certain countries money should receive for that, that they have no sea, or to give however of the idea, promote moneys for proposals on promote moneys.
These ideas came to be sure not from Brussels, but rather from Prague.
"We are handicapped in that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement in the EU", explained the at that time country Secretary of Commerce Jaroslav Palas in the autumn 2004.
As an argument, it led on that the grain harvest had been very high and the national warehouses as a result of that so-called. Intervention purchases overfilled were.
Because the Czech Republic would have a further way to lake harbors, the EU should pay Euro according to Palas hundreds of millions at us.
The European commission came the Czech Republic in the end so far toward that it organized an announcement over the purchase of grain out of countries, that have no access to the sea.
Promote moneys for proposals on promote moneys offered the ministry for regional development under direction of minister Pavel (US DEU) to the communities, concretely should concern it at the same time means for the Aufsetzung of Fördergeldanträgen at Brussels.
EU: Bizarre ordinances are the exception
Ordinances are earned in the member nations to be sure easy to the target of the criticism, the efforts of the EU around regulation of and therewith also around effectiveness and development the entire European Union in the opinion of some experts however sooner recognition.
A more serious problem the EU promote moneys are in the opinion of these experts sooner for projects, that jointly have purely nothing at all with the involvement of the European integration, that were forced however in the household negotiations by single member nations.
Emotions also the fact evokes in this country that the Czech Republic of labels specific similar to other member nations in Brussels around the right on use of traditional products must fight and not always wins this battle at the same time.
The Czech Republic was able to defend to be sure the label after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria "Olomoucké, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský around), whose tradition go back here into the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename however in "Tuzemák".
The label around may be used only for products out of sugarcane distillate, not for products out of sugar beet.
In the official list of the product registered in the EU, Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker of marzipan or the Parmaschinkens immerse also that in the company of the world-famous cheese sorts now Karlsbad rusk, carp from and or also the Saazer hops up.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the rolls can themselves there breasts.

"The people want, that I the republic would rescue, but I am bare an amateur", maintains Okamura.
Mr. senator, how does one come on the idea to run for office for the office of the president?
It does not go me therefore to be senator or president.
If in our country of all without problems function became, I would run for office nirgendwohin.
But I can no longer with look at how the republic is plundered for 20 years, how thieves freely run around, while the person the taxes and the retirement age are increased.
I had no ambitions to become politician.
If I see however something, what does not please me, I try to propose a solution, in order to change this.
And there I already over 40 am, and in addition independently and impartial, have I no other possibility to influence the things when for the office of a senator or the president to run for office.
Into the senate, you created it and got going then immediately into the castle.
Do you not turn through it your voters the back?
I said the entire time to myself that I will receive the fight for the castle after the result of the senate choices.
Later I specified and said this that I will run for office for the office of the president, as far as I am selected to the senator.
My goal is not however the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For that I need if possible much influence and an as strong as possible mandate.
The difficulty exists however not only therein that we scold as a people in the tavern and before the television, but massacre everyone, that something wants to change.
In addition the media that want to steal one the honor come confuse, and to lie that the freedom of the word with the freedom.
Over me was maintained for example that I would bribe journalists or that I was adviser of Paroubek.
Let's speak over your visions.
You received the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive fortune explanations over 20 million crowns.
In addition you must change laws.
As a president, you have no competences in this regard, and only the senate as entire can bring in legal proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I intervened that the guide remains a free business, and this could be put through.
The problem is the small intellectual politics - if someone comes of to the right or of to the left with a good suggestion, intentionally is rejected this, and the population holds that only up.
As more independently impartialer, I order to win over a by far larger potential, support in all parties represented in the parliament.
My advantage exists therein that I can take myself without Schubladendenken and party dogmas of every party that, what kind of country the best is.
Do you see yourself as a person in the politics sooner to the right or to the left?
From Czech point of view seem to me that the people see me sooner to the left.
For me, this to the right-links-thinking are however totally unimportant.
For me is important that we advance.
It does not go me therefore whether someone belongs to the left or to the right warehouse; I would like to connect the people.
Always I support publicly every good attempt toward implementation, also if this comes of that or of the ODS, and just as I will turn against bad ideas.
It displeases you if someone designates you as a Populisten.
You do but confirm that not through it, what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a firm, have also an ideal goal and a vision.
You would like to approach and this.
One can designate this on my account as a populism, but function became discusses all suggestions of which I spoke, in the world already, or it of important expert.
But without support in the parliament, only slogans remain you.
And therewith you come in the politics long-termed not far.
Do or mine you that it you, if you speak only long enough with the people, succeed becomes to put through for example the material and criminal liability?
I have no other possibility.
To convince and to try politician, journalists and the public, to bring it on our side, in order to put through these goals.
As a president, it would be for me no problem to request the chairpeople of the parliament parties live on television in addition, to anchor the material and criminal liability for politician, official, judge and district attorneys legally.
And the addressed would have to say then where appropriate why they reject this.
A strong personality that refers to corruption can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct choice of the president that was a salary of the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find ally for my views and visions.
With the politics, I began just recently and try to find the support of the majority for my program.
I try always to judge the things themselves; and if it out does not work, go I again into the private sector in six years back.
That sounds a few as if Okamura the Czech Republic should rescue.
I am no rescuer.
I know, reach that I alone nothing; therefore have I with several well known personalities about spoken whether they would not like to run for office also for the senate.
I spoke for example with Radim, that rejected however because of work overload.
Moreover I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, that uncovered the fraud in the trade with easy heating oil.
I began my candidacy with the prerequisite that the people are deeply discontented, but now I am certain no longer.
Sixty percent of the entitled to vote did not go at all to the choices, and that that went, representatives of the Establishments selected usually.
In the senate, we are therewith only two independent.
The people selected such a senate composition that changes will be only very heavily enforceable.
Nevertheless I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct choice of the mayors and district captains.
Do you think about the foundation of an own party?
About that I did not think yet because I have no time to review the past of each potential party member, and also not at all the money for that would have.
I have not yet once money for the president campaign; on my transparent account, solely 20,000 CZK are.
Do you have no money?
Express you would see of fortune explanations, how your?
I estimate my private fortune to be about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot of land with a value of 25 million, a dwelling for about 10 million, a further for 8 million, an art collection that is about 10 million valued, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and one Škodu Superb that about a million is valued. And then I have another couple of millions on the account.
The Aston Martin a child dream was by the way - James bound pleased already always how he went in the car, gallant to women was me and badly fought simultaneously against that.
Do you go an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the republic, but you would not like to invest your own money therein.
That is not just convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make about guilt?
I stuck already 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program wakes certainly not all too much interest.
And I am not obligated to challenge the campaign out of own means.
The costs for the campaign are taken covered in the reason through my salary as a senator.
But of the senator salary alone I could not live; so I could not finance for example my son the English school, that costs 30,000 per month.
If I wanted to earn only money, I would run for office for nothing at all.
Do you remain therefore further than an entrepreneur active in order to have your livelihood?
Did you not say that you will cut back these activities?
But that does not hold together with the height of the salary.
How promised, I partially cut back my activities.
So for example my representative in the spring manager of the travel agency becomes.
The people want to see me as a samaritan, who rescues the republic.
But I must live yet also of something.
At which monthly income were you accustomed as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also further so.
As a president, I entirely would adjust my enterprises however.
You find the complete conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.

The MVRDV architects prove, are that the true adventures not only in the head - by the example of Spijkenisse and the most young erected book mountain - 2 photos

The 80.000-Einwohner-Gemeinde shows the lowest development rate of the entire Netherlands.
In order to work against this stupid circumstance, to contribute concluded one some years ago, to the general standard of education and the seven fictional bridges, that are represented on the Euro certificate, when pretty bepinselte reinforced concrete miniatures to reconstruct.
The success of the development offensive was limited.
And so recognized the city fathers that there would be only a single possibility to become the statistics gentleman: A library must here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdamer architecture office MVRDV, master of the rash beam charts and maker of witty, often cynical constructed, took the thing with accustomed composure and appear to the competition Hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grinning in the face.
And during the jury yet baffled around itself looked and twitched with the shoulders, piled up bolstered the impudent Maas its selected presents of the size after to a pyramid and concluded its aktionistisch speech with the words: "Love township"!
That is it therefore, my suggestion for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years expensive mountain later is poured up the 30 million Euro.
It is part of a revitalization project to which also underground garage, supermarket, postal service and a couple belong dwellings adjacent and rowhouse with altogether 50 dwellings.
Beginning of November was priced the book mountains Library "best with the second price of NL 2012".
Moreover the project is nominated for the Dutch nationally Wood Award 2012.
Therewith the faceless town retort is had pass to offer that to date no longer as a postmodern pedestrian zone and a disconcertedly ugly city hall, behind whose white facades one would be tended, to assume a dairy factory, around a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all however Spijkenisse controls now the first public culture building in the story of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under cheese bell.
There are open itself to be sure an elevator, that leads middle through that mountain massive, but the true room joys and harvest joys in the foot Erklimmen of in heat the topography.
That all around inner room glazed is bright and clear, the burned latch ground and the elegant street lanterns speak unmistakable the language of a public city place.
The urban ambience is perfect.
One keeps an already lookout for park bench, dog and soccer playing boy and girl.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally stand the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, that usually uncomfortable and impersonal is", says Winy Maas.
We placed the classic room configuration on the head and the harvest area from within outward gestülpt.
That in the book mountain is used adept: In the middle, offices, Internets libraries, lie chess club, environment center and house technology headquarters.
The black bookshelves, that are once wall disguise, once parapet, once increasing railing, are a special joy.
Optics, Haptik and smell are strange.
Even inveterate architects and building engineers shake whether the unknown building material the head.
"We wanted here with recycling materials work", explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the township Spijkenisse, on inquiry of the standard.
And so we bumped in a friesländischen agricultural business one day into a suitable waste product out of the agriculture.
For many years one has used a millimeter thin Kunststoffvlies in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields as a root document.
That is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile keeps is, two seasons, after that it ripe for the barrier rubbish.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick disks.
Under heat effect and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, robust material, that smells a bissl after new car and a bissl after sport shoe, discolors itself.
After 105 steps, one arrived at the summit.
One is rewarded traveling long at the end the almost 500 meter in the literature café not only with a fantastic prospect for the city, but rather also with Dutch Kroketten and on potted Ficusbäumen.
They provide for atmosphere, above all however for the correct humidity in the literature mountains.
Contributions for the new soul
"One would become it do not believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass areas a show project as regards ecology", says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled becomes with earth warmth.
Although the book mountains under a glass slump stands, the sun itself seems at sunny days only shortly in that in.
The wide Holzleimbinder, that stand diagonally to the glass facade, serve as a tailing and catch a large part of the sun irradiation off.
The room climate is very comfortable.
Fully automatic blinds settle the remainder.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic out of the IT SECTOR, ventured already the way into the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde that the Boekenberg quite as a Spijkenisses "a long time overdue soul" designates.
The reason: To the opening a few weeks ago every inhabitant was invited to contribute a book out of its personal existence.
Therewith the optical spaces in the not yet completely equipped library - presently 70,000 pieces - are supposed to be filled first of all once.
The draft rose.
The shelves are filled until casually.
"Is nothing worse than a half empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, has every inhabitant thanks to our invitation now a certain relation to this new house.
Everyone knows that its book part of this building is.
And if it is only for decoration.
Therewith MVRDV is arrive that king discipline, that one names in the specialty jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse wrote literature story.
So young and uneducated it also be likes.
That is finally a starting point for identity.

Szabo: "German must play" larger role
Germany abstained from voting in voting over the reception of Palestine of the.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert for US European relations, balances Berlin therewith on a narrow diplomatic degree.
German wave: Beginning of the week had signaled Germany first of all that it would agree against the proposal on an observer status of the Palestinian at the United Nations.
Then however Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support that, what the Israelis in Gaza did.
Now Germany must be careful to be sure based on its special relation with Israel.
But simultaneously I believe that it does not support also the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without to be sure too critically vis-à-vis Israel to be.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany abstained from voting also when it went therefore to arrange a flight ban zone.
This was put through in the end of NATO.
Does it fall Germany heavily to relate a clear position in important international subjects?
Yes, that agrees.
That lies that it shifts just its foreign policy and to be sure away of a politics, that became so to speak of the USA gemanaged, there to a German foreign policy.
Impeding arrives that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform politics.
The Germans are found therefore between the fronts against.
One expected of them that they do not play a more independent role, on that are it however accustomed.
I believe, they feel itself yet at its roll up to, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy how they have France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean then concretely from German point of view?
It shows are independent the readiness to relate in national interests also positions, that of which the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, therefore of the exports and its relations to regions, about Russia, China or the Near East determined.
Germany economy interests are to a certain degree unlike that of the other large powers and therefore must Germany its interests protect.
Did these economy interests influence have on the bearing in the Mideast conflict and the voting in the UN?
To the one, Germany has large paragraph markets in the Near East, especially in the gulf countries.
Therefore it must be careful, the public, but also the elite to not to knock in the Arabic countries before the head.
That plays in any case a role.
But I would want to ascribe that also not too much weight, am that no relation one-sided totally.
But it plays in any case an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany damage its relations with the USA in that it abstained from voting in important decisions of, about in the voting over Palestine?
I believe, rule in Europe and even in the USA large understanding for the German position.
Therefore I do not believe that this was a so dramatic breach, like in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will warm up therewith even one certain respect.
For it signals yet that it seriously are taken as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The USA on the other hand talked things out clearly for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?
Based on the American domestic policy, these dissimilarities always existed.
I believe that the government has secretly probably rather much understanding under Obama for the European position.
But based on the political situation here, publicly naturally cannot represent the government this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are all so large not at, how they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and prime minister Netanjahu, Obama is enthused not at all so hellauf of Netanjahus politics.
Does it fall Germany heavily to arrange its narrow relations with Israel and the USA on the one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe, make exactly that it so hard for the Germans.
It would be natural a little simple for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European politics, what presently the case is not.
Therefore they cannot be part of a wider line and must push instead things out of its own position.
They make that just with the Euro.
I believe, will receive Germany in the future a leading roll to press Europe to a European position.
That is naturally not simple for Germany, already because of the relation to Israel.
That was always already a sensitive subject.
But I believe that is clear to the Germans, that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself in the roll see itself as an important international player - wants Germany generally a leading role receive?
Does Germany or fall the leadership role yet heavily and heavily?
Germany is not accustomed yet on that, that is yet always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, falls it the country yet heavily and heavily to play a larger role.
If we look at for example the Euro crisis, there become each time if Germany supposes a larger roll, most varied anti German feelings freely.
That does not make it the Germans simply.
That is actual the old problem: you does not want to surround be of hostile countries.
So seen is Germany in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be impressionable for most varied neighbors and opinions and is that not simple.
Does now the influence of the USA in the European politics not decrease fills remains continuously, that EU this vacuum however, who there in the moment otherwise?
The Germans will have to play simply a larger role.
Also if it does not please them, it them unpleasant is and makes it yet much unpopular - c' est la vie!

"Brand-name protection" in China: If Puma and Armani become sudden Chinese
Armani is an universally known brand, Polo Ralph of tepids also.
What is however Armani Polo?
Behind it a label very officially registered in China, that has to do to be sure nothing with the origin businesses, hides.
Nevertheless it enjoys so long protection how the actual name givers do not complain.
And even then is not clear whether they get right.
"It becomes more and more for foreigner more difficult, its brands in China to protect", says Thomas stalemate hole, lawyer in the office Taylor Wessing who is specialized on protection breach of the law in the far east.
A new case lands each week on my desk.
The imitators rich letters additional already a couple so that they may register its brands.
So will let register out of Gucci simple Lu Gucci, instead of Prada one Prada Kny.
Also German businesses are copied in this manner legal, about the sport article manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a file with entries of the brand-name office in Beijing.
On the 14th of September 2010, a Chinese business the trademark Zegna DF Puma let protect there, an art name that made use of also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champion in the copying and in the injured of intellectual property, is well known.
In the large cities, there are multistory department stores that sell almost excluding forgery.
Stalemate hole of cases however are differently: On behalf of its clients, it advances on the other hand that Chinese business of the brand-name office receive very officially the right to use a label, that is protected already elsewhere.
The Chinese name that "anxious Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word orients itself towards "anxious Dakuan".
Therewith women are meant, who catch rich men.
The Chinese authorities are themselves no guilt aware
"That is geschäftsschädigend, one must it fight", demands stalemate hole.
"The brand is diluted, that disappears all attitude, the image damage is enormous".
The financial losses and the process costs of the concerned industries go into the millions, above all in expensive show products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion is Euro in the year the third largest market for luxury article and the at the fastest growing.
Yet cancellations of suspicious entries in the brand-name index are to be reached and are to be gotten heavily expensive.
Up to nine years, the procedure can move itself, with uncertain exit.
Stalemate hole reports of cases, in which the court complaints rejected, because after the long duration of that name objected to become would be the "market reality".
If the complainant would have bad luck, he had to pay the plagiarist even money because he injured its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases concern also graphic elements.
Daimler lost 2009 a lawsuit with the building machine manufacturer Sany, that business that recently the German concrete pump farmer plaster master received.
The Chinese may use therefore until today an emblem, that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue white Logo that reminded one of BMW; the dispute became had to change geschlichtet, Geely it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitator from Hong Kong and Singapore that the famous crocodile let view into the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are themselves no guilt aware.
The brand-name office CTMO in Beijing admits to be sure that it had given there 2010 because of to slight personnel equipment and room equipment bottlenecks.
In the past year, one would be returned" however of the "need situation in the work flow to the normality.
So the existence of unfinished objection procedures had sunk around 22 percent.
One had locked almost 57,000 of such cases, 75 percent more than in the preceding year.
Nevertheless wait in the office of still 81,500 objections for settlement.
To concern on the other hand much costs
How so often in China the numbers are impressively.
In the past year, more went in the CTMO than 1.4 million proposals on brand-name protection on, almost one-third more than 2010.
Let a record be that and mean that China would cite for the tenth time sequentially the list of the new registrations in the world, divides the authority with.
That applies also to the existence of all valid trademarks, altogether 5.5 million pieces.
2011 had been taken in 1.8 billions of Yuan at fees.
Simplified that is named that each registration costs on average 1280 Yuan or 160 Euro.
To concern on the other hand a multiple costs how the case of the German family business joy mountain shows.
Since more than seven years, the group against a Chinese plagiarist fights.
To be sure the Germans were able to reach that its illegal fabrication imitated motor vehicle part was excavated.
Yet the imitator secured himself further the Chinese rights at the brand joy mountain.
One himself would have that neglects because in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairperson of the management of joy mountain Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand-name office CTMO rejected the objection of the citizens of Munich then also.
In the next both instances joy mountain got to be sure quite, but the process opponent fights until today further.
One must pay attention infernal
Now the matter is pending before the colonel court.
Wentzler is confidently, to bring the thing to a good conclusion, and the professionalism of the courts praises.
But it says also: "The procedure is extremely costly and costs us much time, money and nerve".
The internal costs let do hardly number themselves, the firm archive had to look through even one hundred year acts old in order to furnish proofs.
Five years ago joy mountain of the opposite side offered in vain a "high six-figure Euro sum" to the settlement.
"On that sees one, like much us that is valued", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the far east threaten slosh back even to Europe.
If there imitators secure themselves unprotected brands.
So a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the label joy mountain for shoes and leather.
The group abandoned this business field a long time, nevertheless it was able to turn away the registration.
"One must infernal pay attention", says Wentzler.
Both it and the lawyer stalemate hole advise German business in addition to be in businesses with China very careful.
Do not suffice should to depend on international brand-name rights, rather the foreigners "all, what somehow is worthy of protection, also in China register" how Wentzler says.
Otherwise that can become much more expensive than the registration.
In the deed: If joy mountain would be subject in the last act of its brand-name drama, one would have to pay probably the opposite side license fees for the own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pressed in the questionable segment out of the market.

World Aids day: Tramp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland are happy Aids orphan about that.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First the tramping is there: Cowboy boot, basketball shoes, lady pump and Herrenslipper seek the tact on the parquet ground, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then first the voices of the singers swell slowly at - old, bass, tenor and soprano - oppress, betören and pursue themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, lifts it almost out of its material shoes if he brings together it with its pliant wild gestures.
It is rehearses Monday evening, in the music room of the institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi a new song.
At the fifty singers and singer came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin to the house man.
"Om' Obani" no simple piece, each choir voice is still has another text and this also in a very strange language: Zulu that is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts by Swaziland.
Aid to the self-help
Worldwide there is appreciates approximately 34 million HIV infected, that Unaids, the program of the United Nations to the Bekämfung of Aids.
23.5 million people therefrom live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 Aids orphans live.
More than 40 percent of the population are in the meantime HIV positive.
For 180 Aids orphans in the village Esitjeni, the society found Voices for Africa godfather in Germany.
70 of them visit a continuing school.
For 15 or 20 Euro per month, one can receive a godfather shaft.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means on Zulu story narrator or also praise prices.
The Bantusprache fluently speak can no one in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years the choir of songs in this strange soft language has practiced and diverts it and at also there back where they originally come: into the south of Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies of Heidelberg removes, in the northwest of the kingdom Swaziland, gives it the village Esitjeni that depends on the voice force of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live are there, many yet in simple clay cottages and straw cottages, a large part therefrom children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents because these are succumbed the HI virus.
In Esitjeni appears in the small on what entirely Swaziland suffers: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the masculine foreskin, that diminish the contagion risk demonstrably around the half, are hardly supposed of the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry is the immunodeficiency virus in itself to die with middle thirty no rarity.
In a joint Africa trip in the spring 2005 discovered the choir the village, above all however saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, which it lacked not only at parental care, but rather simply at all: Eat, clothing, development.
Without diploma, one has no chance in a poor country first quite.
Originally it was yet the private engagement more single to send for a couple of Euro in the year a child to the school and to enable it a warm meal at the day.
The choir later established yet already a year the society "Voices for Africa" that attends since then almost professionally to the Aids orphan in Esitjeni.
Facts to sexually transferable infections
What are the most important sexually transferable illnesses?
To the bacterial STI, syphilis, Chlamydien and Tripper (gonorrhea) count.
Frequent viral STI are HIV, humane Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and Krätze belong to the parasitical STI.
Who are the main party concerned groups?
Syphilis and Tripper occur above all with men, who have sex with men.
The Robert-cook-institute assumes that at least four are transmitted by five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany by sexual contacts between men.
At the heterosexual adults, Chlamydien infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (fungus), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren are frequently occurring sexually transferable illnesses.
The distribution of HIV is in this country comparatively slight under heterosexual adult - nevertheless: Approximately 20 percent of the HIVS new infections fall to this group.
Under youth, Chlamydien infections step substantially more frequently on than in other population groups.
After European elevations, three-quarters concern people young all infections between 15 and 25 years.
In this country humane Pappilomaviren occur moreover with youth frequently.
How did the number of the infections develop?
All sexually transferable illnesses are not reportable.
The number of the syphilis infections has according to the Robert-cook-institute of 1697 diseases per year 2001 on 3698 diseases per year 2011 more than doubled itself.
The number of the HIVS new infections has returned since 2007.
There were 2011 approximately 2700 cases.
That is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
Which symptoms refer to a venereal disease?
The infectious diseases can evoke abscesses in the genital area, troubles in the Urinieren, outflow, lower stomach ache as well as blister or wart.
Often they cause however no pains or other symptoms and remain therefore unseen.
How can one protect himself?
Condoms can decrease the risk of a contagion, offer however no hundred percent protection.
For in part pathogens can be transmitted by sexually transferable illnesses also by grease infections and narrow body contact.
Therefore experts recommend above all regular investigations with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed most STI can healed and long-term consequences avoided become.
Through godfather shafts, contributions and not finally the salaries, that itself the choir throughout Germany ersingt, meets a few things.
"Altogether have we already round 200,000 Euro after Esitjeni sent", says Annette Lennartz, the chairperson of the society.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and execution strong woman, the moneys administers from Germany.
It is concerned also therefore that the orphans find accommodation well, with one of the grandmothers about.
The Gogos how one names the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Many of them received up to 14 orphans with itself, give them a roof over the head and provide that the children in its uniforms appear every day punctually to the school instruction.
He who has no one more, comes becomes into the protection house Khanyisile, a single woman, that just as of the society paid like both cooks, who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover "Voices for Africa" called a vicinity school into life, constructed two chicken houses and organizes jointly with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have make let a HIV test.
That is is no basic assumption, for so obvious the illness in the entire country also, one is quiet it most dearly dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it with sexuality to do has".
Actually strangely in a country, in which the kings officially 14 wife holds itself.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Mswati III., is well known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things it is owed also this nationally sanctioned life form that the HI virus in the past decades so quickly spread out.
But also the many wall workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms to be sure at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but that will hardly use.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh".
Around the cultural exchange something to promote, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years jointly through the south of Africa and sings songs of full melancholy, battle spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many know at the southern point of the Dark Continent yet out of times of the Apartheid.
Sing a bus fuller whiter, the songs in a black language - so much recognition brings has not only mood and joy, but rather also already many a grim boundary soldier a couple of tears abgetrotzt.
The trip leads always also after Esitjeni where the singers visit its godchilds.
Also if one does hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than well known.
"Goes to Esitjeni, there is say the light" the people there.
And if one returns the 8733 kilometers as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the tramping singers in the sample room at the Bergheimer street, sees illuminate one it also there.

Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the mercury
The probe messenger found proofs that it gives mercury on the planet ice.
The ice cover should be thick possibly up to 20 meters.
The US space flight authority NASA proved the existence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although it lies the sun at the next, there is also there frozen water how out of studies published three on Thursday in the specialty magazine "Science" follows.
The probe messenger had found proofs that there is an ice cover in the region lying permanently in the shadow of the planet.
This should at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters be thick.
The water came probably of comet or possibly also asteroids, that are hit on the mercury.
No one would bring the finding of ice however with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the boss scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the mercury can until to 426 degrees centigrade reach.
The findings could help however at the same time to clarify how water and other building blocks of life arrived into other areas of the solar system.

One of the largest and sharpest receptions of the Hubble telescope: The whirlpool galaxy
According to Farbgebung, receptions become to preserve of Spiralgalaxien works of art.
The reception published by the European south observatory shows removed that several thousand light years Trifid fog in the constellation of protection.
The name Trifid comes of the Latin word trifidus (dreigeteilt, dreigespalten), there dark dust strips the glowing heart of the star birth site dreiteilen.

Also this star cloud, connected with the Rosetten fog, produces running new baby stars - 5000 light years of the earth removes.
In this brightly radiating galaxy with a small black hole, yet no dust exists, but rather only gas.
Researchers assume that he emerged first shortly after the Big Bang, when in the universe predominantly hydrogen was to be found.
Our insights in that all: The most important telescopes
The telescope should have been invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - yet before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to the star observation.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became more and more larger - and the insights that deliver it, always deeper.
For 30 years, the Hale telescope in the Palomar observatory, namely of 1947 to 1975, was near San Diego the largest telescope of the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows views in that all immediately over two mirrors, every with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The thoughts and feelings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Kanareninsel La Palma is tremendously - alone of the mirrors comes on 10.4 meters in the diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - around costs to save.
Nevertheless it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable method of building: The telescope is in its height angle festgezurrt - and therewith in its mobility restricts.
Also the hobby-Eberly-telescope in Texas is fixed in the height angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light collecting power.
This passes namely - in spite of comparatively slight mirror diameter - at that of the mirror telescope largest worldwide up to.
By means of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers monitor that all after extraterrestial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), every computer owner can help in that he makes available computing power.

Here the Very Large Telescope stands - that its name all honor makes.
With its altogether four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate also the middle infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its head mirror should comprise satisfied 42 meters - and out of nearly 1000 mirror elements together set become.
With pictures is to be calculated however at the earliest 2018.
Until 2007 counted both bold telescopes on the hawaiianischen volcano Mauna Kea as the largest of the world.
They offer immediately two mirrors with an average apiece of ten meters.
The bold telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-observatory that looks next to them yet with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF into the sky.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, gigantic telescope should emerge - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an illustration to marvel at.
The most important impressions out of that the space telescope Hubble all delivers however.
Since the 24th of April 1990 it has delivered already pictures from a distance worlds.
Since March 2009 the space telescope Kepler has searched for extra solar planet - especially after such, that are inhabitable.
On the 2nd of February 2011 was announced of the Nasa that 1235 planet candidates were determined since mission start.
In the picture, the last start preparations are documented at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) becomes all shot at the earliest 2018 on board an Ariane5-Rakete in that.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should search for light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that also at the south pole of the mercury ice exists.
To be sure there are for that no reliable data because the messengers circles far more closely at the north pole around the planet.
Radar measurements pointed for decades on that that there is ice on the mercury.
Through the 2004 started messenger probe - the first, that around the mercury circles -, the scientists have now certainty.

Drink daily butter - and 168 years old become
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country in which 97-year-olds are yet comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country in which 97-year-olds are yet comparatively young.
The trip through the Talysch mountains is to be named wild romantic.
The small bus rumbles over the winding street, past at thickly wooded hills, tearing rivers and simple farmer houses.
Everything is green and juicy, one could mean, one would be in the Black Forest.
The deepest south of Azerbaijan, the boundary to the Iran is is removed yet that here only a few kilometer.
Here the caucasian ethnic group of the Talyschen of which much well known is not lives, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserisch and is very durable.
Terminal is Lerik.
The small village shows off with to mightily advised architecture out of Soviet times, that wants to fit so not at all into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe come is conveys hardly here, to onerously that of Azerbaijan capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, one needs eight hours because the street is only single-track.
The incredible wealth, that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian sea, did not arrive here in the province yet.
Yet Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the thing to the tourist attraction.
"Baku became in May with the Euro vision-song-festival famously - and in the next year have we here a festival of the oldest people of the world", says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen is documented out of the area, that shows more old than 100th Fatulayeva on a black-white-photo.
That here is my grandfather, he became 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years another child witnessed
Yet disputed star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Müslümov that 168 years is supposed to have become old.
There is not a birth document to be sure.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who became 122 years old, Müslümovs age appears yet extremely doubtfully.
"1805 became it here in the region born, 1973 died it", clarifies Fatulayeva.
The man would be married been three times and had had 23 children, should have witnessed at the age of 136 years he another daughter.
Did Müslümov reckon itself therefore in its age around a couple of decade?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of the Hochbetagten in means Asia.
"Incidentally many highly old would jut people gives it also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "also in Sardinia live extremely many very old men".
Because of missing documents, no scientific proof is to be led however over the age especially since Personenstandsregister were missing.
Butter goblet wise melted every day
Fact is however that the people of the region reach all around Lerik incidentally frequently a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are older than a 100 years.
Why do therefore so many Hochbetagte live here in the south?
The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva on the other hand believes that it would lie at the nourishment.
Yet that calculated so healthy be should the food of high-calorie the Talyschen, appears that meat, bread and above all milk products of dear and, of which many drink daily a glass of melted butter, out of nourishment scientific visibility also not exactly plausible.
Is it or the original way of life that the people young holds? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement close to the city Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is extend for this yet comparatively young.
Mirzayeva that maintains to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wood house, that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It sits on the ground with a churn, that rolls here it indefatigably there and.
Eight people live are here under a roof, under that one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both a long time grandparents.
Also two infants jump around.
In the kitchen, one prepares the guests tea that is served in that typical, belly-shaped Armadu glass.
Teeth white Mirzayevas stand conceals perfectly in row and limb, under its scarf it long, dark blond braids that its son reveals proudly before us.
I washed my hairs always with milk, went it myself never from and retained its color.
"Shampoo have I also never uses", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension passes for life
It ate always only that, what came of its own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I long did not buy my entire life a single time in the supermarket groceries.
Then it tells of its man, who was in the army.
Most badly it was at the time after the second world war.
Yet everything became received better, than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew the oar.
The propaganda sounds strangely out of the mouth of an old woman.
Yet the cult, that is driven around the father figure of the nation, that be reigned country such as a dictator, knows hardly boundaries in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, it was received at the power, later its son Ilham the oar.
Nevertheless there is no need under Azerbaijan of old.
230 Manat (about the same sum in Euro), receives Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for local ratios a sum of which one can live well.
And perhaps also Mirzayevas has a long time grayed son quite: "The old enjoy respect" in our culture.
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, umsorgt and are happy.
If that is no reason to remain as long as possible alive

The word "human right" is missing in the constitution
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep split of the country.
The future constitution with the shariah as a basis is violently disputed.
The president branch Egyptian not with pathos.
We must create the transition.
"And that he succeeds, lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God", said he in the national television.
Its speech was directed, above all however probably to the Christian Kopten, at the entire people the liberal, enlightened Moslems and secular.
For it everyone, previously hopelessly quarrelled in a confusing opposition, have anxiety.
Fear of a theocracy at the Nile of graces of the powerful Moslem fraternity.
It has, said Mohammed Mursi almost excusing, that competences of the constitutional court pruned temporarily and its competences expands, "around the revolution to rescue".
Yet, what the 61-year-old engineer really wants to rescue, who carries a doctorate of the American university of south California,, about that the egyptians are themselves, is themselves the world not entire in the clear.
Is the judiciary supposed to be deprived of power?
Actually the 234 articles, that of that are Islamist dominated whipped through became 100-member Verfassungsgebenden meeting there in a nightly, 15-hour Parforceritt, partially apprehension exciting.
How in earlier shape also it is named in the design, that to the right" would establish jurisdiction on the "principles of Islamic.
Yet what is named "principles"?
That was and is stands interpretation thing and it to fear that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the therewith walking juristic latitude for a more severe interpretation of the shariah.
At least a newly there brought article suggests that: In all matters relevant the shariah, the al-Ashar-university zurate would have to be pulled, the most important Islamic institution of the country with large ray power in the entire Sunnite Islam.
That must not, but it can mean that the clergy inspects the legislation, what would have de facto the Entmündigung of the judiciary as a consequence.
Much in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation thing
Also problematically: The civil military courts and tribunals should maintain remain further.
These courts served during Mubaraks domination to the suppression of opposition.
After the slump of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The country should also, stands protect it in the design, "the true being of the Egyptian family" "and promote" its moral and its values.
That is formulated juristically so fuzzy that national institutions could control by means of this article even the contents of film art and literature.
In the clear text, that means nothing other as a censorship.
No article by the way estabilishes specifically the comparison of men and women.
For that forbids another to insult or to slander the prophet Mohammed and its envoy.
What however an offense is and is supposed to be punished how it, remains unclear.
Just as suspicious the formulation seems, that forbidden would be "offense of people".
Does a caricature of the president or a joke pass there already on costs of a jurist?
Interpretation thing how so much in the design that Mursi exists to the signature and will become the egyptians after its words "very soon" the referendum presented.
"The revolution is returned"
The opposition has formed itself for weeks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousands of met itself in unaccustomed harmony on Friday evening on the Tahrir place in Cairo and praised to bring the charter to case yet before it can step effective.
"The revolution is returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the presidential elections.
Peace noble prize winner and former boss of the international atom energy authority Mohamed el Baradei explained, the constitution design belongs "on the rubbish mountain of the story".
Via short intelligence service Twitter, it accused the followers Mursis to want to lead a "coup against the democracy".
"If it the referendum exclaims, become we its palace go and it fall", said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet gesühnt", quoted the Egyptian media the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced to not to want to supervise the referendum by what means it would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well organized Moslem fraternity did not blow on their part to the against demonstration, as a precaution however on the Tahrir place, but rather after a measure prayer on the other Nile bank before the Kairoer university.
Women and follower of the Salafisten disguised took many on that part and called: "The people demands the application of God law".
They demanded of Mursi: The country" "cleans! and assured: "The Koran is our constitution".
A fight for the highness over the symbolically significant Tahrir place, on which all took its beginning, would have conjured up probably civilwars-like conditions.
Mursis followers not very obviously wanted to risk that.
The Moslem brothers explained, both the opponents of the constitution design and the advocates would have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now let the time be, let decide the people at the choice urn, in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the design of the Islamists counts as certain.
"The word human rights does not come once before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furiously over this forced constitution process, that go would have actually to the February and should bind all social powers.
The 48-year-old person lawyer and chairperson of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Moslem brothers when they sat under Mubarak in the prison or stood before court.
Because it would not divide its world view, but rather because for it human rights are indivisible.
For that it was beaten, was convicted, arrests.
"And now stands the word human rights not once in the new constitution", will lament it in the conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi power expansion on all three forces in the country let resign the lawyer.
These measures are striking offences against democratic game rule and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the civil company to strengthen, would set the president it de facto except power", laments Saeda.
Yet without civil social organizations, a democracy could not function.
Saeda feels let alone, also of the international partnership, that observes the ideological direction battle at the Nile with a mixture out of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "Your gebährt a monster, that its no longer control can".

Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the most smelly fish of the world?
One of the highest standard of living enjoy the five million inhabitants of Norway - and that not only in Europe, but rather in the entire world.
Could the success secret of the country have to do something with the local appetite for rather smelly fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese sorts.
Place it in the middle of a pile more dirtily, damp sport clothing.
It and leaves there a week.
So approximately one must imagine the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the large delicacy of Norway.
I am removes in the small city Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo.
There is here snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that not simply wants to disappear.
Rakfisk is best regretted fermented becomes with salt trout, that - dependent on, like stink one its fish gladly would have - to a year in water.
If in Norway the darkness comes over the country and becomes the weather colder, stream norwegian to a festival here in Fagernes, that is dedicated this, now, to really very bribing specialties.
"One eats it raw and rinses it then with a glass of aquavit down", says Havard Halvarsen, that works actually in the local fire watch, but as a so-called "Rakfisk general" also the festival arranges.
Around us around people consume fish cubes small and take in addition large quantities at alcohol to itself.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk", says Havard.
The Spirituose can displace the smell.
I cost some morsels.
If one avoids it to bring the Rakfisk in nose vicinity, it is not bad - about like Sushi, that has a quite long bus trip behind itself.
Rakfisk is the product of an entire other, by far poorer Norwegian epoch when there were yet no cool possibilities and fish in the autumn in airtight brine casks was soaked.
In the deepest winter, it was taken out then after long Fermentierung and - undoubtedly under with the help of senses softened by alcohol - was consumed.
Before a generation saw cable would send himself norwegian in search of work forced to leave its country and hiked mainly into the USA from.
Today the population are awake rapid - more than 13% are immigrant, lured of a flourishing labor market, high wages and a comprehensive public health.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, that by far pass was as Norway before not yet all too long time, stream immigrant.
Rakfisk is looked at as something important - as an essential if also exertally smelling part of the Norwegian story.
It belongs to the more expensive courts, that one can buy himself here.
But actually is here yes all expensively - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 Euro.
Norway does not create it often into the world press, and that does not seem most people to disturb.
Here one hates to name it still, differently Breivik in the name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot last year 77 of men, women and children.
Instead one has reference only to the "occurrence of the 22nd of July".
Norwegian have trouble therewith, to accept that someone is capable in its peace-loving country to such brutal murders.
Mainly responsible for the current wealth of Norway the growth of one of the largest oil industries and gas industries is since the early '1970's the world.
"But oil is not the single reason, why it us so well goes", says Anna, our waiter, the round trays with ripe Rakfisk distributes and ideally embodies with its long blond hair and the pricking blue eyes the Nordic.
We are a - how says one - circumspect people.
Your English is exact like that of the most people here immaculate.
We are not very ostentatious, we like no bragging.
Norway very carefully handled its oil wealth - a large part of the industry yields will invest to the welfare of future generations into a special fund.
When in the years to the world economic crisis all with money threw around itself, that it not at did all possess, held locked Norway its money stock exchange firmly.
"As long as we in the winter ski go and in the summer hike go can, are we happy", says Anna.
"And naturally Rakfisk eat", joins it with unencumbered laughing thereto.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court at - of Rakfisk have I enough.
Such a moose castle is in any case something else. The juicy meat mundet me.
But in the evening again the stink fish stands on the menu.
The hotel in which I room is one of several venues, who organize a Rakfisk Dinner, with which guests can agree for the best - or perhaps the senses of smell of at the strongest demanding - fish.
There is a live-TV-control to a Showmaster clothed with fly that is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Euro vision song Contest.
"Which score do you have there above in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"
"Here our points, Havard" are.
One klatscht and laughs.
A man falls overwhelms of its chair, possibly of the aquavit.
But perhaps it is yet the severe vapor of the entire fish.

Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto stands before difficult start
While Mexico of future Präsident Enrique Pena Nieto on its assumption of office prepares itself, analyzed Grant of the BBC wants the challenges impending it and the mixed feelings of its people.
The traffic in Mexico city is current very especially bad.
Even at better days, this is clogged one always city, but on Monday a ring was erected out of steel, that closes off several important traffic route into the capital and provides on the streets for chaos.
It was not the goal however to disturb commuter on the way to the work, but rather to prevent demonstrators on that, to reach the parliament.
On Saturday the president bandage will receive Mexico of new Präsident Enrique Pena Nieto and will receive the leadership of the nation.
It stands before a complex task.
Under the separating government Felipe Calderons, Mexico was able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the handle of a drug war, that cost in the last six years already 60,000 human life.
"My government becomes involved strongly for that, the force to reduce", explained Pena Nieto beginning of this week in the oval Office the US American Präsidenten Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can reach this goal.
Before it went with the US president at eye level, Pena Nieto was as a governor of its homeland country Mexico active.
In this thickly settled, extensive part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions are divided over the new country chief.
A direct man
In the remote town Valle del Bravo, one remembers for example gladly it.
Inhabitants of the vacation place attribute it the development of the tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, one can go on one of the freeways, that let construct Pena Nieto and represent the one large improvement vis-à-vis the brittle, uneven streets, that there was here once.
Badges with its name hang also outside of a modern sport center and an impressive interactive museum to climate change.
"We expect of it real and continuous variations", so its friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, that as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, that PRI works.
We hope, especially, what concerns the security and economy, for an interesting and actual variation, that needs our country so urgently.
After 81 years at the power, the PRI in 2000 of Vicente Fox was removed.
The congresswoman Olvera admits that the party places large expectations after 12 years outside of the president palace of lot Pinos at Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president false it at substance, rejects he.
It would be engaged and would have a very direct man, very large plans for the country.
Let he be an outstanding statesman, above all would be he however also someone, who can listen.
But on the other side of the country, many people do not divide this view over its earlier governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also well known as Ciudad Neza, could be not larger the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo.
The place lies hidden under freeway transfers and places in regard multifarious a suburb of Mexico city even there.
And the problems in the community are of decisively urban nature.
Beginning of this year was turned on the military in order to fight the drug volumes operating in the quarters, and force against women is an especially acute problem.
On a spot fallow in the vicinity of a large dump the corpses dutzender of murdered women were put back alone in the last two years.
While the tenure of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the country Mexico over 1,000 women - a statistics, that exceeds even that of the city Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its force and the murder of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are the view that he is concerned the problem of the woman murders during its tenure at least not appropriate.
Yet in the worst trap, its government had locked its eyes before the problem.
In a concrete building, Irinea Buendia with the tears, typically for the come down quarter, fights when it shows me photos of its deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events according to Mariana committed 2010 suicides.
Yet its family believes that it was murdered by its companion.
"As I in its home arrived, seemed it, as would be its body washed become", remembers Senora Buendia.
There was sign that it was struck, and the rigor mortis already had used.
While its mother tells its story, a picture of Mariana looks of the wall at us down. It is mounted next to a cross, that carries a single word: Justice.
One had forbidden yet exactly this, so the family, its until now.
The authorities treated me, would be as I a Schwätzerin, trouble-maker, grouch.
They would want that one simply accepts its judgment and holds the mouth.
"But that is not possible, if it so many irregularities and failures gave", says it.
If Präsident Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday the president bandage, it accepts therewith also a large responsibility.
Families Mexican ten thousand were affected the last six years by violent crime in, and the new president promised to attend during its tenure especially to this problem.
"I hope, when president is he so, like he as a governor was", says the PRI congresswoman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
Yet exactly before that the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are afraid most.

The district attorney's office maintains: Bradley Manning had not complained about misuse
The district attorney's office contradicts Bradley Mannings accusations, it had been mistreated in the prison
The hearing concerns itself with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense strives for a rejection of the accusation based on to hard prison conditions
Is reproached for the Gefreiten of the US army, cable would send stolen confidential documents to have
The district attorney's office tried on Friday, to assess that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - accused for the largest uncovering of confidential information of the US American story - neglected several opportunities to complain about the misuse nominally suffered by it in military custody.
In a cross-examination Mannings during a before judicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden finely that documents to weekly visits, that prison officials had undertaken during Mannings of nine month custody time in Quantico, Virginia, showed, no complaints about at all its treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, that as a result of a proposal of the defense to the rejection of the accusation held off became had stated would have considered - Manning would be through the hard custody time already sufficiently punished become - Manning, it in the prison the suicide.
The secret service analyst of the US army who was arrested in June 2010, is reproached, cable would send stolen confidential documents during its tenure in Iraq to have.
The material was published of WikiLeaks on the Internet then.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as a source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday went through finely with Manning the forms, that officials had filled out after its meeting with Manning during its custody in the Quantico military prison, where he resident had of July 2010 until April 2011 under reinforced prison conditions.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote its answers to.
When fine it on Friday to the forms questioned, Manning admitted that it had judged the treatment through its watches as "excellently" and the treatment through the arrangement altogether as "very professionally".
The forms, so finely, contained no complaints about misuse although the officials Manning had questioned directly to its treatment.
Manning answered, it had expressed its objections orally and would have discussed and indicated the officials this with it to concern itself with this. They had not been recorded however.
"You wrote down (after discussion of the objections)" no problems", and that did not mean said of necessity, that I generally", so Manning to nothing.
The judge, colonel Denise landed, asked Manning also why he did not complain about its treatment, when he met in January 2011 with a from shot, that the suicide thoughts mentioned by it some months previously on a form should examine.
Manning answered, had existed its intention during this meeting therein let stage down its observation status to the "prevention of injuries".
The military stated, it had shown this restrictive status - the step one under the suicide threat stands - to its and of the protection others to it.
"I wanted colleague therefrom convince, that it me well concerned, and the observation status to the prevention of injuries get rid of (..) a from my viewpoint higher quality of life reach to can", said Manning.
Manning stated to its arrest and placing to Kuwait on Thursday where it was held approximately two months, before it was transferred in July 2010 into the prison of the navy basis Quantico in Virginia.
It said, had considered in Kuwait it the suicide and had become based on the heat once unconscious.
To not to be allowed to know, what would happen with it or in the outside world, had been onerously.
"My world shrank on camp Arafjon, on this cage together", said Manning on Thursday.
I thought, I would die in this cage.
When it was transferred after Quantico, Manning had spent the large part of its days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
One had permitted it only a mattress, a cover, Flip flop, clothing and its glasses.
Manning said, it had tried to remain in movement, for at the day, it had been forbidden, to leave to sleep itself or also only.
Always it had to sleep with light, that penetrated from outside into its cell.
If he had turned around at night and watches be see could face no longer, had roused one it so that he turns back himself again.
Mannings lawyer raised in January 2011 formally objection against the treatment Mannings.
Manning became in April 2011 into the military prison of fort Leavenworth, Kansas transfers.
On Friday questioned the judge Manning also to an accusation, that it in its statements on Thursday raised had - so would have must sleep it a night naked in its cell in Quantico and stand in a morning counting naked before watches and other prisoner.
Manning had stated, it never had had the opportunity during this counting to cover itself with its cover.
In the inquiry on Friday Manning indicated had concluded, he from a command of its watch that he should fall let the cover, with which he would have been able to cover himself. It admitted however that it no one had requested in addition.
On Thursday Manning had stated that it was forced in the prior night in addition to sleep naked. He would have tried before to show an official that he would represent no danger for itself.
Manning had said the official, he would not have been able to use done the alliance of its underpants or its Flip flops in order to injure itself, this however.
In this night, stated Manning, would be its underpants, Flip flops and glasses out of its cell removes become.
Its lawyers hope that the judge at least would consider its custody experiences and its custody measure drastically would diminish, should convict become he in its negotiation before the court martial. This is prepared for beginning next year.
The defense indicated that Manning will admit guilt slighter offense for, while other accusation points that are looked at than to extremely are supposed to be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is prepared for this weekend. Of the district attorney's office, a justification of the prison conditions is expected.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was held in accordance with the determinations, that apply to all prisoners guarded under the highest security measures in Quantico.

It is found threatens in all accusation points for indebted, it a lifelong prison sentence.

My Mexican American identity crisis.
Many people would be forced based on the missing chances to left Mexico
Mexican tend in addition to accuse the emigrants - it call them difficult times into the memory, says he
Navarrette is the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On one recently trip after Mexico city I had crossed and had arrived just recently the hall at the passport inspection when helplessness in me extend made itself.
Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").
I stood there some seconds long, unsteadily, to which I should proceed me.
I grew up in headquarters California and was named my entire life long "mexican".
An ethnic shorthand symbol - exactly so how my friends in Boston "Iren" or my friends in New York name themselves "Italian".
Later I decided on "Mexican American".
But that here was Mexico.
And in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no requirement after shorthand symbols or dash.
I was simply only American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough in order to maintain myself in this language at both ending of an interview.
But I do not control the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I become not my American accent either loose.
Therefore I took my American passport and stood into the snake for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment of this week when the future Mexican Präsident Enrique Pena Nieto visited the white house in order to meet with president Obama.
On the agenda, all those subjects that one expects stood, if the heads meet both countries: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was interested also very on that to speak over the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that mexican remain nowadays with just as high probability in Mexico instead of emigrating into the United States.
He would like to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block after example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drugs cartels, also if it named relating to this no details.
Mexico relation to the United States is complicated and full resentment.
Most Americans never waste probably a single thought that the United States in 1848 in Mexico occurred and forced the leadership of the country under reproached weapon in addition to leave more than the half of its territory to them.
But for mexican, who do not think in centuries and in minutes, memories of not to are surveyed this event.
As soon as therefore a US government official practices criticism also only mildest of Mexico, one - in the Mexican press and under the elite of the country - hears troubles about how the Americans oppress the sovereignty of its neighboring country.
And the children Montezumas proceed on the war path.
And yet the largest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relation with the more lies than 35 millions Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Speak desire to over resentment?
There are more than enough.
Winner and loser has Mexico. People for whom the country chances offers, and other for which it does not do this.
The single reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles live, read Vegas, phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, exists therein that at a point in our pedigree a person - perhaps a parents parent or large parent - got offered no chance in Mexico and emigrated toward north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - swarthy, uneducated, out of a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithful counts them.
Not Mexico.
And although we live perhaps now the American dream, good schools visits and receive have good jobs, may lose live we never out of the eyes that it is the American dream, that we - not the Mexican.
Our identity blurred sometimes if possible, but what concerns our loyalty, this is not the case.
This counts unambiguously the United States.
In addition we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class do not like us.
This is based upon mutuality.
They see us as a memorial of a humbling defeat and view on us down because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish never will be good enough, our volumes to Mexico never strong enough.
According to your opinion our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families were not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not be caught see ourselves now behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but yet somehow lost.
My wife, who were born in Guadalajara and immigrated as a child legal into the United States, remembered that between mexican and Mexican Americans tensions exist, because mexican possess a clearer presentation about that, who it are me - and Mexican Americans take them this vile.
While she is US American citizen, she sees herself as a part of these countries.
To belong yet many Mexican Americans whom I know, have the feeling, neither to the one yet to the other country.
We love the Mexican volumes lot Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys is the best of both worlds, but in none of them rooted.
In Mexico, we are seen as American.
And in the United States, we are seen as a mexican.
How I should learn during my trip, there is makes something, that this relation yet more complicated: Some Mexican leadership people and parts of the development citizenship would like to receive its connections to the Diaspora again.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, that represent its interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleague therefrom how crazy a visit of this country is and exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify its ties to Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unjust distribution of income, the unbridled corruption and the drug force many of us are certain not at all so whether it concerns really a crazy country.
I fear, must there its alone through, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some mexicans are not yet ready, to forgive the United States for the contact with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept also that some Mexican Americans cultivate a grudge, how its members of the family were treated first before not at all so long time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are thought "More mexican", than I.

Old combats, new Near East
The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could prove to be an unexpected main pillar for the peace
Can there be ever continuous peace between Arabians and Jews in the Near East?
The newest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the middle of the usual guilt assignments, countless buildings in debris and ash were put, more than 140 Palestinians, that therefrom civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time are hit rockets out of Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolises tels Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Yet although Israelis and Palestinian in its historic conflict seem caught, changes the near East around it around.
The Arabic spring did not create a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or - Palestinian and Israelis became part of these confused.
Perhaps this will lead only to more bloodshed.
Yet there are reasons to the acceptance that the deadly stalemate situation could find finally its end.
A war, that neither lost yet won becomes
On the first view, optimism seems in view of the current situation all other as mounted.
Even if the armistice arranged at the 21st of November stops, the dieswöchigen battles the Hartgesottenen strengthened on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas, who Islamist movement, that has controlled since 2007 the Gaza Strip, will maintain of itself to have driven back the Israelis although its grouping had to indicate even large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gazastreifens in one of the most wretched and thickly most populated corners of the planet are corralled, it is not arrive Israel until now to destroy the Hamas.
Actually the Hamas in the West Bank gains controlled becomes, that by the competing, moderated Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the end that they have the time on its side.
So, how Islamists in the Arabic world won at influence, the Hamas was able to pull powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, an again gaining strength, regional power, that counted as Israel of narrowest Muslim ally once, seized for the Hamas party - exactly like Qatar, one of that pass and most dynamic gulf countries.
Rejoicing Hamas followers believe that around Israel an Islamist crescent moon forms - of the Lebanon in the north where the militant Hisbollah has the power, over Syria where rebels of an increasingly More islamist stamp could stand before the Stürzung Bashar Assads, up to Jordan where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And especially the ascent of the Moslem fraternity under Präsident Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the country inhabitant strongest and most important Arabic with distance - at the southern flank of Israel persistently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot, who reigned Egypt to its slump 2011 for 30 years, had only little time for the Hamas over.
In contrast to that the fraternity with the Hamas is intermarries and its leaders stronger of people views dependent.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could prove to be a participant, who cannot be squeezed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners on the other hand let pull an opposed conclusion.
Militarily seen is the Hamas no more danger.
The Israeli rocket defense system, "Iron cathedrals", was able to prove itself and were destroyed many of the Hamas rockets.
At least a while long more quietly will be able to sleep Israel.
In diplomatic regard, the United States hold imperturbably at its position firmly. Many European countries responsibly made the Hamas for the newest force escalations.
Israel issued, especially under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, it in last years well that ignored the peace process to large parts.
Although rockets killed out of the Gaza strip since 2004 about 30 Israelis, the country remained relatively free of suicide attempts - not finally thanks to the barrier plants, that into the West Bank and therewith in the main parts of a contingent Palestinian country in stray. These protect expanded become the Jewish settlements, that were declared to be sure to be people illegal, however always further.
Netanyahu stands there well. Its Likud party allied itself in the forefield of the choices on the 22nd of January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even more aggressive group.
Why do also these cunning Palestinians pamper and leave an own country to them?
Did if they have actually the control of the West Bank, they would become then not exactly like its comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip also rockets discharge?
No, it is better to hold and to punish it behind the wall in chess, should venture it it to lift the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail. Yet the Arabic spring could make them a stroke through the calculation.
Even if the Islamists, who sit in Egypt and in other countries now at the power, remaining have, few for Israel, they will concentrate first of all on the difficulties in the own country.
The defense budget of Israel is larger than that of its four Arabic neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arabic governments hardly in the restoration of its economy.
To reach that the pragmatic president Mursi got together itself with Barack Obama, around an armistice, a promising sign could be - and perhaps the start of a new era symbolize.
Also Israelis should think more long-termed.
While the remaining Arabic world undertakes timid steps toward democratization, Palestinians are robbed further its self-determination right - a powder keg, that will explode undoubtedly one day in the Israeli occupied zones, exactly like this week a bus in tel Aviv exploded.
The suppression undermines already now the democracy in the Jewish country, and with the growth of the Arabic population, this situation only will worsen.
Bloody missions to the repression of the Hamas in the Gaza strip will demand over the years increasingly its diplomatic tribute.
Both sides require an impetus from outside
The correct answer is that, that of the sensibler representatives of both sides, whom large part of the remaining world will represent and of this newspaper: Two countries with which Israel to security purposes lectures zones.
That - for the near future small - hope exists therein that the armistice of outsides more influence to the execution of this solution grants.
Egypt must stop jointly with Turkey and Qatar now the weapon deliveries into the Gaza strip and better positioned than ever before, expanded through zone exchange and a joint Jerusalem, to convince by the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish country on base of the boundaries of 1967.
Outside Arabic nations should move also the Hamas and Fatah to a unification.
Therewith would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian country than with the impending proposal on UN observer status.
Also Obama must contribute its part in addition to move Israel to negotiations.
During its first tenure, it neglected the presentation of its own peace plan.
Far removes seems in the white house it, as would be it just as a participation disinclined.
Yet that is a deplorable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have an essential interest in a stable Near East.
And in addition a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians belongs.

Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging become effective
Health warnings and became ill body part on neutral green packings, that are same for all tobacco brands
The laws first worldwide for uniform cigarette packaging and tobacco packaging stepped in Australia effective. Therewith Markenlogos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive covers, that are imprinted in addition with drastic pictures, which show sick body parts and through cigarette smoke sick babies and children.
Of the different health warnings and pictures once seen exists the single difference between the packings in the brand name, that are printed in more identical, small writing, as of coming Saturday.
Therewith Australia introduces the regulations most severe worldwide for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to divert young people of the smoking in that the glamouröse picture of the tobacco consumption is removed.
At the same time the government of studies goes out, that showed that people, who did not begin with 26 yet, to smoke,, with 99 %- iger probability also after that no longer begin become.
"One can already with children of young age see, that it the message understand, the tobacco groups with its brand-name picture to apply try", so federal health minister Tanya Plibersek. It quotes studies that showed for example, that children associate the crown of a Logos with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia shows one of the slightest smoker quotas of the world and the changes will affect only negligibly the profits of the multinational groups, other countries consider already similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
So it was named would be favored, with which laws the black market trade, what would go to cheap and more easily accessible cigarettes.
"The laws become serious, unintentional consequences lead", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer by far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Other on the other hand say that the laws boosted its business.
Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notices in that the demand enormously increased after cigarette cases and silicone cover to the cover of the intolerable packaging, since the groups British American Tobacco, Britain's failed it imperially Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco of two months ago uppermost Australian court with its attack of the laws.
Zico had sold and would wait up to 6,000 units at wholesale trade businesses for new supply.
For us, that is a good business.
According to expert is the hooks in the popularity of social media about exactly the population group, at which the plan arranges itself.
A row of Australian laws banished tobacco groups out of the TV advertising, prohibits it them when sport sponsors to appear and forced most dealers in addition not to display cigarettes in businesses more long. Now the tobacco advertising is changed into the Internet.
The Australian government forbid Internet advertising through local businesses and sides, possesses however no influence on international sides.
"Who tobacco markets and only a small area remaining has, around its products to apply, comes around the Internet not around", says Becky Freeman, researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman assessed a climb at reports to brands, that were composed by "entirely normal people".
One must ask himself the question: Does the merely one private person, who find so large favor at Marlboro cigarettes, is receives, that it for that even a video - or has a marketing agency therewith to do?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry would concentrate instead of on marketing on that to explain itself with the new laws.
It even so far went, the Ukraine to pay Honduras and the Dominican Republic, to contest around the new regulations - those countries complain in the World Trade Organization about unjust trade restrictions although none of the countries operates larger trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for middle 2013.
According to Plibersek the government of conversations with other countries led, that similar packaging laws consider.
Canada was 2001 the first country that prescribed photographic warnings.
Meanwhile these were expanded on more than 40 countries, under that Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers appear obstinately.
The pictures do not influence me.
I ignore it simply.
"One takes itself simply a slag heap and sticks the box away", says Victor el Hage in the purchase of a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly said gives it only a reason why I would stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the pack" in the inner cities of Sydney, says would have impedes, the uniform packaging the filling up of its shelves.
"Earlier have I an hour needed, around a delivery to sort, now need I four", says Yu.
"The government would have cigarettes simply completely forbid should - then would have we us said okay, that was it, we make thickly", joins evidently infuriates it thereto.

In a permanently galvanizeed world, it is beautiful, also to be bored once
This Thanksgiving spent I unexpectedly five hours in the airport when our airplane out fell based on mechanical problems and we on another flyer wait must.
I had therefore enough time in order to make myself a couple of thought to boredom.
I do not want to lie.
To wait a half day at the airport for a flight, is rather nerve-rackingly - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and naturally tax free shopping) are available.
But more and more academician and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
If it goes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be occasionally bored.
Therewith the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting reasonings, what promotes if possible creativity.
And because that of us stare nowadays almost permanently on that on or other screen, benefit us the advantages of the boredom no longer.
Should we welcome the boredom therefore with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
On that I return once again.
How many people also I assumed always that boredom of a relatively current phenomenon is, that developed with increasing leisure time.
Yet Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and Roman story at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of "bora cathedral: A Lively History" (Yale University of press, 2011) that sees not so.
"Actually has the boredom of a very long story", says it.
A Latin graffiti adorns the house walls of Pompeii over boredom, that is due to the first century.
And then yet the question is there how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of the psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada according to the problem exists therein that boredom was defined and discussed on types multifarious.
After long reading material of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Eastwood and its colleagues to the end came professor that boredom as the experience, "a satisfying activity exercise to want, this however to can" cannot be defined.
Boredom differs of apathy consequently indicating that the person is not busied, this however be would like.
In the apathy on the other hand there is no pressure to do something.
The key experience of the boredom, says it, would exist in an "interference of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling, that the time only slowly passes".
Boredom can sound therewith almost so like depression.
But professor Eastwood believes although both conditions in context stand could, see bored people the problem in its environment or the world while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that is boring us, also if we have merely difficulties to concentrate.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining bora cathedral in Terms of Attention" - to German about: "The idle intellect: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention", that appear in September in the trade journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", wise professor Eastwood and its colleagues on an earlier experiment there, with which participants listened a volume, on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program out of the neighboring room, that had to do nothing with the contents. Others heard it on low volume so that it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly audible television, indicated to perceive more boredom than the two other groups - it had problems to concentrate, were able to find and wrote no reason for this its difficulties of the boredom to.
If one tries to concentrate on a difficult or strenuous task, the interference of the attention to boredom can lead, says mark J. Fenske, associated professor for neurosciences at the university Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If one exercised on the other hand a monotonous activity - "so like the search for defective products on a factory conveyer belt, music can distract and help at the same time to not to feel" bored.
Actually, so it says, know even fight can we now that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln interprets, often as a sign for boredom, this in that people remain physically more attentively.
"Studies showed, that children, that herumhampeln may, more learn and more information retain than that, that for sitting still forced become", so professor Fenske.
All becomes us at some time or another boring - my belated flight, a roaring loudspeaker, an especially tiring film.
But some people bore themselves more easily than other.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980 developed years a "scale to the boredom susceptibility".
On the scale, statements such as "many things that I must do be found repeat, themselves and are have monotonous" and "I so many interests that I have not" enough time for everything.
With the help of such scales, researchers found out, becomes that boy more often boring as a girl, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the university west Florida - especially, what concerns the requirement after more and a larger variety of external attractions.
But in general teenagers are a rather exhausted pile.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment carried out contacted, in that he almost 400 teenagers and its parents seven to eight times at the day with a Pager.
It found out that 32% of the growing up were bored in the school and in the settling of the homework, whereas 23% indicated to be bored if they were not in the school.
Yet only 3% of the parents indicated to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he would not know whether the percent shares climbed or sunk with respect to the boredom.
Let he be certain however that "the youth as especially boring perceived becomes", mainly, because children and teenager have no large influence on its everyday life flow.
Back therefore to my origin question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, for in the extreme case it does not lead in addition that people take extreme physical risks on itself and decay the gamble or drugs to mitigate around it - that showed studies.
On the other hand many philosophers and authors examine the relation between boredom and creativity. Professor Vodanovich, that the subject investigates since more than two decades, is this opinion.
"With the boredom wants the brain one say, that one something else do should", so Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not know always, what one should do just best.
If one boringly is and one this energy uses in order to play and to cook guitar, becomes one happy.
Yet television can provide to be sure short-termed for feelings of happiness, these evaporate long-termed however again.
He, who passes therefore an iPad to its bored child, can divert it therewith to be sure of the boredom. It did not learn therewith however to conversed or to control, says professor Fenske.
And it adds: "Self-control transfers itself of a situation to the other".
The child learns not only to converse, but rather more self-control receives also in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Also we should not see it to critically.
Instead our goal should exist therein, well should feel us also to one side of the permanent activity irrigation and technology irrigation.
Professor Eastwood agrees that.
"It sounds so, as would have to be more often boring us. But boredom is the tormenting, unceasing wish to do something meaningful", says it.
It believes that the people in truth search only for a way, to disengage and to relax.
"In an environment, in which we permanently are stimulated over, to busy is difficult for it, itself if the noise is" upset once.

In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marihuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands be becomes in the southeast Colorados for an offense before court, that in this country already soon legal: The possession of some less marihuana chunk and a pipe with which it smoked this.
According to Orozco it and some friends were at a September day with the car in Lamar near the boundary to Kansas underway when they were stopped.
After the police officer had found marihuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalier offense, that respectively with a punishment of 100 U.S. dollars accommodated are - and received a court appointment.
"We become how criminal treats", so Orozco.
Is it but also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the country of legalizeing small quantities marihuana to the own use, depends the answer in hunderten of smaller drug offense fewer on the law, than of the location.
Hundreds of infringements that revolve around marihuana become here and in the Staate Washington, that similar measures approved, already fallengelassen.
The police authorities does not pursue adult over 21 years more long for possession in small mass. This legally is allowed as soon as the new laws in the next weeks step effective.
But district attorneys in the more conservative districts Colorados announced, existing marihuana offenses followiera and quote still people before court.
To the same time, several cities vote, of the suburbs that verse to the Western Mountains about that to prevent from new, national licensed marihuana businesses the opening in its communities.
"This situation develops so quickly further, that I not at does all know, what next happen becomes", says Daniel J. Oates, police boss in Aurora who lies east of Denver.
And also regulating authorities in the state Washington scratch themselves helplessly at the head.
They wait for a guidance to the arrangement of a license system for the production, manufacture, the sales and marketing and the sale of the drug - and have at the same time a time period to the 1st of December 2013 before eyes.
In Washington, one is the view that Colorado in every trap is most countries ahead, what concerns the regulation of marihuana. There the drug became first medical purposes and then to the own consumption legalizeed.
"Colorado has a more strongly regulated market. The country suits itself therefore well to the orientation", says smith Brian E., speaker of the regulatory agency for Spirituosen in the country Washington.
But smith gives also to that no place or system can do more to serve than in the sense of a coarse clue.
"We have no real precedent, that we follow can", joins it thereto.
That Washington law, I named-502, steps on the 6th of December effective and forms legalizes is therewith also the final point of a gray zone, in which the national license system exists to be sure not yet, but the possession.
And unpleasant practice questions must be clarified in this time - about how the national specification of an "appropriate access" is supposed to be arranged to licensed marihuana with the ban by cannabis businesses in the vicinity by 300 meters around schools, park, playgrounds and child care arrangements.
"Nowhere becomes it be heavier, a location for a licensed cannabis business to find than in metropolitan areas, especially in the conurbation of Seattle", means Ben Livingston, speaker for that "center cannabis legal for", a research group formed recently.
On the 21st of November, Chief Oates sent its colleagues in Aurora an e-mail in which he explained, the district attorney not more long would pursue smaller marihuana offenses with people over 21 years, and that the police would strive for "from immediately" no punishment notices for these offense.
Chief Oates added that the police would put through further municipal specification to the regulation of Anbauern of medical marihuana and drug dealers would be pursued further.
In Weld County in the north Colorados, district district attorney Ken represents baked a more severe view.
After the voting, it indicated would pursue, its authority cases of marihuana possession further, mainly in order to move consumer to the withdrawal.
Up-to-date 119 people for the possession of about 50 grams or less marihuana must answer to court although many were accused also for other offenses.
"Our authority has the duty, offences to pursue, with which it itself to the deed moment around criminal offenses acted", let baked be reported in an explanation.
The reactions are even at places such as the rural Mesa County where voters rejected the marihuana initiative, conflicting.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, does not indicate adult for the possession of smaller quantities more long.
District district attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided however also in addition to not let fall all being outstanding possession procedures.
"I believe not, that I my time therewith would waste, the right to prevail, until it changes", says it.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, was already from the beginning clear that it would not be simple to arrange the personal consumption of marihuana with the complexities of government and right system.
And the contradictory reactions in the entire country promoted a far-reaching discrepancy under local official with regard to the large green experiment too days.
With district district attorneys would concern it one "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer out of Denver, that for marihuana offense before court standing accused represents and acts on the spot as a speaker for the national organization to the reform of marihuana laws.
"You have a so large part of its life therewith spent, people for that criminal to pursue, that it the legalization still do not accept can", believes it.
As the first country, the smaller quantity marihuana such as alcohol treat, are been Colorado and Washington as national pattern cases for the legalization about drugs.
While champion and country official prepare themselves for an age of legal sale, they wait simultaneously also nervously for directions of the Federal Government, which wants to treat the sale and the annex of marihuana on federal level further as a criminal offense.
Champions of the legalization movement hope that the justice ministry will give way.
The Federal Government allowed marihuana medical in spite of several sensation exciting arrests by consumer and salesmen the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries to the large part.
Kevin A. Sabet, earlier drug politics adviser of the Obama government is the view that criminalist will enter to be sure probably no doors in order to seize smaller quantities of the drugs, itself however probably sträuben become to tolerate the marihuanas businesses legal, nationally regulated under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado wait first not at all on that that the federal authorities act.
Yet the election day ago some local community administrations approved moratoriums for new marihuanas businesses although these could open not until about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban that is dismissed probably next week concluded.
"We would want not into a position run, with which we someone license and then on federal level before a large problem stand", quaked Nicholson, member of the city advice.
Our community agreed against this change in the law.
We do not arrange ourselves after that, for which the community decided, and after that, for which the country decided.
Yet many questions are open.

Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for its views
Already always it had been my largest dream to received a place at the university Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, that I considered once to be the largest white stamp of the world, for a modern Greek Symposion, that promoted the large columns of the civilization - free thinking and tolerance -.
Yet within two weeks after my entrance in the Worscester College end of the eighty - there had I intended, story to study -, I had packed again my suitcases and had induced so the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening standard, it was named would have gone, I because I would have had a problem therewith, that fellow student in the neighboring room sexes had.
The author A N Wilson declared impish, I the university would have left because I was forced in addition to drink out of damaged cups.
The truth however was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran suffered, for I from systematic Mobbing and threats.
Not based on my quite unusual by the name of, or because I had come of a private school.
One had tormented me only for a reason - a reason, that seemed in this alleged cradle of the enlightenment the more narrow and crueler: My father deceased meanwhile Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser Margaret Thatchers and I advocate of the conservative party.
Why do I mention this just now?
According to now, current reports a new generation of students of the moderated rights suffers from similar pursuit.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford developed meanwhile such dimensions that a group of them demanded last week the same equality protection, that gay, hindered and ethnic minorities of benefit comes.
Conservative members of the junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christ College indicate, they become "often actively isolated based on its political views, personally are attacked and declares" to be undesirablely.
They demand a place in the equality committee of its College in order to guarantee that its opinions can be expressed free.
Aggravated its situation became through a documentation radiated recently over political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", that represented Tories as an Exzentriker and Neonazis.
Therein shown became graduate Joe Cooke, earlier president the conservative student-like union the university among other things Oxford that went in a roll Royce and showed off with silberfarbenem suit and silver occupied walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say be regarded, it as a "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The hatch 20-year-old looked, vice president of the conservative student union of the university Nottingham, let be reported in a Sunday newspaper: "There is some growing links tendency at universities.
The people believe, we are like the Bullingdon club to have become acquainted with without us generally".
Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christs, that the petition initiated for larger protection, is the view, such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student-like union of Oxford says, it would be right with JCR members a growing rejection vis-à-vis students of the moderated observes.
"This places a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members there", says it.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the conservative party had reached its highpoint.
In the preceding year, the university had agreed for that to lend Margaret Thatcher - an earlier student - on the basis of abridgments in the high school system no honorary title.
The atmosphere would have startle let even Stalinisten.
In the first days of the first semester week, with which new students meet and the tutors, I received a foretaste on the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but rather participated even with joys on that.
Political subjects such as the miner strikes, the denationalization and the rejection of the government of sanction against the Apartheid of regime South Africa found its way into the holzgetäfelten rooms of the Tutoriums.
In my first of these organizations, I should translate French texts out of the 18th century into the English. On that, what should come then, I had not been calm.
"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (meanwhile deceased), "translate you please the first paragraph".
I stumbled at the same time.
Pitt was a small man with a face such as out of cake dough, and rather hateful.
Do Thatcher followers "refuse to learn French, or they are simply only stupid"?, asked he me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes, tears boiled.
"I strike before, that it in your leisure time a couple of French hours take - therefore, if you not too very with your social activities busied are", knurrte me Pitt.
I returned with hanging head into my room.
At this evening I sat in the College alone in the supper when someone typed me easily on the shoulder.
It was an English student out of the second year by the name of James who imagined as a member of the conservative student-like union.
"I knows, who you are", said it friendlily.
Unfortunately it is how it is.
Every that is suspected to be Tory, is tormented.
For me, it is already bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher near stands, therefore it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters purport to be follower of the Labour party.
In a local pub tried I later to block me.
I existed on that that I not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion was.
This trick should as unsuccessful prove itself.
A study beginner in the specialty philosophy, politics and economy, that ironic would prove visited had that as a conservatively valid Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You for hours.
Other students divided its opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories sex" have?, asked me one.
Do that strike itself mutually, or?
I felt so how homosexual had to have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would it ever succeed me to lead a normal life at the university Oxford?
Would I be able to encounter like-minded first after break-in of the darkness?
Should I must turn to the Labour party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me extended in my mind's eye to a sweep ivy of the ostracism and isolation.
The single tutor, that gave to recognize itself openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, professor for contemporary story, that had its seat in my College.
It was hated not only for that to be a conservative, but rather also because it had advised Thatcher in things foreign policy and had written for it speeches.
It was only rare there.
It hated the place, found it provincial and narrow-minded and leaned it for its Marxist deterministic Geschichtsperspektive off.
It supposed 1997 a professorship at the university Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You become here not happy become", said it me.
I began to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open friends and members of the family in the city.
My father told I that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
It seemed unbelieving.
During its time in the Vierzigern, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world", said it subdued.
They never would do so something, not in my city of the dreaming tower tip.
Even my communist friends put always flawless manner at the day.
Its damp eyes clouded themselves.
Gib the entire a chance.
I am certain, one teases you only.
It would break me the heart if you went.
Exhausts through my frequent trips after London became my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my masculine friends, also Tory follower, had given way the pressure and renounces its convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, with which a further Geschichtstutor seriously had maintained, let I be "an enemy of the people", decided I me to do that.
Although I dissolved shamed secretly before, I admitted that my parents of a "brain had subjected me to wash", and it named "old zombies".
The relief lasted only shortly on.
It was my father who struck the last nail into the coffin of my Oxford career.
To that time, it wrote two columns in the Murdoch press per week.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my Häscher gave up.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Gladly you can name me a whining weakling.
But no 18-year-old should suffer must ever in a development arrangement from such intimidation and maliciousness.
Is and even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that not only 14 Tory prime ministers produced, but rather until today behind an undeserved call of equality and freedom of thought hidden itself.

Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the single place in the British capital, that is worthy the accommodation of a display over Valentino Garavani.
This has the designer in the opening of "Valentino - master of the Couture" acknowledged, a grandiose retrospective, for which more were assembled than 130 dresses of the skins Couture, that were created by its "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I dear this palace", says it with its unmistakable Italian accent.
This display is the conclusion of a story, whose single protagonist "il signore" Garavani is, that cannot would have written become however without its distinguished clientele.
Valentino perceived always already fascination for the stuffy and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this display, that becomes to see be yet to the 3rd of March, there is a multitude of private letters and photo with the signature of the selectedst aristocracy, begun of the princess Salimah Aga Khan, over the princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to there to lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of its social ascent of the modest fashion maker in the city Voghera in north Italy to the idol of the international Jetsets.
To be in love with the nobility, doesn't have to be of disadvantage.
"At least step it its slag heap not on your lovely carpet from, like it some beautiful fame out of the pop music do", says baron Fiona Thyssen Bornemisza.
In the 60 and '70's lived both in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We everyone pleased us, if we into its house in Gstaad invited became", explains the Exfrau of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friendly with forgotten beauties such as for example Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino preferred always already the elegance of the fame.
And nevertheless it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Also the Argentinian model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to it home to the supper.

At every detail of its dwelling, the decoration, at the meal and at the music recognized and sensed one its influence.
"All invited felt importantly and loved", remembers the "Top model" that began its course in the week of the skins Couture 1995 in Paris.
"It never comes are" says out of the fashion, because its designs works of art it in conclusion..
Fashion show of the origin
Life of Garavani is no story of verse meal-ness, sooner of mutual love shafts.
It likes people with good upbringing and the highest title, and they love it.
One of the gallery in Somerset House was changed in a glorious and 60 meters course footpath long, takes that proposes a roll exchange: the user the place of the model on and goes out along the course footpath in order to admire a dreamlike "audience", that carries master works of Valentino, like for example the dress, that selected Jackie Kennedy for its wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes, that Monica Vitti in "La Notte" carried, or a coat Wool and leather that Farah Diba belonged to the emperor.
In this audience out of fashion dolls, name such as that of Sibilla radiate de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette Marit of Norway, pink Rio of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Say many of these customers, the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettably".
I yet perfectly can remember.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket out of the autumn/winter-collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift of it", says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I pull it all other because of its large love for the women and because it our beauty emphasizes, before", joins the former duke of Feria thereto.
I like to have the colors that it uses, very; it much light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and Meinungsführende in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d' Arenberg the first time cannot forget when she carried a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed to have therefrom, finally the age and the opportunity, to carry one its evening dresses...
End of the '90's came it then in the end in addition.
I bought myself my first Valentino dress for a festival in the lock of my cousin, the prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped upper part with a Dekolleté that makes its name honor.
"It was an aware become dream", says the widow of Rodrigo d' Arenberg.
"Valentino hangs not of the fashion off, its obsession is timeless", clarifies this Italian aristocrat, that lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D' Arenberg stores its evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress not only a dress is, but rather also the therewith connected memories".
The "king" of the fashion
The large finale of the display in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie Chantal Miller for its wedding with Pablo de Grecia in the year 1995.
Four months work and 25 "Ragazze" (like the fashion maker its vicinity groove named) were necessary in order to prepare this elfenbeinfarbene silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter of tail long.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the uppermost authority of the specialty press, this dress was a milestone in the skins Couture end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the uppermost company".
For years with the "savoir être" of the elite clouded, is Valentino now its best copy.

The most difficult occupation of the world: the human work bulls of Kawah Ijen
For four Euro, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano set its life and its health on the game if they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky ways.
There are work people, for whom its work is the hell, and others literal in the hell.
This is the case in Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers that earn itself its life, in that they get sulfur out of the volcano Kawah Ijen in the East of the Indonesian island java.
In addition it must climb down every day on the ground of its crater where the gas streaming out sulphurous out of the earth in the contact with the air hardens itself.
After it broke out here large sulfur stones, that can weigh altogether up to 70 kilos, it transports it in two bamboo baskets on its shoulders over the steep paths out of stone.
Only 250 meters are to be sure to the tip of the volcano, that rises into a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent in the turtle speed whereby they must retain the balance and carefully must set its steps so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost its life, how this happened to a French tourist, who crashed years ago at the steep cliff of the Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Euro cents for each kilo sulfur that they dismantle.
Above arrived, clear photograph and run itself it the way between the tourist, that it like circus apes with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scales, that a mine company set up a few further below on a height of 1850 meters
The company never is exploits PT Candi Ngrimbi, that since 1960 the occurrence in the volcano and (better said) its workers, whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupee (5 Euro cents) for each kilo sulfur.
That sells it then for 10,000 rupees apiece (83 Euro cents) at the petrochemical industry because this mineral in the everyday life is widespread and is used to the manufacture of matches, fireworks articles, cosmetic, dynamite and even to the lead of sugar.
"There we normally 70 kg carry, receive we for every ways approximately 46,000 rupee (3.8 Euro)", explains Anto, that in the normal case three stretches makes at the day, to us.
For each stretch, it required three hours according to what it is created totally, at the end of the day has it however then 138,000 rupees (11.5 Euro) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for one such exertion sheerly inhuman, is however the triple of that, what it would earn with the field work.
"The day wage of the mine workers here, where in the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euro) at the day paid become and the average monthly income two million rupees (167 Euro) amounts to, is very high", clarifies the carrier, that as a mason on the tourist island previously Bali worked.
There it earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 Euro) at the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with its family after Banyuwangi, a village in the vicinity, returned, and that for a reason, that is in Indonesia as important as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduisten, and I brought it after java in order to convert" it to Islam.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs are excited frequently and its eyes because of the poisonous gases.
The 27 year-old Anto has set for three years its life at the Kawah Ijen on the game, whose sulfur left behind in that it already the first traces, although it uncovers its face with a costume and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs are excited frequently and its eyes because of the poisonous gases out of the volcano.
This is the price that it must pay for the reaching of its dream.
"I become here yet two years work, because I a store open or Spanish or French learn would like", promises it in one more than an only acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but of life punished young man could work performs as a tourist leader, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he the work of a deceit donkey.
He divides himself a dirty wood cottage with other carriers and stands every morning at two o'clock up because the sulfur out streams also at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the darkness shines bluish.
The shadows demanding, climbs he in the light of a small forehead lamp at its helmet, that he bought himself of its own money, in the crater.
Approximately 400 carriers load themselves at the crater ground the baskets with sulfur on its shoulders.
In spite of its large profits, the mine company did not mechanize delivers the sulfur dismantling in order to save costs, and to the carriers, who work on own calculation and are paid after weight, no equipment at all.
They receive also no share in the 30,000 rupee (2.5 Euro) extra charge per camera, that the guards of this nature reserve demand together the amount with the entrance fee in of 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euro) of the tourists, who come for photographing the volcano and the human deceit donkeys.
"This work is not for the animals and for the person" protested Madrusin, a sturdy, 42 years of old carriers that three decades works since leaving of the school at the Kawah Ijen.
It is in a position to carry up to 110 kg and assures that it continues, "as long as it goes" because it needs the money for the upbringing of its three children in the age between 10 and 18 years.
I will not go in pension, I will die here because the volcano was my entire life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throats and the eyes itch, if the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers in the thick columns clamps, who climb out of the crater, the men are complains so hard, that no one about heavy illnesses... naturally except the usual breath problems, Arthrose, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, that shaped itself of the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on its back, Unainik with its 53 years nurmehr in a position is, to carry 50 kg.
It and its companions 15 break every day tons of sulfur out of the volcano, that are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bush to the warehouse in Tamansari in 18 kilometer distances.
"I will not go in pension, I will die here, was" explained because the volcanoes my entire life Unainik whereby it far opens its mouth, in which some teeth are missing.
Of its five children, the oldest with its 30 years works also as a sulfur carrier.
The time passes, but the arm bliss holds generation on generation in one of the hardest occupations of the world on: that of that that work as human load donkeys at the Kawah Ijen.

Singapore needs baby to the rescue of the economy
The Singapurer push the guilt that it no children have, onto the career, the stress and the costs of the real estate and the child upbringing.
"The population of Singapore must grow".
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: Let's fulfill our citizen duty and let's create life!
It appears incredulously that the verses part of an advertising are for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless - or just therefore - they became at the beginning this year in Singapore a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a Rapper song, the local saying such as for example "pushing becomes a" bao" (loaf) into the oven in order to make themselves over the low birth rate in Singapore amusingly.
The hope the advertise firm BBH that turned the video, preserves that the advertisement reaches on funny type and manner to make aware of the problem.
Your creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of the music in addition to bring the people in addition, fulfill its "national duty".
This is somewhat only for the Internet, therefore we must it amusingly and witty form.
It concerns the largest problem in this country.
In the reproducing, we are the worst of the world, therefore we noticed that it concerns a subject, around which we had to worry us.
We knew that the government had tried much, like for example the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of Speed-Dating-evening (fast flirt).
Possible, that many of these ideas were creative, it led however not compelling to the success.
Therefore we thought: Why shall we not make somewhat as creatively as possible in order to concern this problem, to compose like for example a Rap?
1.2 Children
He who not easily takes this subject, is the government of Singapore.
Each year issues it 1,300 U.S. dollars for political measures in order to encourage the citizens, to get more children.
A package of the government for married couple and parents grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends the motherhood vacation and distributes fiscal advantages.
But everything had previously little success.
Singapore is a rich, highly technological city state in the southeast of Asia that is well known also for the conservatism of its reigning and its strict social inspections.
In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is presently about 1.2 children per woman.
The last time when this rate - what also as a substitution rate well known is - was amounted to over 2 in the year 1976.
Therefore why get the Singapurer no longer children?
Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage politics and family politics of the national population authority, says that this is to be attributed to a "better education" and "larger career chances".
"This has the person enables, except to marry and a family to form substantially more option with regard to life goal to have and priorities to set", explains it.
These changes in the social facts contributed to the higher number at single and at the out hesitation of the marriage and births, whose result the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore is.
In the meantime an immigration politics, that aims on a drastic climb of the immigrations, led in order to work against the reduction of the population, to resentment at the local population.
In Singapore, there are blooms web pages, where the hardly concealed Xenophobie against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for that, that they hold the wages low and do not integrate itself.
The climb of the immigration is looked at also as one of the reasons that the party in power in Singapore obtained last year its worst choice result since the independence.
Since the choices, an attempt was undertaken to correct the problem with higher contributions and duties for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
During the falling birth rate the well known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the tax collections, that has health costs and the immigration politics, the example shows consequences also unexpected Singapore.
To reach the government tried that so many small dwellings are not constructed.
So it has already also effects on the housing market.
The authority for municipal development began therewith to control the number at small suite, that are as a "shoe boxes" well known and may be constructed in certain zones of the city.
These suites have a living space of 46 square meters and show a large sale success.
To be sure the worry exists that they can promote the lifestyle of the single, and that they deter the construction companies therefrom to construct large dwelling for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general director of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" can be sold very much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are around days and even weeks faster sold out as the larger housing units.
This leads in addition that they are better for our cash Flow very much.
It admits to be sure that the new standards give the developer clearer orientations, which previously hindrances were put into the way, if they wanted to construct too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to a climb of the national birth rate, to take is the conversations with the Singapurern, that work in the finance quarter, that they will have no large effect.
"The people are are postponed becomes" says strongly gestresst, the dwellings and also the upbringing expensive, why it by many a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me, it is says important to control" my own money and time another, approximately twenty years man old.
Men and women cite its career, that stress and the costs for the property and the upbringing as reasons for that that they can have no children.
Therefore the Singapurer have the last word if it goes therefore to got children - there can do the government yet so much.

On FB, I load beautiful pictures or pictures of games highly.
I banish myself also my time with acquaintance.

After that it clarifies a row of steps in order to configure a user account certainly.
In the difference to Jorge, this boy would become high load photos of acquaintance in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I would do yes, that if it is me disagreeable or I want to wipe it one.
"But I know, am" explained that these it to Cyberbullying.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with high diploma in upbringing and learning, means that around the children and youth to orient, understood will must that it is purpose of the social networks, to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a medium for the search for information; with the appearance of these sides have itself the game rule however changed", says it.
Porras clarifies that the academician Marc Prensky, proprietor of a master title in pedagogics formed at the university Yale and author of the work "digitally Natives of and immigrant" these concepts to the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital Natives are it, that children and youth, who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who should teach it, where we says he yet even yet learn".
It explains that it concerns a complex subject, "because we of them demand, that it a defined criterion about that have, what spreads, publishes or said will may, and this in an age, where the maturity for that not sufficiently is".
"You should also choosy be, if it them most importantly is, chosen to be, cable would send friends to have, without over the consequences to think", joins he thereto.
According to the expert, the most effective type and manner is, to teach the children and youth, what privacy is, to ask them questions, that it brings for meditation.
"You to say, it should it do not do, functions not", says it.
Porras names subsequently some possibilities: There are things that you would not tell a strange. Why do you make it then on the Internet?
Or: Would it be pleased you if one publishes a photo of you, how that that you published of a friend?
You know yourself the other publish over you?
Did you ask the other people previously around permission if you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Must everyone know, what you do in every moment?
A further point is to be given them to understand that they must act Online, how they do it Offline.
The same rules are.
"Someone outside of the Internet acts with respect, morals and other principles, and the same must for the social networks count", explains it.

In the past October, Peru was host of the III. Culminate South America - Arabic countries (ASPA), and also on this occasion was published in spite of emphatic request through the press the so-called explanation of Lima that one had announced previously, just as few.
On the official web page of the ASPA, one can convince himself that the document was published at the past Tuesday.

With the crisis in Europe may "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphing trains suppose, but rather in addition should serve, our production achievement to expand and our peoples a better future to show", joined Humala thereto.
"We concluded, a row of 31 emblematic projects the precedence to give, that the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas improve should. ..und therefore our countries unite and new economy forms open", said the Peruvian president in a misread explanation.
Under these projects, also five Peruvian, that would be would lie provide should on the breadth axes of its zone of the coast to Brazil, and from where two for a better connection with Ecuador although it gave no further details.

"South America must in the integration of the citizens learn", says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a joint country citizenry is a goal, whereby "South America can" learn actually something of Europe.
Correa, that participated on the 6th summit meeting of the presidents of the union South American nations (Unasur), that in Lima took place, explained the national television in Peru that the Europeans "in the second world war and in other discussions killed" themselves and are" "today practically a homeland.
In this sense defended it the project to create a South American country citizenry, that the member countries of the Unasur push.
"Reached will must the free traffic of the citizens and worker in all South American countries, like this already in the Andes partnership the case is it gives to be sure yet reactionary sectors, the one return into the past strive for", warned he.
The president Ecuadors advocated moreover the reorganisation of the organization of American countries (OEA) under the specification to diminish the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to consider that, that have signs the agreement of San José over human rights.
That that teach never promise to something, and in return in addition we sign the South Americans always all.
"It is incomprehensible, that the interamerikanische commission for human rights its seat in Washington has and of the United States financed becomes", declared it as an allusion on the political asylum, that granted Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that it would not regret this decision, because it had not betrayed therewith its principles, but rather would be come later its "deep democratic values and views over human rights".
It added that there had been at that time "established suppositions, that Assange delivered at a third country and its procedure would not become" kept.
It criticized moreover the Swedish justice that had demanded by it to subject it on its country zone because of an alleged sexual offense to an interrogation while "the Swedish jurisdiction permits this by means of a video conference, that over the message Ecuadors in London would have carried out will can".
Correa explained that the danger would exist, that the health and the psychic condition would be impaired by Assange.
"Since then he herself in our message finds, have I not with it spoken, the ambassador has me to be sure informs, that he an easy problem with the lungs has, but no serious", said the country chief Ecuadors.
The danger exists to be sure that it would take physical and psychic damage, because it would be caught in a narrow room and could carry out no physical practices in the free.
"That would become the health of every person impair", joined he thereto.
Correa indicated that the solution for the asylum, that was granted Assange for the month of June in the message Ecuadors in London, that would be granting of a license, wherewith it could travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juristic authorities Europe it. It unterstrich that it had given with London of conversations in order to find a solution for the locked in founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with the human rights, we do not turn this word for this case on, there had been to be sure permanent conversations.
"The solution for this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juristic authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a row of procedure on different European instances leads", explained he.
And "if Great Britain grants morning this license, this is settled" according to my opinion.
And if Sweden of Mr. Assange interrogated on the message Ecuadors in London or over Skype, how it allows the Swedish jurisdiction and was made in other cases, would be settled the problem.
Correa used the opportunity in order to be confirmed as a defender of the press freedom and said that that what he would not tolerate, "the mediocrity, that bad intention and the lie are, that the freedom of speech weaken".
"The largest enemies of the press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but rather bad journalists, that after profit strive and blackmail", said he.
In this sense congratulated he herself that Ecuador ahead did not take no longer "and also of the banks or hegemonic and spear middle class countries controlled becomes" of such journalists, and, that he will deepen "the revolution in a re-election in order to continue" the way into this correct direction.
Correa supported also the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least to its next choices whereby it argued, that the organisms became" "hard remain must and no opportunism and no as legal disguised country stroke grant may", because through it "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay destroyed.
The president Ecuadors considers moreover the wish of its Colombian opposite, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the international court of the Hagues, that divided before the maritime country highness of Nicaragua, to negotiate the lake legal boundaries between both countries with Nicaragua, to be "absolutely entitles".
Presently this judgment is not transferred.
It concerns a problem between one South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are unavoidable, they must be overcome however in the striving after a joint way.
They must be treated comprehensively so that one can overcome it and can view forwards.
Just as it trusted on a good conclusion of the disputes over the lake boundaries between Peru and Chile before the same court and meant that "it is correct for Latin America to call international instances if both countries promise to suppose the judgment even if it very hard precipitates".
With regard to the possibility that he stands as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to reach its third mandate in consequence, indicated he that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it also very heavily falls" sometimes.
Correa assured that, if it would lose the choices in February 2013, it out of the political life withdraw would become.
Power never interested me personally, but under so unjust circumstances such as in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can be corrected only by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief, that I it was, that this probable victory guaranteed, therefore must I this responsibility come later", said it.
If I should win, it would be retract me my last period as a president, after that I out of the public life.
This counts also if we lose.
"That is decided", explained it.
Correa made reference also to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I spoke just with the vice president about Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. It said that it had traveled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that expected would become, to me that it could travel after the choice campaign again to Cuba.
"It means in no case a relapse in the state of health of the president Chávez", commented on it.
The ecuadorianische head of state took today in Lima on the 6th summit meeting of the heads of state and heads of the government of nations (Unasur) South American the union part, that was concluded with the proclamation to a higher regional integration, in order to provide for a persistent progress, equivalence and security.

Cause for a dying because of Aids is today a too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when one it the test result confirmed: HIV positively.
"It was, as if a bomb hit", says it over the moment, in which it received the diagnosis "to reduce that the physician without recognizable success tried".
It hid it before its family.
He concluded to attend alone to its illness and began therewith to inform itself about that; and this with such use that he celebrated just its 43rd birthday.
He is came doubtless one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in that he after several fights 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the humane Immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years, what at the beginning the '90's was heavily conceivable, when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more stigmas.
At that time it itself avoided the director of a clinic of the IMSS to take leave, "because it into a dead end led".
At that time AIDS was synonymous for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
To be sure many people come yet always into the clinic, that know nothing of its illness and with which the virus already damage caused, and its immune system exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections are.
31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, i.e. after appearance of the first reported cases, "means the large success today, that the survival of a patient, that the treatment on time receives, and the survival of the general population exact same are", explained the leader of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, whereby he said, that this information had been supported in April this year of an esteemed scientific publication.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented on that the scientists have concluded since the year 2008, that AIDS would be to be sure no death sentence, that however the years of the survival would depend and the quality of life on the degree of the impairment of the immune system the people in start of the treatment, and that that larger chance would have, that are not drug-addicted: up to 30 years in a counting of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a counting Of 500 CD4.
Simply said, mean the above-mentioned executions that, who HIV positively receives at the age of 25 years the diagnosis, in this sense "problem-free 75 years old will can, as long as it under control stands", explained this expert.
In order correctly to be able to incorporate this progress, must be remembered on that that the life expectancy the mexican amounts to today on the average 76 years.
Even if the mortality in the past years significantly diminished has (in Mexico has itself the number of the people, that at AIDS die, of 6,678 cases per year 2007 on 4,862 in 2011 (year report of the ONUSIDA) diminished itself), is it nevertheless correct that since the appearance of the AIDS 60 of percent the patient grasped in the national database died.
Alone in Jalisco died are in 2011,255 people, and to the month of May of this year it already 187 deaths; to be sure is assured that there has been since 2005 universal access to the antiretroviralen medicines.
- Why do people die therefore yet always on that?
- Do not mean is according to opinion the problem the access to the treatment.
This is is my opinion, and so in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no provision problems in the medicines. The problem is that the people come in far advanced condition, because they do not know its infection condition, i.e. in very late phases of the illness.
It makes a striking statement: "Nine of ten patients come to us if they have already an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, are offered will must more premature diagnoses required, why, massively recognition tests" to all people with whom this is required.
The specialists and official of the Consejo Estatal agree this suggestion de Prevención del Sida e Jalisco (Coesida) (more nationally from shot to the AIDS avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio, that let carry out its test in a private laboratory, and this out of the single reason because it a friend of it had made, was that in spite of its young age already in the AIDS phase and had even the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancer-like tumor) What is one of the usual complication.
Everything is differently if you know, that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and would want do nothing hear.
"If I already die must, then rather three times burst", says one in my case.
The change was to that there improvement, I eat good, drive sport and would take the medicines.
Today his parents know only that it had cancer.
I live a normal life, like every other also.
"I work, would undertake much, would have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person", itemizes Fabrizio, that agreed to divide its intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to animate with its testimony that, that have today anxiety in the frame of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know, whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, should learn it how one can live like all people responsibly.
Its message is a summary of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condom behind the counter
Between the health programs and the simple citizen consist large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara, that took on the thing of the HIV.
And the most important is the prevention.
At the places certain in addition "became the distribution by condom actually increases; earlier became it individually delivered, now give it us packages with hundred pieces, what is already good, it gives however yet always people, that no access to a condom have", said he.
To the risk people for new infections, the youths count.
"Why do you need that"? is a common mockery question of social workers, orientation personnel in schools, employee in pharmacies and in the health system that youths not would like to stop itself, the correspondent assured.
It proposed to orient this inefficient distribution newly; the condoms should be not only behind the counter, but rather in edition devices in public toilets of arrangements, that are visited frequently by youth.
The promiscuity is not supposed to be promoted.
It is not supposed to be paid them the beer and motel how the governor Emilio González answered on the question, whether under its administration condoms would become distributed.
"Sexuality sees so not from; best is it, that condom that more closely to bring, the already one sexual activity exercise", brought it it on the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIVS).
The country lies nationally seen at 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and at 13th place with regard to HIV.
92% of the contagion cases take place via sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is appreciated that 50,000 people live with HIV, because it gives for every registered case 4 or 5 people, who do not know it.

After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a judgment, that does not acknowledge the restructuring of the obligations of the group Vitro, that was reached over a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ill-fated precedent is created for each national business with agencies in the neighboring country, that has payments problems.
One could say therefore that the procedures for the survival of the businesses that allow the Mexican laws have, in the country of the star and Stripes in the contradiction to international come off no validity.
In the practice, that leads issued at the 15th of June recognition of the judgment through the judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas in addition that the Mexican businesses of the seizure of its property helplessly are stopped on the far side of the river Bravo.
To be sure the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico door and gate in order to call inconsistencies because of threefold the uppermost court of the United States.
While the judge of the thing refers on that, that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit with seat in New Orleans says first of all that it concerns in the head procedure the trade bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international collaboration in procedure is not well known in insolvency of business with country spreading profile.
Actually the model law of the United Nations was created to this purpose for the unification of the international commercial law whereby that of American Law institutes was used as simpler.
Secondly the judgment determines that without the voices of the companies after recognition of the obligations in the bankruptcy mass, that had the branch of Vitro with its mother company, the required majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the obligations.
To be sure this possibility is acknowledged of the Mexican laws.
Actual Vitro is not the first case with which this scheme was allowed.
There is a half dozen of example, under that Agremex and Comercial Mexicana whose obligations were confirmed under business of the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (federal institute for trade bankruptcy).
Is correct moreover that after deduction of the voices of the branch the creditors of Vitro, who creditor, who in the courts of the United States against Vitro complained, i.e. the vultures funds such as for example Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and live pool Limited, no majority reached would have.
The voting would have gone out 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not considered of the court of appeal.
On the other hand there is Vitro guilt for its difficult situation from 2008 in the frame of the large economic crisis in the United States, that gave the country of blows.
For this reason the family González Sada inserts contradiction before the same court of appeal so that the voting follows, i.e. from all judges, in the plenum because only three voted therefrom.
Becomes not that granted, is inserted the Cerciorare objection, that demands the examination of the procedure by a higher instance, in this case by the colonel court of the United States.
The serious at this case is that the court let a document aside, that was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), wherein the procedure carried out by Vitro in the frame of the law is described over trade bankruptcy, and is referred wherein on that, that it strictly at that of both countries signed come off held had itself in order to to correspond to the chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
Moreover is referred on that, subjected has, i.e. the determined rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, itself that the country for the international trade, that guarantee the comparison of debtor and creditors, to the principles of the commission of the United Nations.
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.

These means were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de hotel (the professional hotel administration).

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The Weltenbummler of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected the basket sport more long than a 60 years and has the entire world bereist.
Few in Puerto Rico control the country such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes a so large intellectual collection of the story of the basketball.
Before it was tied by a stroke in 2008 to the wheelchair, Rexes was for 6 years part of this sport, would be it as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, authorized and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"My life long have I me in the basketball many hats mounted, even several simultaneously, when I president of the BSN, principal director of the national team and president of the association in the '90's was", remembered Reyes in a visit of Primera Hora with it at home in Bayamón where he lives with Isabel, its loyal wife since more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes does not exaggerate with these statements.
The walls of its house are decorated and attest almost all with photos and memories of its long career it.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are that, that remind one of its time in the Vaqueros of the middle of the '50's as a player until 1982, where he celebrated its 15-year-old anniversary as a with manager or manager of the club.
"Those were my best years, that I wetted at the most, because I part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 it would be be might as a manager, with manager or trainer.
Many fulfilling years were, including the five championship one after another of 1971 until 1975.
And then I took leave with a championship 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN.
From then, "Cuco" Ortiz, that received was a very good administrator", says Reyes.
I know yet that gene Bartow, that worked here as a trainer and was engaged at the university of Alabama (Birmingham), said me: "I have a very strong and 2 ms large player.
Would you like it"?
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that ever had Puerto Rico.
Bartow recommended after that the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse that let become established and was one of our best throwers.
I know yet how it said, that, if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for a further provide would become.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted it, but already out of a distance because it stood 1988 already at uppermost place of the association.
To this time, it preferred it to enjoy its execution and that of Mincy in the national team.
I know yet when we won for the first time in the before Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
After that the world championship 1990, with which we covered the fourth place, came, what actually bronze should have been, if this Canadian arbitrator had not been, who let repeat us the last playing style for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the world championship 1990 the best national team that you ever saw?
It belongs to the best how also that that won in the Olympic Games 2004 against the Dream team.
My favorite is however the team of the panamerikanischen games 1991 in Cuba where we won gold and offered a battle to the team of the USA how at that time, when they won against us in the world championship bronze.
At that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were again there, but rather also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, that brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, that 1990 was not able to be because of a knee injury there.
That a team, that was not perhaps with regard to personalities the best with which we won however a gold medal, and the joy large us prepared, was the before Olympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blocked players because of the incidents on the Panamerikanischen games in Mar del Plata, won we contrary to every prognosis the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers on plain of the international tournaments are impressively.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated on this plain so like Piculín.
And this without considering its course in the different leagues, in which it played.
Who was the best trainer out of Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a row of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys pleases me the work of Leo Arill good.
What do you believe is the best what you reached in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team of 1988 to 1995 that comprised the BSN at the beginning the '90's up to 17 teams in a season.
What remains to be done you yet?
There are things that I would have introduced, like for example the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce play for example only in its zone and encounter not until the national Playoffs on teams out of other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed educations and courses for trainer, table official and arbitrator.
On that I am proud.
What do you make today?
I hear gladly music, would see videos of music of my time in YouTube, would enjoy my grandchilds and occasionally I go to a basketball game.
And naturally I enjoy the company my wife Isabel that was always at my side.

Each semester if the religion professor concluded to hold off a course over the end of the world, knew he that he controlled an irresistible hinge hook: the end of the "long backwards counting" of the Maya calendar on the 21st of December, of which many people believed, that it would mean the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea, what should expect it in the following both months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, that some designated as a "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict under participation of Israel, that place, of which the Christian theorists believe, that the apocalypse begins.
"I did not notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester, that it ever gave" said Charmé this week the student at the university Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes, what happened today in the world, as if we would be removed thirty days therefrom, would be this an actual good period.
And it remembers that that is bad good for that with apocalyptic mentality.
And it is not the single professor that this semester offers, that should be actual the last in the story, courses over the "end of the world".
In Temple, the sitting in professor Barry Vacker gives the course "media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week the students examine apocalyptic subjects such as for example the atom war, Zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.
"We analyze, why itself these ideas gradually spread", said it, as well as the type and manner how hypothetical scenarios are offered, that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material arrives into the hands of terrorist, a war could break out for example.
The students analyzed this month films with apocalyptic contents and examined, compare to compare let itself how it in that the actual life.
"I have tries, the students about that to inform, what possible, is probable, plausible and impossible", said Vacker.
On the head campus of the university Pennsylvania the professor formed a team for Latin American story Matthew Restall and its colleague Amara Solari, a sitting in professor for art story and anthropology in order to offer a course with the simple label "the end of the world".
"We take 2012 not up, so that we always the option retain, the course newly hold off to can, for the case, that the world does not sink", said Restall.
In spite of the "impending downfall", the students must study, must generate projects and participate in final exam.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out at the eve of the apocalypse why the students have no other chance, when "to the night to continue work on, where the world nominally to end goes", said Restall.
The courses were chosen very.
"In two hours, there were said no more places" Restall over its course for students with high average, who filled himself with 35 students.
For weeks before beginning of the semester we received e-mails of students that asked, whether yet places would be free.
The students on their part assure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It fascinating is to be seen, what the people do, around itself to comfort", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for religion and sociology out of Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sparkling wine mentality or religion mentality is actually only a question of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student wants to declare Wekesa to be psychology and nursing to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never have I something of an instruction belongs, where this instructed becomes", gave it on.
I enjoy it.
But none of the questioned students - and fewer another professor - explained to believe in the last date of the 21st of December.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayas, and on certain type and manner discredit we it", said Julie Zeglen, student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and out of west Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it concerns only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
It notices in to be sure that in the western company an apocalyptic anxiety exists, that leads back several centuries, when the people on changes in its environment with the prediction of the end of the world reacted.
The Internet increased these speculations.
"Other place think the people not so", says he.
This is main in the english-speaking world the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor of the university La Salle, that this year instructs on the Philippines, answers quickly on the question whether he would know there a course over the "end of the world".
"The Philippines be involved not in the end of the world", wrote it as a hint on an exception of a higher instance.
We have a pardon of the pope.
Restall referred on that that over the years many days was spoken by the last court, and said that if on the 21st of December does nothing happen, "the people immediately at a new date think" or about the fact philosophized that the 21st of December would be the start of a seven year old period, according to what the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they would like to go to celebrations over "the end of the world".
"Perhaps call I a couple of friends on, so that we together laugh can", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
