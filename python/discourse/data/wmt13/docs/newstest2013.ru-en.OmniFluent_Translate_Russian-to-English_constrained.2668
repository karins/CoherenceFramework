The Republican strategy of resistance to the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policies need to combat fraud in elections.
But in the centre's final myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the United States more than the cases of death from stroke of lightning.
Ordzhonikidzevski, lawyers for the Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is for sure: this new trend will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense of such action partly discredited system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada American States are responsible for organizing the elections in the United States.
That is why most of the governments of the States with 2009 laws, complicating the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after elections in November of 2010, which brought the Republicans the 675 new locations in 26 states.
The result for 2011 alone was passed 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to produce Photo identification and proof of us citizenship.
Moreover, these laws reduce the period of early voting, undoes right registration of voters in the day will take away the right to vote and citizens, have a criminal record.
2006 elections no us state is not obliged to make voters Photo identification.
Indiana the first state, which introduced a similar request.
The us Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the 2008 law, passed in Indiana.
Republican authorities hastened to spread this practice and in other states.
In the last two years, they have laws requiring voters to show identification card with a photograph, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec American citizens have no such universal identification cards, such as health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people over the age of the voting age, does not have an identity card with a photograph, issued by the government of the state.
In addition, 5 million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document.
The cost of obtaining the required identification papers often exceed $ one hundred.
The new restrictions will disproportionately affect young, minority and low-income communities.
In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people, who earn less than $ 35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years does not have the required identification card with a photograph.
But that is not all.
Students - voters, which is believed to vote for Democratic candidates, in several states are not allowed to use the Photo identification issued by their educational institutions.
Zatos the same States allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs, who generally vote for Republicans, to be used for voting certificates issued by the clubs.
Until 2004, no state did not require proof of us citizenship for voting.
The first time such a requirement was imposed in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are us citizens.
These measures, apparently intended to limit the vote of Hispanics.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws banning the registration of voters on election day in eight states.
They also limited the rights of individuals or groups to help those who want to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped to make lists about 10 million citizens.
At the same time that the measures taken since 2009, led to a 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
The Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early, were African American, although the latter was only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of people who voted early.
Unlike White, who, by forming 76 percent, among voters who voted early at only 46%.
Of course, legislators - Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were governors Democrats.
The actions of the most controversial laws was suspended by the intervention of the President of the United States.
This allowed in part to limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of identity card with a photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules, which came into effect, of course, will hamper the implementation of the vote in the 2012 elections.
Criticism from Democrats condemneth bias laws, which was adopted, seeing in them a clear direction, not affect the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
Report by the Center's from 2011 shows that the us, in the case of these laws, represents 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: the new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense of such action partly discredited system of American democracy.

Screening for prostate cancer: to be tested or not?
In fact, the test rva gives sometimes erroneous results, negative, and sometimes positive, which leads to wasteful medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly rcnp examination, and there is good reason to doubt even more.
To be tested or not?
We ask two specialists.
a study in the United States, has seen numerous cases of infection among groups studied, so the findings are difficult to interpret and difficult to establish any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the European, found different levels of mortality in patients who underwent screening, and those who did not take place.
The study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the odds of metastasis 30-40% higher than those who had not passed screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass a test from 50 years, or since 40, when one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decisions, once the cancer was discovered.
Cancer can be as aggressive and semi-dormant.
The patient needs to explain the risk of a cancer, offering him a possible, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and given the choice, in these cases, in favor of an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men, who identified cancer, will not have to undergo treatment, since their cancers are not aggressive and not life-threatening.
We will be offering active surveillance, and if the disease will begin to progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly we define the criteria for making a decision about who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still to be tested.
But it is also important to check with your doctor to determine whether it is necessary or not to pass the test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created, to assess all the pros and cons to have a test for the dog.
The document (the English translation will be available in the near future) is available at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
To prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, observance of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if everyone had had enough and was moving, 30% Del raco have been averted.
"If nobody smoked, this figure would rise at least 50%," said Andre Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, the estimated 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remains utterly inexplicable.
For the Canadian Association of cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is a colossal harm human health.
"Even today in Quebec has 1500 thousand smokers," says spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting at risk from cancer is reduced by half.
Counterbalancet
The car, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
It increases the risk of breast cancer, thick and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime, and protects against Colon cancer," added to the association.
Food
Association also consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Avoid also increased.
In the meat by smoking, drying or, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," says the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been doing research on the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies can not be called a statement.
According to Scc, the study of vitamin E gives conflicting results.
If one of them showed reduced risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
The assessment of the impact on the development of cancer of the vitamin D is also no clarity.
But Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family history is important to discuss with your doctor.
"Braviaѕ the analysis does not lead to cancer."

Higgs boson in the details
Last summer's message that scientists may be able to find the Higgs boson, caused this boom - and not without reason.
It is thought that these Beauzon explains a lot of the particles in the universe, nothing so much.
Moreover, this is the last part, the existence of which predicted by the Standard Model is our best, or, in any case, "The least imperfect" description of nature and behavior of matter, but which have not been able to find an experienced by.
But still not entirely sure that he was talking about the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with really new particles and that she strongly resembles Higgs boson, predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, the new data presented this week at a major congress in Kyoto, it seems, this confirms, although to be sure, some of this is not enough.
Will present all the same, that we are talking about the Higgs boson, as a chance to do it seems minimal, and see what this means.
There is, in this world one law is inevitable, saying that the two things can not be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent this rule, there is no way they are not trying too hard, it would hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a strange world, it turns out, that there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of excluding Realencyclopädie, which suggests that the two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "Quantum state" is "Condition" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
The particle physics divided into two categories.
In one corner, we are good citizens, called, which was obey the principle Realencyclopädie.
In the other, fusses least, odious gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they may instead be water and the same place at the same time.
The site (incidentally, extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, the big fall, in turn, into two groups: mesons, who we will not speak, and "Particles of force," which extends the main forces of nature and to which in some ways appertaineth, the Higgs boson.
The very least, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creature, as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read the Chronicle, it is thanks to a staggeringly banal Beauzon: photon, or "Particle of light," which is "Courrière of" electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle, with electrical charge, accelerates or changing direction, it is "Disturbed" electromagnetic field in this particular place, the way a stone thrown down in a pond.
The "Violation" is born electromagnetic waves of (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the headline of "Carriers of force."
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference is that in order for these Beauzon appeared, should be "Broken" another field, Higgs field.
But the Higgs field far, far more stable electromagnetic fields; to initiate, to achieve very, very high energy, as if it was a frozen pond's surface, which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That is why we need a lot of particle accelerator, like those that are operated in Cern - large Hadron Collider, a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such an enormous energies.
The analogy with electromagnetic field also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and Mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, and there is no piece of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs, he will interact, wealth, while others (like a photon, by the way) it does not have.
So, what "Can do" all these studies, asked Ms Plamondon?
In science they are used to test whether the Standard Model (sm), and it also allows physicists to feel the divergence between the observations and predictions see.
Ordzhonikidzevski, some of them passionately wants such discrepancies are discovered, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for "New physics" and even some holes of the model.
The past, it must be said, still have significant drawbacks, without offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which form about 80% of the universe (oh - oh!).
But the Cern of such differences were not found.
Consequences
Benefit from these studies for the everyday life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories could even suggest, the Revolution will bring about their work.
They foresaw their application in science, but not much more.
In fact, already late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and who developed the first continuous laser (previous was a pulse) in 1962, said that initially the laser was regarded as a "Laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
And besides, the application can be found for tools, accompanying the study.
For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a sensor light.
The sensor, though it was not his original purpose, now serves as the "Eye" for all digital cameras in the world and won the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the large Hadron Collider will change our lives, but this only shows, in fact, that everything can be.

Palliative care is the best way to die... | "Debt"
The Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate about to resume, in the meantime, is preparing a bill.
Nevertheless in this critical area much remains to be done.
"Debt" tried to look out for.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Has lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, tore up his inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I gave five years, I have lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in the bed in the shelter of palliative care viktar - Gadbua in Beloeil, which came before.
"But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he said.
The disease is doing its job: the incredible weakness, which do not let yourself go to the bathroom and even to eat.
Sitting at the table, which is delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that he helped to feed.
He is facing us, even manages to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, made him the drugs, lead him in a bathtub.
Courage to death.
"My biggest wish that I am cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.
Few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"For the life of us teaches that a man must urinate standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the shelter of viktar - Gadbua.
To regress to the condition of the child - for some intolerable humiliation.
"Everything depends on the ability of rights" to come to terms with the decline, he says.
Because, according to many people in palliative care, an important event happens and in the midst of this crisis.
Patients who come in palliative shelter viktar - Gadbua, all ill cancer.
Projections giving them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more assistance, called "Therapeutic."
Ms. A., 89 years old, are most afraid to die "In consciousness from suffocation."
But the disease has made me start.
"I have got a good children," she added.
"I do not want to live," she said, before being allowed to put her mask to breathe.
She is still waiting for the final days of the recent visit of his son, who came from Italy.
In an orphanage viktar - Gadbua with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food.
This is palliative care, which is when that nothing can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11 700 inhabitants have a place in the field of palliative care.
This very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Bushos life goes on in the best conditions, which is possible, explains Dr. Christiane Martel is one of the doctors' shelter.
Whether comfortg physical, emotional or mental.
Dying we will agree to give mouth rinse of Brandy or Pepsi, watching that he will ask.
Diabetikov we do not make sugar levels.
And death are part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we brought beer Mr. H., who died today at night.
The morning of his son, swilled down a beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We are close, as well as patients," says Natalie Savart, director of nursing.
In an orphanage viktar - Gadbua no day is similar to the previous one.
Itbeside the 93-year-old man, who enjoy their last meeting with the family in the yard, Party on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically die young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and try everything to survive.
"In recent months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45" - looking says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients, taken in the orphanage viktar - Gadbua, arrives from home, and 47% of the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, to the care that is provided, to ease the suffering of the sick, who entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or at home.
And some institutions, such as shelter viktar - Gadbua and Society of palliative care at home to a large Montreal, specialises more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.
This large gap in the health care system of Quebec has led many experts to palliative care to fear the adoption of the law authorizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is a manifesto signed beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr Balfurom Mount and Dr bernhardt Lyapuant and showing their disagreement with such initiatives.
In the words of Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec doing enough to secure the right to palliative care of high quality before they will be allowed to move to euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I have seen the patient, who spent 14 days in the hospital for an ambulance, in terrible pain, and nobody took the necessary measures to facilitate.
I am afraid that patients want to die, only because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day of trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
The hope of survival Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist, I stop treatment, she said, sorry that I struggle, she said.
However, she told me that my days are numbered!
All-powerful care no
Dr Martel thinks that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank the medical staff, the way they did not fulfill their request, after the team in palliative care ease their pain.
It should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain.
Fujio she Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at home to a large Montreal, patients are not susceptible to anaesthesia in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps up to the moment of his death, or from time to time, or time.
Can no longer pretend that we do not know about the suffering.
More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to access palliative sedation.
The sick, in pain, there is always the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I wish that I had an euthanasia," which means "I want I became easier."
The creation of this report was made possible by the journalistic hrant from the Institute of studies of the health of Canada.

Large-scale real-estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, of the political parties and the Italian Mafia day after day tell what they know about the enormous "System," beset construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists Mafia.
"Industry," which it has cost the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how soon this system, after in the case all means, joking Zsák Dyusheno, MP and former chief of police of Montreal."
It is thanks to him in 2011 caused a scandal as a by-product of the investigation of official misconduct related to road construction contracts in Quebec, in which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest, agreed very reluctantly.
"Report Dyusheno" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only to the Department of Transportation would retain billion dollars in contracts," had kept their instincts to take part.
Uniiic Charbonneau "Has already shifted two mayors," he added, hoping that it will be possible "To uncover the scheme behind individuals."
Permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011.
The case became a 2011-standing anti-corruption unit, which included extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, employees of the special unit "Hammer," which since 2009 has made "Sewage cartel of" Montreal, to stop inflating the value of contracts.
In recent weeks have been carried out a series of searches, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard muster with - mayor of a small town, was charged with fraud and corruption.
On the list - Gilles Vaillancourt, the recently retired as mayor of Laval, the third largest cities of the province of Quebec.
His suspect in multiple receiving bribes for public contracts.
In addition, the indictment was charged with several engineers of Service of transport of Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito.
Last detonated the bomb, after an investigation of the "System" receiving government contracts.
Zambito for several years to 3% of the value of the contracts, signed in Montreal, a mediator, associated with the Mafia, which, in turn, sent money to the Mayor Geraldo Majella Tremblay "United Montreal."
In the 2000s Zambito money and he spent more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) various parts of the province, mostly liberals, who was then in power.
Moreover, he admitted that he was illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party natali Normando.
Sewer contracts, in which over-valued cost
In Montreal "System of" corruption has worked incredibly well.
Gilles Syurprenany, a former engineer in the civil construction, detailed described her to the Commission: in ten he received from construction firms of gifts, invitations to the trip, on the golf tournaments, in restaurants, on matches iihf and bribes for a total of $ 736,000 for sewer contracts, money which he over-valued.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that he took on his paw account for 30-40% with the help of false additions.
Then one organizer of the Party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay is that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of parallel budget, napolnyavshem partymembership cashier dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in deep crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MPs in Montreal, who in dismay.
Mayor of the District of Rivière de Preri on the island, she countered with 2010 sale of municipal area, bought for $ 5 million and sold for... 1600 thousand developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, it would "Pull the strings to further understand the functioning of the system, the swarming ants, to stop gangrene and identify those responsible."
The process she described as "Painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will establish its own investigative group and Observer, in order to avoid questionable practices.
As we go home.
Regularly.
Jacque Dyusheno notice for his part, that "Officials stole million dollars," but it is concerned about the role of the "Elected officials, who knew about the scheme," but not involved in the fraud.
Given that the proportion of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec is 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was merely a reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit to 100 dollars of donations, but, he said, it will not change the situation: "While we will not be strictly limit election spending, the policy will be dirty money."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing of parties: "We can not go below; a sure grasp of the matters, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and rule of law."
If this story and cast a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Dyusheno urge those who laughs, in its own backyard...

"Paris St Germain - not FC Barcelona!"
This season you in Paris St Germain gerritsen extraordinary scale.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual conscience, but it can - and a new dimension Paris St Germain.
Arrived great players.
Beside them I am growing every day.
Technical staff also kalmykiaa added.
These factors makes me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it is easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I do not get along.
From the beginning, in the centre of preparation in nif is acting as in Klerfonten' and before my arrival in Saint - Etienne I always walked forward.
Thus, you benefit from competition, the Carlo Ancelotti...
Replenish the years is not a novelty to play matches a very high level.
They also know that every training is very important.
As a result, the player, as I want to be on the level and to give the maximum penalty.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti support in my position.
It helps the deputies, as Claude Makélélé, who played in the position where I am.
Ancelotti - control of the market?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect the technical staff.
Today in the first league he has no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with upscale clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles Paris.
In January, I had a conversation with him were encouraging.
I was recovering from a series of injuries.
Trust, which I have also explains my achievement.
What do you think of the first part of the season Paris St Germain?
The first League Lyon took place in our country's leader.
But we are still at the ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have much to qualify for one of the 8th finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to be as widely as possible.
Now everything can be.
We will be able to have their say face to face with a very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the return match in one of the 8th finals.
Whether Paris St Germain to become a top European club in the short term?
He has already there are budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris is necessary to win titles and to consolidate positions in the long term.
Today it is not.
Financially from Paris St Germain have the means to make the project viable.
Not to take the title in the league, as last season, will be a failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we actually earnestly hope to win the world title.
Last season we were very close to it.
In may, it was a disappointment, because we were all, in order to reach the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Typically, 79 points suggest the Championship.
But other team, Montpellier, played more fantastic season.
This year, I think it would be all right.
Despite the fact that the fight for the title took such a strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much as we do and what players.
We are fully prepared.
On the other hand, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a bit frustrating.
We wonder, what in the first place people expect from us.
We will never be able to win every weekend to 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement a project of the game.
Team is formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League, that can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which is already two seasons, failing to take place in one of the 8th finals, although they have spent a lot of money!
Given the amount we were 15 points ahead in the winter break.
It would disregard for our opponents and to the French.
Lyon and Marseille, who was not at the height of last season, had "Awakened" this new Paris St Germain.
This shows how exciting first League.
I hope that in may we will be able to smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, we won.
Paris St Germain, it seems, from the exploits zlatan ibragimovich.
And that if they say that there is a "Zlatanozavisimost'."
It means that ibragimovich very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came to this and he proved that he is a huge star League.
Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he is a great player and star of a global scale.
We respected him as a person and as a player.
He also respect the people that surrounds it.
What he did, it is really only.
This stimulates and others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivate all to move forward.
As you have experienced Euro -2012 with France?
As a disappointment.
I ardently wanted to participate in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab some game time.
I saw there are many things, and I came back stronger.
Today I can play good qualifying matches.
This is what I hoped for from the moment of my baptism in blue.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave obraztsova.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deshama led Blue?
It is for him.
He has a good position to qualify for the group to the Championship.
He strict coach, he is close to the players and inspired to victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to compare.
Blanc has achieved its goal, he qualified us in the euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blue in Brazil.
a deserved draw out (1-1), October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
The match gave us confidence.
Eactual fought for all.
The shock in Spain, in my career there was no such matches.

The complete opposite of the Monetary Exchange, based on the central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties CЅ fees for processing.
Moreover, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, all, invented Satosha nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure exchange like Bittorrent, which allow the exchange of files between participants one level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites take a venue for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.
Course, reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June of 2011, five months later, fell to $ 2, before returning to today about $ ten (courses listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes the whaling as "The most successful virtual currency," "Competing with the dollar or the euro" and "Like a common currency."
Bitkoin different from other types of virtual currencies, as "Credit" used to promote the video game, which is made in the course of the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes to exchange).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the operation of canvi always in control and handle any central authority.
Bitkoyny in all parts of the network is both holders of the ledger, auditors, issuers divises, buyers and sellers.
As running the network?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new platezh user can choose another address, thereby ensuring anonymity.
Set of information relating to the deal, sign up for e-mail, with the use of encryption system with dual-key.
Network can also check the authenticity of the deal.
With the contents of the file, you can check that crammed in the deal, really exist in the public accounts book, which was distributed to the entire network.
Key stage is the registration of new transactions in this book.
It passes through mathematical problem, which was distributed to computers, decided that, like a temporary Central Bank, receives a privilege to add a new line.
It is about the phase of hash of the file, that is the transformation of a large file in a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "Take" new transaction and adds to her room, before "To be hashed using" all together.
The aim must be to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros in the beginning).
As soon as it is found, among other sites easily verify that it correctly.
Transaction thus are inextricable linked with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature.
If the purpose of deceiving users very quickly (less than ten minutes) were willing to pay twice one and the theme of money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signature.
Computer, determined challenge for 50.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly split in half, probably before the end of 2012.
Number in circulation therefore limited to 21 million, but it is one-millionth that leaves another reserveg...
The complexity of the task also increases with the computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites, providing the services of all, was attacked, and crammed the reserves.
"The defect does not concern the Protocol" - said Pierre NUAZ, which recently launched Paymium - company providing payments real money using the network has.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through that these anonymous Service.
But money also has the disadvantage.
Big players, such as Wikipedia, refuses to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as blogging platform Wordpress, their resolve.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Institute weitzmann in Israel, reviewed by the book and found that almost 80% does not exist in turnover.
"Giant sale" was announced in November.
"30 thousand dollars were exchanged," rejoice Jon holmquist, working in Coinabul, which is engaged in converting in gold.
Pierre NUAZ, another author of books on the currency, firmly believe in the potential of this technology as the operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (and money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but she uses the need to review the transaction, which thus are cheaper.
a better control their personal data and may thus be anonymous.
System is easy to implement for entrepreneurs, who do not need to install a new device or software.
Enough to give the address, which you can "To photograph and to recognize" the phone, says Pierre NUAZ not to worry, because he has already has thousand users.
There is a general trend of the revision of the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal.
"Before you will gain, will take some time, but 2013 will be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, incidentally, to reconsider various risks, which is now elevated, in the case of the success of this system.

We left Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops had left his area of responsibility in Afghanistan's Kapisa province (and Surob').
NATO and the Americans should follow in late 2014.
For the Afghan army, it is time to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only to us.
From us suffered mainly Afghan peasants, who are considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and disabled.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former commanders, hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants, who reject the presence of foreign armies, as it did with the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Their stand, they sometimes helps local insurgents, but they will no longer be, as soon as the West will behave more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from bases Nidzhrab, which I watched from the hills planted almond trees by French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles of the helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked.
Since the 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.
Circumstances have changed since the days of their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of a struggle between different groups.
Taking them under the control of the country at the time was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the obscurantism of the peasants, in which they surpassed Al - qaeda, but their situation has improved and these days.
The military commanders, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They had turned into traders, exciting state land to sell them under construction, with its returning from Iran and Pakistan, with huge American contract manufacturer.
They discredited; most of them, incidentally, even not at war.
People, as I have heard in rural areas, like the government, which consisted voller of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will leave those who have American largesse: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world in a time of exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantage.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul now has 5 million residents, one-5th of the total population.
Public schools in towns filled, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for the young people who do not want to go back or in obscurantism of the old parties, nor for the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represents the modern world, and is looking everywhere.
At the moment the army is.
Power, which will be her to command, will not be considered legitimate?
Staraya commanders, conducting anti-Soviet struggle, has already taken measures to restore the provincial militia, which would not obey central authority.
Afghanistan, mountainous country with a strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, in the manner of the Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, by Prime Minister, which has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections, scheduled for April of 2014.
But his country, since the 50s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
Industry has not been placed on their feet, no dam is not functioning, no irrigation system is repaired.
All are imported; nothing is done, except vegetables and fruits.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control over the infrastructure would be needed.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
It is only strengthened the impression that Western countries were there, only to allow them to take over.
Without power for the processing of iron ore and copper in place, without means of transport, to be exported through the mountains, there is a production.
The Chinese lindsayalmost left the field of Aynak copper months, leaving the international archaeologists (world Bank-funded) to dig into a Buddhist complex and to be the largest employers in the province.
, too, needs to be in one day equal attention from Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units in November 20.
The new agreement speaks to the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls, for boys, the faculty of the French language in the University of the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support of archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 in an effort "To win the hearts and minds" and to do the impossible task of zapadnoy assistance with offensive operations, services "Civil - military activities" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organizations, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, with intense involvement of local labor force, could help stem the revolt: irrigation, Wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, the protection of soil and increase the amount of arable land.
We will leave to the memory of their own, having spent 2 billion euros on military spending?
Far more modest budget had an improvement in the living conditions of the local population, very severe in the valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2000 metres above sea level.
Embassy received dozens of written requests for the implementation of the small agricultural works from the local communities in kapisa.
To get rid of uprisings, led by foreign groups, wants farmers, as they told me, you have to give them a small non-military support, which would be well controlled and came to them directly.

Heavy delivery of the Constitution of Egypt
It is a risky step of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily give him emergency powers, he decided to play vabank.
Surprising everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text of the following day.
Rivne a week ago, the head of state has provided a meeting of two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on preliminary text, which has been amended that weakens the institutional stability and lead to legal controversy.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
In the opinion of his opponents, the president determined to be "Autocratic end," continuing "To violate the word" and "To flout the law."
In the camp of his followers believe it is the way out of the institutional and political crisis, hastening the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
a very short period of time, which makes the brothers to abandon its intention to explain the Egyptians text, an article by article.
For president is also to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent raging across the country.
Mohamed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the US weekly time.
The call for a speedy vote like an ultimatum of the Egyptian people, "Or you vote for my text, or I leave his emergency powers," which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of the 85 Assembly members, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals have not responded to the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to make their own opinion.
Representatives of human rights activists, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
The necessary quorum was reached, 11, a spare participants, was hastily added yesterday morning.
Some very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that, in most cases, the article was imt voted unanimously.
Kommentatorov, incidentally, cheering the fact that one of the few differences of the day occurred around... Time for prayer, as some members of the committee decided that the hours of the Constituent Assembly was incorrectly configured.
The text, which yesterday was still voting, consists of 234 articles.
The object of attention, paragraph 2 remained identical articles from the 1971 Constitution, which said that "The principles of sharia is the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoping to replace the "Principles" on the "Rules" that would enable the stricter application.
For Islamists the fact that the article was not adopted, are evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," said liberals, who sees it as a public relations.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution is going through another article.
They point notably in Article 220, which will give Al - Azhar University advisory role, in particular, with regard to the adoption of Sharia laws.
According to an expert on Egypt's Sophie Pommiers, it is alarming, because "People, designed to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We are seeing the emergence of a theocracy ."
Many liberals, moreover, is alarmed the fact that the next President of the University, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current one.
" At the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With the Constitution, we remain within the framework of civil rights.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, is not ulamo, and people with a university education, some are trained in the French system, " Says Alexis BLYY, which is preparing a dissertation on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that " Around 220 may be ambiguity, as used in her term borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "Fiqh" [Islamic law, the Sarbanes - oxley].
And in the future may be, the question is whether the civilian judge competent to decide about that. "
In addition to their religious aspect, text, adopted yesterday, criticized because it gives broad powers of the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they greatly reduced compared with what was the old regime.
Other controversial moment: the powers of the Army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will be held not in Parliament, and the National Council of Defense.
Also will not be barred from the trial of civilians in military courts, despite the request of the association for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider bad for freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and is now banned assault, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for press freedom.
Moreover, none of the articles are no longer talking about the protection of women, emphasizes Kheba Morayefy, of human rights watch.
According to her, the only positive thing to ban torture in 36.
The word, which did not appear in previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak last night on television, protests planned earlier in the afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"Great and powerful" to Moscow will bring: migrants will save money for language
While lawmakers and human rights advocates argue that will give the law on compulsory language testing, the country has already emerged fraudsters peddling "Phony" certificates
Annually in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia are 13 million guest workers.
Most of the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families back home.
The law came into force on December 1, according to which each migrant worker would have to take the exam on the knowledge of the Russian language.
These rules apply only to those who intend to work in the service economy, housing, community and retail trade.
But over time, promises, in mbf tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Niv to take will have not only language, Noè Russian history, and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to acknowledge and to obtain, and for the extension of the work.
Exception is valid only for the citizens of those countries where Russian is the official language.
Not subject to the law and people, to obtain certificates and diplomas on education to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Favour, doomed and human
Network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language the Pushkin, University of friendship of peoples, MSU, Saint petersburg state University and other Russian universities.
To pass tests migrants will in all cities; now in Russia has opened more than 160 such centers.
Initiative on the introduction of testing supported and deputies of the Duma, and mbf.
But human rights activists, before the law went into effect, many times raised in the press question: what this is, in fact, will give?
That will change the obligation of knowledge of the language and for Russians, and for the newcomers?
First of all, said representatives of the migration services, in order to reduce the number of people suffering from "Trudovoye slavery."
Very many say about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of the delegation mbf of Russia in Tajikistan viktar Sebelev.
Protect their rights should begin until their departure.
Only system of organized set will allow 90% to solve the problem of foreign workers.
Problems are migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future of the migrant is bound to face unscrupulous people who under the guise of aid will focus is on putting him "Ticket" in a cramped Barak, where he and dozens of others like him will be months to languish without food and documents, giving 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise, and on arrival they are cheated out of a passport, not pay promised salary" - confirming chief of Labor migration icj of tadzhikistan Tolib sharipov.
a face, rapist!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, which intend to work in Russia, admits that not only did not know the language of the country seeking, but also on their own write with difficulty.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, how much trouble: few turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even sensible primary education.
Because their families can not even feed their children, not to mention the fact that got them to wear, may wear and by transferring to school.
Dorastaya to adolescence, the guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult, if poorly with knowledge of the language, they confess.
"Feel humiliated and challenged."
However, in respect of the law on language rights advocates said an important point.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
Status if not, there will be no exam, neither the official work.
Meanwhile, most gastarbieiter still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or no trespassing"
Many of the newcomers say that to get official status in this country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and the same language difficulties.
Moreover, legalizing money's worth from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be done quickly and just thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that we mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"Ask hundreds, two on cigarettes, tea,," said to reporters citizen tadzhikistan Aminov Umed Khushkadamov.
"Naletay, do not be stingy, buy painting"
The first day of entry into force of the law on language, it emerged that a fake is not only migrant documents for registration.
A "Phony" certificates to pass the language tests have already withdrawn staff mbf.
Fake paper printed on ordinary color printer.
Of course, they got new owners were not for free: each of migrants to death by brigands hoping thus to facilitate that the tests, paid 7 thousand rubles.
This in two-and-a-half times more than the procedure of the official test: it will cost a migrant laborer in 3 thousand.
That the main task for the near future is to protect the system of corruption, to "Crust" it was just to buy, converge and representatives of power, and human rights activists.
So far, authorities can promise guest workers, having failed to successfully testing the first time, time to study the basic language course.
Moreover, people who do not know English, will be offered work in the area, without active contact with people.

"As a luxury store"
The seller and buyer often find each other through the familiar.
I did on the sites, blogs, has not responded to a friend, who offered to come to the platform "A," where the person who will get me into a "Corner," where we will be traded.
The price of the barrel, I learned only there
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
To get the trunk I need a friend, who is out - seller - consultant. - I have a friend is in it, but I am not sure.
Sellers in the markets is, but that it would also need to have, figuratively, "From Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that a baby tooth out."
I am now even a couple of all got through, which I am sure.
He is their unique to me, because I know that I will not give up.
Novices looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tried to work as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid 1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.
Scheme, he said, has not changed.
He gave an album with Photos, where it was "Anything."
"I felt like a luxury store," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, nesiulykite Cow - all you can try.
I, a potential client, not just buy - we went with the seller in the Forest, it set a target.
"I was given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapons beat well, begins to trade" - describes procedure expert.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet on Web sites and in the "Last piece of," which offers to buy weapons "For different purposes."
It does not need any documents and personal meeting.
"Enough to have a certain amount of money," says in advertising cap on the "Buy combatitative Pistoleta or machine."
The people leave their bid and ask questions.
And minors will sell?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buying TT. Moscow" - to use up the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service are now spread over a vast network of front pages and wishing to buy combatitative weapons row a shovel.
People are as hungry fish on, then coal mine in Siberia
Military columnist and former military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of such schemes: usually site registered beyond the reach of the Russian laws.
People accept orders.
Buyer through cash pay.
"In response to send photos and regulations, which are hidden weapons," said a spokesman for the "Right to bear arms" dmitriy kislov.
Viktor Baranets argued that leaving a bid to the site, you can stay without weapons and to get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service are now spread over a vast network of front pages and wishing to buy combatitative weapons row a shovel.
"People are like a hungry fish on, and then extract insiberia coal," he says.
Makariv for $ 100
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to experts, is to meet in the amount of $ 100 to $ 900.
Arifoglu dmitrij kislov of the "Right to bear arms," Makarov pistol can be purchased for $ 100-300.
Will have to wait a month and a half.
He is from warehouse storing the leadership of the warehouses of middle managers.
According to official statistics agency, compared with January - October of 2011 the number of such crimes in Russia fell by 7% to 22,900, and the number of detected cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.

In the US strike workvidually fast food and supermarkets
Through the development of a cashier "Mcdonald's" go up to a quarter of all American teens
In recent days of America, a wave of protests against low wages in the department of the Corporation's Walmart and restaurants of the popular networks, the fast food such as "Mcdonald's," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Uendis" and "Kentucky are chicken."
No one is to predict, it will turn the tide in 9th, Vale or she is destined to become obsolete in the early stages.
Shares support unions and left a number of public organizations.
In raising the modest wage workers who receive a Walmart and a system of fast food, the aim of the protests is the creation of them trade unions.
Until this sector of the economy barely covered by union movement.
46 cents per year?
Shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America came an orgy of-sales, coupled with millions of people and sometimes with hardcover editions.
On this day, some employees of the Corporation's Walmart, in which around the world try 2.2 people, left their jobs and picketed together with unions and leftist activists of the company, whose products are for people with modest and middle-income countries.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores, on average, from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-wage workers Walmart come only on the job.
Accessibil and range of goods made a Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
, critics say, Walmart can afford to sell goods off in part because there is little pay their workers.
The latter also complained of the heavy conditions of work, for example, the shortage of trucks or handheld scanners.
The participants of the shares in "Black Friday" was to increase wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation, jumped from $ 30 to $ 100 a month.
The typical worker Walmart, receiving $ 9.5 per hour, these rashod not afford, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will boost salary to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the company $ 3.2.
It is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.
If Walmart will shift the growth of wages on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the store will be cost them only 46 cents more expensive.
a year they will have to spend some $ 12.39 more than now.
Supporters Walmart a note that the protest occurred just nine us corporations and did not cause any damage.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In its cash registers in "Black Friday" almost 100 of the transactions.
Representative of the Corporation's Dan Fogelman said in an interview with left-wing website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of "Less than five" employees Walmart, and that the protests were just "Another mainland's PR savvy stunt" who organized the Union.
"Free hand!"
Protests have continued this week in New York, where the object was not the department stores Walmart (their progressive gorod not complain about, and it is not), and "' ses" and other cheap restaurants.
Mcdonald's says he sells billions of servings, and after that he did not even give you a hospital and do not pay you for honest work!
Dzhumeyn Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
At the moment of the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $ 7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants eventually increasing it, but not much, and their average ordinary workers in New York City receives $ 8.90 per hour.
Less them in this expensive town not earn no one.
How to exist in New York for the money, for me, is incomprehensible.
Once through "' ses" was almost a quarter of American teenagers who job for their shelves after school, living with her parents.
Few people saw this as a major source of food or planned to stay there for long.
Now I am constantly highlights an interview with workvidually "Makdonaldsov," who complain that they have to live on the salary and sometimes even to feed on her children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal, a commentary, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have kids, if you do not know what you are going to feed.
The challengers, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday, the "Mcdonald's" on 40 Street and Madison Avenue, insisted that cashiers and cooks of a system of fast food began to pay at least $ 15 a hour, more than doubled their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that in the area of fast food was created by Labor Organization.
US law prohibits it to prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement harassed and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration has rarely makes their lives.
But to cover the Union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons.
One of the main - extraordinary turnover of staff.
Holdouts
Noisy protests took place in the day, and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of shares in the middle of the day rally in "Mcdonald's" near Times Square, where several local politicians Democrats, in particular, a member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams, who said: "Mcdonald's" says he sells billions of servings, and after that he did not even give you a hospital and do not pay you for honest work. "
Demonstrantov supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, candidate for Mayor Bill de Blasio, which said that "We must not to engage in support of the workers of fast food so that they have made a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every new."
As firaxis New York Times, it was the largest this kind in the history of American sphere of fast food.
But it had only a few people, though not all of them were workers fast to the public, which in New York employs thousand people.
It is unclear whether this will produce iskra Ardents of mass movement.

"While not fool the brain is obtained medium"
Popular among fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality lately taken to treat mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that the application for the patent podal and Microsoft.
But the conversation with the head of the group, an interactive 3 D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoftѕ Sharam Izadi is that scientists piercy points - time passed.
Their lures the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
- Tell, please, in broad terms, what do your research group?
- We are human interaction with machines, but has been trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as mankind in Mass was stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat-screen, sometimes poking a finger in them.
We want to look at 5-10 years and to predict radical changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and sensors kinect is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without kinect not be sold, for all the interesting sign management.
- What else we can look ahead?
- Despite the fact that kinect juliana interaction on a physical level, much still happening on the flat-screen, sometimes in 3 D.
The input information improved (system receives more data), and the conclusion is.
We are trying to change this work on a third dimensional systems for display on the basis of various technologies, including projective.
Need to release the computer world in our physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, we need to recognize not only the user, but the space around it.
Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a more convenient form.
First and foremost to hell with the stupid helmet of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice control?
Popular thing, but do not overestimate whether or not it?
- It certainly can not be called a panacea - question of Privacy, because it is not always want to be around them about their actions and intentions.
In fact all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in their niche.
For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not on a broad, and on such a stingy, short.
The gestures. She is not a camera, a device and wrist bracelet that monitors the movement of bones and muscles.
He is great, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But generally the future of mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice.
Is how?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You say and at the same time will tell.
- I usually just says.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to discern.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not at the moment of the car?
Is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think, in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more accurately determine people's reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a resolution on the depth, it is very important.
- If we talk about your work with sensors Xbox kinect, what you claim to modern cameras?
Do not have permission, depth or something?
- In principle the current generation is the thing, which can make a start in our work on the top recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at 1000 fps.
But it is not megapixels, and as the Matrix and depth.
With the last point of view all current technologies for us is not good enough - it adds work, the designers of algorithms.
So we need to remember not only about resolution on x and y axes, but Z.
Also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
The movement of people very dynamic, and the 30 K / with a clearly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmondskiy laboratory made the touch with adjustable delay the process - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) share.
Do not understand how this affects the interactions between man and machine.
I would be in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, but does not require its that frames per second was more.
- And the number of cameras to increase not need?
- Kinect now there are three "Camera," one of whom - infrared emitter, and the second receiver reflected signal.
But already the third camera - actually, this is a typical sensor of the visible spectrum.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially large number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate her, increasing the extent required calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog kinect, to play with the curvature of the location of cameras and to see how this will help in determining the top of the situation.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented the public for their points.
Not you think that, from the point of view of everyday use of the technology of augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time to walk with a smartphone in their hands, not very convenient, but that is what I think: the coolest would be a "Transition" augmented reality, when on the basis of cloud platform you could switch with glasses on a smartphone, head-up display and a lot of other locations.
Points - a personal device, in which the forces of the (private thing you see only), and simultaneously weakness - augmented reality on the basis of the glasses will allow you to work on a virtual objects with other people.
- Will submit it for a minute that manipulating virtual hologram objects in the air is not only Mr Starkey of "Iron man," but mere mortals.
There is one problem, which often indicates critics of the idea: no tactile feedback!
Hands do not feel anything!
What answers your group is preparing to the challenge?
- In his lectures I often say that augmented reality is the 7th breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think, 8th may well be adaptablements of tactile sensations.
So far, one of the interesting things - the use of second hand as a substrate for image.
It is recorded doubleckick!
But there is technology, which is aimed at giving these "Pictures in the air of" tactile feedback - interference for example, several focused ultrasound beams at a certain point where finger, gives a sense, but it is very weak - as if you blew over the ball.
The bracelets on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers are promising direction.
- And you have tried to deceive the brain?
To make him think he feels that the matter should feel at the moment when he see?
Colorise it is a good idea, we have not tried to do so.
There is another task, which is to beat long - how to make the man, physically located in very limited space, to believe that he is going to open, almost endless - work and the concepts of running tracks (it is not like in the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balloons.
While not fool the brain is obtained medium, the work is still very much for many years.
That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things in absolutely its infancy.

Models instead of culture - rosbalt. Ru
"Rosbalt" continue the project "Petropolitanus avangarde," dedicated to the citizens, who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
The top list got bright people's art scene. Petersburg, whose achievements beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing allrussian Fame.
The hero of "Rosbalt" - controversial artist kirill Miller.
The whole town apperceive kirill Miller - bearded man, dressed all in red, which meets the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashionable parties and Vernissage.
Picture of kirill Miller always a crowd of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of mehdiyev Petropolitanus social, philosophical fortune, the creators of the new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man Petropolitanus avangarde of the late 80s and early 90s.
Suranjan people of the city, their appearance on the streets of Ulybki the townspeople, driving up the mood.
He recently took the hands of the pirate radio and became Petropolitanus grinder, as ripe for this complex role all its bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
Kirill, and why are you still going to town is red, not in yellow and turquoise, for example?
- I chose Red as a fashion designer in Aberdeen, type and image.
In this world Red is a compromise between the artist, fashion designer and society.
The society is not that a little gray, causes aggression and excitement of bad property.
But my provocation aimed at making started talking.
The history of my provocative actions - an invitation to debate.
- And when you realized that there should be an artist?
- In an exhibition in DC nevskiy, where it was displayed my job.
I felt it my way.
Then volna staraya free unofficial artists and new, free, like I had not understood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with, which led to "Pushkinskiy -10" and the wave was not.
I get the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, but the word.
- And it is all in your art - clinic... I was important to go to the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg, where you will have to collect all the best creative force.
In 1995, I took over the territory on Pushkin -10, and there has not been repaired, there was a musical - artistic club, bohemian club's House, Petropolitanus s.
Many there were born: prefectures, tequila - jazz, remember the cord led to the project "Ukha van Gogh's."
Cord and his friends sang with plywood of lightweight songs, they were in a tight tights, among them was fashionable now the composer Igor vdovin.
When the band played live, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was leading many programs to - hahli Galichsky Times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career, and basic education and upbringing he we have got.
Gallery "137," the club of " Griboedov are echoes of art - clinic.
To our employees and manner of tortured left.
I hero of the century, when culture meant something.
In the 2000 poll was in the press, the award was "People of our city."
In the "Artist of the year" was named I ended my peak.
In a new era at the old rules, uncomfortable work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity is divided, you can be popular, but the not - so-cultural.
- Your work in recognizable fashion.
- Many of my picture is hits, they pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I will have software exhibition, "The Russian Museum in the clowns."
Clowns - timeless category.
I used social were now to be this is hurt and scared.
But in the clowns all brains splattered, the tragedy are off.
I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque idea.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian dressing a team order.
Now meet on clothes, guided by external mechanicsa, not the inner man.
And, maybe he can not throw away and Roger to spit it.
And deception will be removed with the help of dressing.
- And we recently saw you in the role of urban -. - cultural city should have such a hero.
It is not me, they should be.
- Maybe and commercial art can be beautiful?
- Commercial art should be nice, nice, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures.
Before people crowded flocks, bohemian single loved, the simplest of them other.
Now all crashed on complicity, it is hard to enjoy all.
I do not smile test everyone to like.
Now need to think, would be like.
Now every cult hero to 100 fans.
- And to Stas mikhailova comes to several thousand!
Has come soon, there is sex social work.
The cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 will not come, and ultimately less management, money, all languish.
I have fans, the main thing is they do not be fooled, do not want to spoil the family.
I wrote in my youth such a picture that one collector they are on the walls alongside Falk and larionov hung.
I started with the paintings, which usually ends.
Now often confusing.
Said: spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, rose by examples of artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty, from money for drawing of the paintings.
I am for this culture.
Kirill, what is lacking. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: an official from the culture.
But not all of them will be able to engage in the culture.
With the Kings all is not as it was, the Kings, maybe not quite understand the culture, but they understood that it can be a proper experts.
In Moscow now good consultants.
In our cathinburg people eat, which could be experts, but they are pushed, because we need a higher experts, which correctly evaluate these experts and will give them the road.
Now thrives.
The same Erarta, but their different than what they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists, which must find ourselves other museums.
- That for you - petersburg?
- Petersburg - this is not a cultural capital, in Moscow's culture is much more, where the soil is.
But on our kamny art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural soil, and we have now more than readers, it is wrong.
In Europe so many people curious. Who attend exhibitions, concerts.
But this layer thin.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.

Give birth in space
Zemlya in danger.
Global warming or a collision with an asteroid - killer.
Caravans of spacecraft with the Russians on board is off to find spare planet.
To save mankind, a key question, how to continue its kind in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact this planet only two, which can be developed at least hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars,," said senior researcher at the National Institute of astronomical P. K. Sternberg of (construction) vladimira Surdiny.
But if Mars conditions more livable, then on the surface of Venus - temperature of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... In space.
Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with Flora.
a half-century ago conducted experiments on plants.
four-generation raised on the orbit of the Peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - launch into orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies - fruit flies.
Into space in 1979 sent a couple of quails, to check how the developing embryo in conditions of weightlessness.
We get out is absolutely normal young bird.
But then the problem.
"The problem with the Chick must find a support, he needs to get back on its feet and to begin to move" explains, the head of the laboratory of the Institute for biomedical problems (IMBP) apatity volodymyr Sychev.
Not finding support, the eggs are not around.
And after 10 hours, a newborn was full of atrophy of instincts.
Chicks did not react to light and sound.
And where the trouble was that through them Nychthemeron they just died.
"And two times we hatched eggs, then refused, because there is simply impossible to work with them" concludes, the failure of the experiment with the eggs into space volodymyr Sychev.
With animals last biological "Mining" in an orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
But the satellite "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
Was an experiment with rats, which are sent into space since the fetus.
In principle, there is nothing supernatural.
"It is just been on the Biosatellite program, but, again, is a unique experiment, and such research should be conducted," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing from space rats appeared offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly into space until it gets.
an easy task.
Animals, losing, the usual habitat, simply can not implement its sexual instinct.
But, unlike animal, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has an abstract thinking, and able to create a proper emotional backdrop.
For ethical reasons such experiments are being carried out.
But the woman in space travel for 50 years.
The biggest risk had tereshkovoy.
The most precious thing, mankind, is a woman's body.
Our chaika flew, and no one on Earth could not say whether he will remain after the flight into space.
Can she give birth to a child after the flight.
"Because this is a question no one answered" says veteran rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June of 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan Nikolayev was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice attended in orbit and even himself in space, to a son.
But the risk remains.
We have very little unit has astronauts, who after a long flight managed, and grow up healthy generation.
"If more, it is dangerous even with the orbital flights" - says cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia's Valery Polyakov.
Yet, humanity needs to find some new path in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating an artificial gravity.
Neutral buoyancy laboratory cpc - compulsory stage of preparations for the flight.
Here in terms of nbl astronauts jankunas skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If adult water, albeit comfortable, but still alien environment, the baby - native element.
Small if confirmed - life on land out of the ocean.
There is a connection between what he is about 9 months from her mother to drown liquids, then it easier to get used to the water.
In principle this makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, only 2 weeks.
"It is very little, if anything, to forget," says instructor of the mine emanuela Marina aksenova.
Words, if born child weightlessness a more natural state, the need for women to gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness the abdomen, pelvis, its ability to push the fetus.
Significant, drop and this, relying on amphetaminetype generic activities.
It is, of course, in a special camera to go to childbirth, will push it.
"Then what?" - non-trivial matters Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child needs artificial gravity.
With no sense of gravity, the body is not a skeletal and muscular system.
Newborn into orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special exercise suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what it will be is vital.
"And this experiment, in which we will go with the birth of a baby in the alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring in the land of the disabled, completely disadvantaged people" - anticipated the Committee on Bioethics IMBP apatity ihor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
But, in time, it will be a reality, when Earthlings on the ship will go on a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space.

The main control and auditing management: Schwarz - verification system failed at the hands of politicians.
In the field of public procurement czechia have good control authorities and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, falling behind in its application.
This statement of myroslav of Calais, vice president of the control and audit office, to the site Aktuálně. Cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have the" said the current situation of Calais.
This report provides a joint inspection Czech and German authorities of control.
As an example of improper practices leads the approach of Petr Nečas to the so-called schwarza - system.
Recently, the Prime Minister said the group (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs check - out is banned or permitted?
"The law should be established any way, and if he is not allowed to do so, then the Prime Minister can not resist the work of the institutions, which are required to check and to seek fulfillment of obligations," - Calais.
The meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project between Czech and German sides, in which was compared the legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was it?
On a parallel investigation, which we started, perhaps, two years ago.
Simply put, it is evidence that the European legislation say, how should receive public procurement, followed by national legislation and then also applied in practice.
The information was collected and, even with another unfinished inspection, has found interesting differences - in short, the legislation we can be "Accurate and unmistakable" but in the use of it in certain parameters behind Germany.
From this is that it is not enough to create more and more updated rules, we need to focus on the application of the law.
But are viewed as the project can help you, that he does it mean to you?
Such joint control can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of the law, the reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economy means getting such things-to-low (but not always) price, to avoid enrichment and, perhaps, criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will reach, reducing restrictions of orders.
Perhaps this system will mug up "Securities" so that those who wish to find a loophole in the system, will find it much easier than it would have fallen.
You are talking about the internal problems of the practical application of legislation on public procurement.
But as a functioning system of control in Germany?
Is there such organizations as our petersburga (control and audit office) or this work otherwise?
As regards institutions, something in the quality of our petersburga is bundesrechnungshof by our principle, but there is also the panel, who works a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the authority is similar to a certain extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a unit of the audit and at the level of federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can manage only federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the level of federal audit houses.
As for local law, it is easier than us?
In fact, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be used as a model, but it is safe to say that it is better in all.
So, because they are better at dealing with control?
Definitely not, I repeat, a comparison does not like.
But I must say that even an exemplary country is faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not see any benefit from cooperation with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, as reflected in your institution of the amendments to the law on public procurement in some way be the consequences?
Given that the legal validity of the amendments relatively short, it has not been demonstrated in our work on the control.
As we pursue control in fact, there are some delays.
Take this into account only in the process of future inspections - we have started to use our new instrument "Risk of detection" through which we ran nearly 14,000 state contracts. We looked at. There is, of course, these changes will also be shown, because change restrictions, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
Is the approval of the law will benefit or additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
One possible problem, is that the rules "Will tighten" and can not be observed.
During the previous rules-controlled enterprises deep with the provider (for example, the regional operational programme - with regional Council) is that any violation of the law on public procurement is a violation of fiscal discipline.
Is in this case to tighten the law this way?
I think that is not the way.
System should exclude those who want to capture and to abuse, but not to punish those who commit a formal errors, leaving the decision.
This system will put more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let's recognize that this path will lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said the group will not disturb entrepreneurs checks so-called schwarza - system. What does this mean?
"Schwarz - system" banned or permitted?
The law needs to be defined by any way, and if he is not allowed to do so, then the Prime Minister can not resist the work, which has to be checked and to seek fulfillment of obligations.
We can say: "We will change the law and let it," but you can not say that will not pretend that nothing happens.
The law on public procurement rather, as it is formally be done, and it is the right thing to do. It will protect the public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offers disqualified because of a formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we are not enough.

Šimon Ornest': at concerts we want to develop positive energy
What do you think about that, less than a month should be the end of the world?
It is only one of many alarming news, on which we, the people, so easily fall.
By a group of the tap tap we constantly make fun of this and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to generate a positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give a unique three concert against the end of the world.
Could you to tell readers?
It is about a nationwide events to raise money, which we plan for as long as two years.
We decided to take effectivemarketing full potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which announced December 21 in 11:10.
The day before, while December 20 in 21:00 starts on three concert in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at a time when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific time zone, which is 12 hours earlier than we will be able to the calendar.
Who came upon the idea?
Initially it was my idea, we all came up with the artist Gonzoi Augusta.
Moreover, we want to build up enough positive energy and to prevent the end of the world, we also want with the public to think about the condition of the world, we will pass on to our children.
At the end of the calendar we have created a unique collection of objects of shoes, shirts, bags and original clues to the end of the light of these things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus also to support us.
The tap tap along with other musicians also sang against the end of the world, which is called the "End of the world is cancelled."
Will be a favorite listeners joitnscene Državna this concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end we will get there and the end of the world will not come.
He will find it at all shows simultaneously.
Anthems will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
Words to the song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the clip tomáš Ganac, participate in the performance also Xindl x...
As you have begun to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other people of the Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charity events and concerts.
Try to actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many like to work with us, it is interesting.
What will go revenues from touring the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational centre STUDEO, for 6th years we have been working with civic associations tap at the Institute of Jedliczka.
Teachers regularly attend school students of the Institute of Jedliczka and spend with them fun and interesting event.
The students themselves do not have the money to go to the teachers, and we try to give them the opportunity.
The project of additional construction of the Institute of Jedliczka in the future will be a building in which we move forward with this project.
At every concert will be several bands and performers.
What was the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that will attract all generations, including children.
For instance, in Prague will perform chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dana of Bart, the tap tap, Marjan Wu Bangguo and jiří Suchá.
Of all of the details can be found at the site www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such a "Great event" in the future?
In may will be the first to perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, will make an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would love to have held view in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we will be in the us, I would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
About the countries you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with expensive in terms of organization and logistics sobhank
It is not as scary as it seems.
We have five participants at an electric wheelchairs, their strollers must travel in the cargo area, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools.
However, has dealt with this without problems. Czech Airlines ČSA and British airline British Airways has always been great for us, that prepared me how often surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With trips abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled and so on.
With what you have seen to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than us, in Russia we have seen that in the East is still at a basic level.
In comparison to Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still a surprise move independently of the man in an electric wheelchair in the centre of town.
Also there in the course of such basic things, like to give way to the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there is a social organization, which tries to draw people's attention on the problems of people with disabilities.
In the contrary, we need to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of play is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that development and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid is normal that people with severe disabilities move on the streets, you can use the toilet, in the museum, but anywhere...
There is very common that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, in which we have them with the tap tap a little bit ahead!
Respect of the public or neglect is one thing, but at the moment, when we will be well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then all really start to change.
As long as this one-time - people strong-willed.
The tap tap currently very popular, but will return to two years ago, that in 1998 you made her to organize?
I entered the Institute of Jedliczka as a teacher, I had many young people who wanted something to do.
And because I am a musician and plays including the saxophone, then, together with colleagues wasog interesting musical circle.
Well, and over time, as our leading Ladya Angelovič, it is a bit out of control (laughs).
Popularity as it is only in recent years, and I have confused?
It is true, it helped that we began to join the famous singers and to work actively to the group.
We have concluded that the work, which no one can estimate, essentially as if they did not exist.
By means of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
Were there before you order is so good to get the tap tap?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things, Express one another.
It is logical, all new be taken with caution, and lasts that long.
There are very few rare of things, but I would dare to say that tap tap one of them.
First impression of the person that we see, of course, sorry, it is obviously...
But the pity is over, because people with disabilities are not suffering from any and all the personalities, which we must spare.
They are people who can live a normal life and to develop, of course, only on condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities something happens, it is not just for them, but for the whole society.
Have the success that you are a strict head, what you would think?
If we want to do the job well, we should be uncompromising on a lot of things and keep a certain discipline.
But I believe that it is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and in, and when he hears that twice a week they had to go to rehearsal, to attend the preparatory courses and to spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it is so in any group that want to work and to accomplish something.
Currently in the group-the tap tap twenty.
As early as 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovič.
We open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and strength of will, our door is always open.
He will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Stadium Incheba, in Brno - club Fléda and Ostrava - in centre Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
The end of the concert, all three city connect via at the time of the execution of the tracks at the tap tap "End of the world is cancelled."
This project is designed to raise funds in the amount of $ 25 million for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free facilities for educational centre STUDEO at the Institute of Jedliczka in Prague.
Ticket to the concert is worth 400 kroner, for children under 12 free entrance. Tickets can be bought in advance in Bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European space agency Poland was adopted by the member of the European space agency as a second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of Esa September 12, 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with Esa in 1994 and in the years that followed, the actively participated in a number of projects of the agency.
But the path to kosmos Poland began much earlier.
Before World War II Polish enthusiasts have been doing to space, but it is not always met with understanding.
Recall, for example, to lecture a. Ary Abramovich Sternfeld, of which December 6, 1933 was in Warsaw astronomical Observatory of the idea of his pioneering work "Introduction to space."
The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Ary Abramovich Sternfeld recalled that only Dr ján Kostka Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France, Ary Abramovich Sternfeld won the award of Robert Hesnault - Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsi for "Introduction to space."
Dr ján Kostka Gadomski (1899 - 1966) mentioned above, later became a great proponent of astronomy and space.
He published in the Polish magazines of hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on the scientific disciplines.
Kostka Gadomski became well-known proponent of space exploration, and his contribution was assessed including that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
In 1925, Poland was built railway an inspection, equipped with rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea is still unknown, as well as details of the project.
It is not clear even to crack down or to brake of the truck was to be used by a missile.
Information about the draisine known only from the newspapers of the era.
With 1933 Polish artillery began to wonder about the missile missiles.
Studies carried out section of the techniques bezboyaznenny in cooperation with professors mieczysław Volfka and gustave Mokzhitskiy.
Of the materials research shows that reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops of the work was interrupted.
In 1937 in specialized printing the idea of photovoltaic gbis fighter, which offered an engineer rogozin's atlantist, and next year the work "Air missile - torpedo and aircraft missiles and bombs" author Lelivy - Kzhivoblotskiy.
The project was developed for military use of the rocket engines.
Before the war all projects for military use of missile technology to the study of temporary scientific advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), who coordinated the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operations work ended because of the war began.
The scientific work, devoted to space, appeared in the Polish Press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (weithed towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first time the company is mentioned in november n 1954 magazine of "Problem," which publishes four an article on Astronautics.
In one professor mthere Subotovich offered to organize society, which will occupy the space.
At the time, had already gathered pace projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956 Polish Society of Astronautics (Poá) tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and it is autumn Poá became a full member.
And the following year the first chairman Poá of Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this role he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
With 1956 Poá made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful sounding rocket rm (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, the latter scientific research.
The first type rm -1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
Missiles able to overcome a distance of 1800 meters, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was 5 pounds.
Was subsequently built an improved version of rm -1 a, and in the summer of 1959 Bledovskiy compound was carried out on the two-stage rocket rm -2.
The rocket was a length of about 1.4 meters, and her weight of about 11.5 pounds.
The next version of the rocket was able to do this research - missile rm -34 to overcome 14.5 km, and her job was overseeing the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
Of the first missiles rm a rocket meteor -1, between 1962 and 1965.
Missiles were conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 inches, and initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Developed type three (designated as a meteor -1 a, -1 B and -1 C), which was organised the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
Missiles meteor -1 and had space with the 0.4 L, a -1 - 0.34 L, and a -1 - 0.62 L.
Maximum range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute was the development of a missile with a meteor -2, and its first flight tests began in October of 1970.
Missiles meteor -2 from the weight of 380 kg was able to lead the payload weight 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Then built a version of the -2 and a -3.
It should also mention the accession of Poland in cospar (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a National Committee cospar two years later.
Moreover, within the framework of the Interkosmos, Poland has participated in studies of space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot mirosław Hermaszewski became the second space after vladimira vladimír Remek.

The abolition of the law on public works - it is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
Statutum caused heated discussions in society.
Sure, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal - oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that a separate business unit, national economic system, is in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, unfettered flow of private capital along with rampant financial speculation.
As a result of the significant differences in the cost of labor (wage) price tension.
The thing you need to understand the situation, when the manufacturer through the delivery of cheap goods are trying to survive in the economic competition is what "Is" the cost of a competitor with a view to take a larger share of the market, and thus increase their own income.
On a massive scale, this means for the majority of entrepreneurs or shifting production abroad, or low-cost purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result, the rise in unemployment in the countries where labor costs, compared with other, high.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, including for them is rising unemployment, the inevitable government spending on social needs.
The overall situation amplified by the unwillingness of the gentlemen of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the social economic and social damage to them in the pursuit of profit.
Situation is so well known that need no specific statistics.
_'s cavalier methods of private capital will at the level of individual states, when governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the aim of attracting foreign capital.
In other words, the government gives its own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected in the first place in the change of the current legislation.
The goal is cost to make his people to submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serve as a tool to cut workers' rights in the field of labor laws.
As a result of a higher level of poverty, but also to the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years there are public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves own work.
The number of these people are already approaching million.
As part of the efforts to increase the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly cases where self-employed people receive a salary that the state, they should receive extra money that they received the cost of living.
This scandal became known to the public and in case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU states, undoubtedly, leads to the same condition, in which people, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the social status, are required to emigrate, as it did in the 19 century, or to live in poverty-level wages to the margins of society in the hope that someday in the country is going to come from private investment capital.
But the question is, where he will take?
If capital comes from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, an Egyptian, an African still works for the share of wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to nausea claim that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital has insisted that the state has managing action to intervene in the economy.
The question to be answered is whether varmland private capital, is now practically management policy and the whole state, in their own selfish goals?
Unambiguous answer is yes.
The evidence is there almost omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, revealed in corruption, benefits in the legislation, where virtually all deserve punishment, but it is not a crime.
Of the situation is that the state Department of a lack of financial resources to the development of the bills private law firms, which are closely linked to the industry.
Then these bills argue the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western-type, but from financial - powerful groups who own interests.
Obviously, the Liberal - oriented democracy now quickly find themselves in such a situation, as described Appianom in the works "Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompéia": " The state has long been broken up, and the agency have violence.
Bribes, illegal receipt of handouts with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the polls with pre-sold golos ..." Decent people never ran for office of the ruler, and, in the end, once the state for eight months, without consul..." "Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is an autocracy and the necessity of finding an energetic man..." Appian Pompéia thought it would be, but they became Caesar, who had replaced democracy to autocracy.
As in antiquity, in modern society dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital has at its core is not intended for use in public order.
The result is not different from the past: unprecedented decline of the elite without any efforts to reform deeper.
The cause of a fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19 and 20 centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of the type of liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which is expected next round.
Especially tragic is that the current elite completely ignored consequences in the thousand victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe, which we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The abolition of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus this trend are systemic.
The decision is the target of political and social reforms, which would strengthen the equity of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in favour of the state.

Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"Of violence will not do, and can never be released" - sting, the song "Fragile," where the main verse of the refrain is a word: "Do not forget that we fragile."
"If my sons are not like wars, they would not be" a dying goutelle Shnaper, wife meer Amshel Rothschild.
The recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, caused a lot of feedback.
One advocate for Israel, arguing his position, that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians in the terrorists' other supports the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who in the periodic waves of murders - offender, and who the victim in the end, the current citizens of Israel, including self-governing territory, was born at the time of the current political situation, and have not witnessed violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to take a look at who primarily serve has lasted 95 years of tension (from the signing of the Balfour declaration in November of 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is based on historical facts, some of them out on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of events in modern history.
The history of humanity - is the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same alexandru velikiy or Napoleon.
What is less clear is whether these people are completely independently made their steps, or for their throne was someone who sent their actions to advance its goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and their power could not take place for a generation.
Among from astronomically wealthy families are allocated one that could be seen as head of the octopus (do not know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - rothschilds.
Many of them do not write.
Of course.
First News agency (reuters) they bought already in the 90 years of the 19 century, to stop rumors linking their behalf with criminal action in high places, in the shadow of who they were, and which has always led to a strengthening of their power, accumulating wealth or both, in the way of another.
They are large blocks of shares in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries, whose central banks they do not have a stake, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq has 5 members, after the overthrow Qaddafi stayed only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the Central Bank of their country into their own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the central bank for Rotshildovskiy Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luiz McFadden was poisoned in 1936, after suffering like Sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst of world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of the plan three world wars created great a 33-level albertus solderings.
The task of the first war was the collapse of the monarchy in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial rule, especially Britain, and one should lead to a reduction of the world's population, approximately 0,5-1 people of (the number of slaves will be enough to provide for them comfort and luxury, and they will not use), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be other than as a prerequisite for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power.
Method by which a working group of the richest families headed rothchilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the supply of (order AB Chao - order out of chaos).
But this decision is a fake and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (cf. The Fed, which was intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis, resulting in 1907).
Thus, after they have been able to unleash wwi by the murder of the Habsburg heir of the Austro - Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia, by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, unreasonable in military and economic relations the surrender of Germany (already there was no need of the war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia), and, as a result, there has been carving up Central European country, Austria - Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany's huge war reparations, which set the stage for radicalization of the impoverished masses, then went on to throw the Germans quite strong, convicting perpetrators and offering a simple solution to the leader, then to create a multinational czeckoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to be, and indeed played a role in the 5th column, sparking the fire of war.
In the late 19 century, the Rothschild family has provoked the basis of the Zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the region's historical judaea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration, the conditions for mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to happen first encounter with local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The outbreak of World War II, it is difficult to assess, escaped whether Hitler from chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or what he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps, the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state, the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was caused by war reparations for the 2 world War II, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a third source of the war.
If international bankers will be able to start, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos, not only within the country, but also internationally (to take just a sharp division of people to supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is a victim of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict, where the offense breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
It is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because like us, international bankers confronts people to vote in the elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist loyal international bankers policy, making all, to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to turn into a global conflict, and given control of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the world are now being words, by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a crisis, and people will accept the new world order."
The new world order in their vision is a world of the Lord and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy, coveted comfort.
World where every baby body was born with the implant chip, with which he is being under total control.
" And makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on his right hand or forehead on stigma, so that the man, who has not been marked with the name of the Beast, or the number of his name, could not buy or sell.
This wisdom: everyone with reason, can calculate the number of the Beast.
For consistent with it the name of human, and the number is six hundred sixty six.

Film "Operation" Argo ": the worse nowhere, is Hollywood
In November of 1979, a crowd of Islamist student demonstrators seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 diplomat.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza shrine Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the us, which was a patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration the situation was not expected - she could not afford to throw shakh overboard, because it is fundamentally could undermine the confidence of the allies in other countries.
But to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the Revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not in the state.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was strengthened by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after talks brokered by the government of Algeria.
Their fate was summoned home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Defeat in Iran to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, repressed actor Ben Affleck "Operation" Argo " Describes one of the episodes of the story, which brought America's small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape.
After serious troubles, they finished their way into the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities have managed to take them from Iran, with the help of the extravagant legend of the cover, according to which they rode on Canadian passports as members of the crew, in the country place for filming sci - fi epic.
The combination of genres
Plan, which invented an expert on "Evacuating" Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To legend was true, in specialized magazines are writing about a film project, was a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation has long been kept secret by the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
The film Affleck is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "Movie - movie Opus," the story of a good idea, a scam - example could be a number of films about Ocean's.
The film is constantly changing mood - on the one hand, documented of scenes from Tehran (the credits to show significant historical photographs of events, and the way the situation was demonstrated in the film - a big differences in this not).
On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood mosimage, overlapping with irony and mild exaggeration.
a scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discussed the situation in the table of negotiations, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleck admirationful have managed to do was restarted his career.
Of being an actor became a respected director, and his game to be an object of ridicule.
"Operation" Argo "His third feature film, after dark detective" gone baby gone " (2007) and the thriller" the City " (2010).
At the same time it is the first film Affleck, who has not played in the hometown of the director - Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of place in this case refers to the qualities that towered earlier films of director on a Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is evident in "Argo," where Tehran "Play" Canada.
The best scene in the film is happening on the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the Embassy impressive its clarity, who also conveys emotions of confusion and unpredictable, which occurs when it suddenly change history.
a similar effect Affleck and his colleagues achieved in scenes fictional (fake headquarters in Tehran Bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
Director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not suggest a lot of exciting scenes of cinematic values.
He is been working with this much, sometimes something further elaborated - where it all comes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call to America to prevent the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and Pahonia the runway looks pretty fetched).
Lack "Argo" is a distraction, related to the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters deserved a large space, and they are in the movie is not the only one.
The film Affleck lacks a bit dramatic, this film, which you can watch with moderate interest, evaluating performances and retro - style thriller set in the Seventies.
But capture with difficulty.
However, that is enough for a reminder of one, still in a sense of living history, as well as evidence of how exaggerated view of an omnipotent and omniscient intelligence agencies.

Rules some of the balloons, bananas and circus
Eures www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who each year survey of the most absurd banking fees, now decided to announce a competition for "The most absurd or project of the studio the EU."
"We have led to the recent events, in which the EU plans to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of the major European companies," said "Right" organizer of the questionnaire patriek Nager.
Among already voted on the nomination of - the recent decision of the European Court of consolidation in the insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, the women have benefits for life insurance, because insurance companies are objectively are less at risk.
" Further incredible idea of masterful EU people can bring to the contest until the end of this year.
The vote will take place before the end of February of 2013, " Said Nager.
The controversial orders the EU, for example, and mandatory addition of components in the fuel that, as a result of damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury only because they contain a relatively small number of dangerous substances, or directive on the size of the cages for hens, which this year has risen substantially eggs.
The criticism has been a de facto ban on the use of the term "Becel oil" or from the sale of the classic light bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in length.
European phone often made the decision under pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defend any state or group of states (thus czechia now even under threat, veterinary use to defend the demands of its banks).
Interests lobby is, for example, bananas, the highest-quality European Union should have been up to 14 cm long and did not dare to be "Abnormal curvature."
The European Commission dodged the question that only harmonise existing disparate national rules that affect trade.
The EU, despite resistance from some countries, yet softened standards on fruits and vegetables, on the grounds that the existing directive will lead to vast waste products.
Candidate for the poll may become and last year's resolution of the EU, which sold balloons have to come with warning that children under eight years could not finagle their unattended adults.
The EU turned to American studies in which the balloons in the game is a potential cause of death of children by suffocation.
Such restrictions now is for children up to 14 years, which is forbidden to go to fairs.
Funny ideas are born and at home.
Quite absurd is and regulations concerning the European officials: anyone who has the EU any official position, can not, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and should instead says "FYROM" (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Eures Bankovní poplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "Principle of non-interference" (laissez faire), offered to vote, apart from a few above the absurd rules, for example, EU rules on the amount of food supplies to the territory of a member state.
The EU set a maximum volume of food stocks, which may be located in the Czech Republic on the day of its membership in the European Union.
Subsequently czechia exceeded, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she was threatened by a large fine.
Organizatorov the questionnaire also interested in the idea to pay some countries for the fact that they have no idea of the Sea, and to provide subsidies for the application for a subsidy.
But the idea arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
" We are at a disadvantage, because we do not have sea.
Ask the European Union for compensation ," said the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture yaroslav Palace (cssd).
The argument he pointed out that the country was a good grain harvest, and as a result, the so-called interventional procurement state had a full warehouses of stocks, which was necessary to move.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, we were supposed to pay million euros.
In the end, the European Commission agreed to the Czech Republic through a tender to supply of grain from countries that are landlocked.
Subsidies to obtain the subsidies offered to present the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Pavel Nemec (us-Deu), in particular, the subsidies would go to the drafting of the statement on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU is freakish orders excluding
Although Statutum in member states are easily drawn criticism, EU efforts to regulate, as well as more effective functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserves more recognition.
a serious problem, according to experts, is of EU subsidies to projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
Arouses emotions among Czechs and the fact that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
While the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians kept the name "Olomoucké syrečky," but "Tuzemskiy Roma," a tradition which in our country has its roots in the 19 century, our producers should rename the "Tuzemak."
To be called Roma can only products made from cane, not from sugar beets.
The official list of the products of the EU, along with world-famous cheeses of "Feta" and "Gorgonzola," marzipan from German Ljubek or Parma Ham, who have already been, for example, karlovy breadcrumbs, police and Karp and Saaz hops.
The trademark of the EU can be proud of Pardubice carrots and mining romanticism tube.

People want I watched Republic, but I am a fan, says Okamura.
Ottmar senator, as a man comes to mind to run for president?
I do not think that the risk becoming a senator or president.
If we in the country all functioned without problems, but I still would not be running.
But I can not see how, in the last 20 years, the country is being stolen, as there tend to thieves, people raise taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when you see something that I do not like, you are trying to find a solution, as it is to change.
And since I was forty years old and I am an independent person, not related to any party, I do not have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for the election of a senator or president.
In the Senate did you get, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Not turn are you so back to the people who you choose?
I always said that I will get involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the vote in the Senate.
I later said that if will be chosen Senator, I would not run for president.
My goal is not the position, the position is a means by which I can make their views.
So I have the greatest influence and wide powers.
But the difficulty is not so much that we, as a nation, grumbling in the bar or watching TV, but ready to trample on anyone who will try to change something.
The media, which people tarnish, and which confuse freedom of speech, freedom of lies.
For example, about me saying that I am giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to jiří of Paroubek.
Will go to your views.
The fight for the presidential castle you started with a thesis about the physical and criminal responsibility of politicians and otherwise property declarations on the amount above 20 million.
To do, we need to change the law.
You as president of the authority, and only a Senate may propose laws.
As you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied for ensuring that all excursions became free enterprise, it managed to advance.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a proposal to the left or right, he deliberately obstructing, which discourages citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan man I have a much greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I am without party arrangement of, without looking at the dogmas can take each party what is best for our country, and to apply it.
You consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or the left?
With Czech point of view it seems to me that my people are more related to the left.
For me do not matter a bit to the left or to the right.
For me, it is important that we go forward.
It is not about what someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.
Yavsegda will support any good for society, will offer its hrcm or group, and I will still be against bad idea.
You get angry when you say that you are populist.
But not prove whether you are what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal targets and views.
And for that you are trying to get closer.
You can call it populism, but the proposal, which I say, already operates in the world, or said about them prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament leaves just slogans.
And with that in politics you can not long endure.
Or do you think that when you go out to the people and talk with them, you will be able to implement and criminal liability?
I have no other choice.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on their side, that we have accomplished their goal.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to organize direct television broadcast, in which I will refer to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in the event of failure, will have to explain why it does not want.
If there will be a strong personality, which makes abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take direct election of the president - it was due to pressure from the public.
Speak directly, that I am a fan, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies, to assert their beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and the program will try to get the support of the majority.
The point I am trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails, it will take six years to complete and will return to the private sector.
This is partly because, as if the credits would save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one I will do nothing, so I went to a number of well-known people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.
I at least have supported investigations presswoman ján Lorentsov fraud, which opened with a light fuel oil.
I put forward his candidacy because people and was never satisfied, but now I feel at stake.
sixty percent of the people do not bother to vote, and most of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
We are independent in the Senate only two.
People chose the Senate so that changes will be made to work.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about your own party?
I have not thought about it, because I do not have time to check the cleanliness past every potential supporter, and I do not have the money to do so.
No money and on the presidential campaign, in my transparent account only 20 thousand kroner.
Not have the money?
Youspeaking property declarations, and how has your own business with it?
Personal wealth is estimated at about 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague cost roughly $ 25 million, based on 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, a collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston - Martin on 3500 thousand, and Skoda Superb on million, and several million in the account.
Kstati Aston - Martin, I have, because it was my first dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was Gallant, a charmer with women and at the same time against the meanness and lawlessness.
You travel to Aston - Martin, owns property in 60 million and you do not have the money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but its own money, especially in this is to invest not want.
It is not very convincing.
I do not have 15-million on the campaign.
I should get into debt?
The campaign I have already invested 2500 thousand.
The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I do not have to pay for the campaign out of pocket.
Spending on the campaign, I actually will cover senatorial salary.
But this money I would not have survived, for example, would not be able to pay the son of an English school, which costs 30 thousand per month.
If I wanted to make money, so they would not be running.
So, as you will be doing business, so as to be able to live?
Do you not told that will reduce these activities?
But it does not depend on the size of the paycheck.
As I promised her I partially diminished.
For example, managing director of a travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People wish that I had money, which will keep the Republic.
But I also want to do something for a living.
But, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive a monthly basis?
From two centuries before the thousand, which receives and beyond.
But if I became president, then their entrepreneurial over.
The full interview you will find in the Saturday edition of the newspaper "Right."

Architects mvrdv proves that this action is not only in the imagination - for example of Spijkenisse and his nylig knizhnoe mountains - 2 photos
"To me it seems cheerful, it looks futuristic, finally we have again you can see something interesting," says Lisette Verkhayg, passers-by on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermony, a specialist in it at the nearby large enterprises, consider this: "No, it is really beautiful."
But I ask myself why do we need today, another Library?
All Internet, iPads and e-books.
It is now no one voluntarily do not go to the old-fashioned library, right?
Spijkenisse, unattractive a town near Rotterdam, is a unusual record.
Its population of 80.000 is the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate fact a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the education and to build seven fictional bridges, as evidenced by the euro notes, as richly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they remained the only way to defeat the statistics: to build a library.
Blame Maas of Rotterdam artistural ubo mvrdv, master of bold bar charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical construction, toward the task with his usual calm and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the jurors looked puzzled look back and shoulders, defiant Maas Složil from its original gift Pyraminx in size and completed a speech in favor of the project following words: "Dear citizensg!"
Here is my suggestion: "The Mountain" in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!
nine years of these mountains cost 30 million euros grew.
It is part of a project of revitalization, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, and several adjacent houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, "The Mountain" was marked by a second prize in the "Best libraries of the Netherlands 2012."
The project involved in national Dutch Eurovision wodden semiramida 2012.
Thus, faceless suburb, all of which could offer nothing but postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly ugly ratusha, white facades which suggested the milk plants, has become richer for a contemporary works of architecture.
But most importantly - in Spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public buildings of cultural destination.
The long road to the book
First impression: knizhnoe geldoradog under the cap for cheese.
Here only one elevator, held in the center of the, for the fans and the reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.
Glass from all sides room is light and easily foreseeable, these bricks and elegant street lights accurately creates a sense of public urban area.
Urban environment was perfect.
Vzglad involuntarily looking for the bench, dogs and playing football for boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually bookshelf on the facades, and in mid-scandinavias a dark room, usually a comfortless and faceless," says you should blame the Maas.
We put a classic confguration of space on its head and pulled the zone read from the inside out.
Inner space knizhnoe mountains used skillfully: in downtown offices, libraries, Internet Chess Club, an environmental center and technical facilities.
Especially pleasant chernykh bookshelf, which serves the Wall, the, the stair railings.
Their appearance, textures and smell is unusual.
Even experienced architects and engineers roadway, ' what is the unknown material.
"We tried to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trauborst, the project manager, representing Opština Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of standard.
And once at an agricultural enterprises in Friesland, we met a suitable byproduct of Agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields lining in the Netherlands as the roots apply artificial fibrous material mm thick.
It is cheap and save time.
Thin textile an one - two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the Library of the painting - for the first time in this volume - was in the thickness of four inch.
From the heat and pressure so-called (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, durable material, the smell is a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
At the top are 105 steps.
Those who will go the length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafes not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and Wood Ficidae in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and primarily about proper humidity in the air on the literary Goré.
New soul
"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of the environment," says Trouborst.
For his heating and cooling is used by the warmth of the Earth.
Although the mountains are under the cap, even on clear days the sun hits in only briefly.
a farm of laminated timber, placed perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and assume most of the sunlight.
Air quality is very pleasant.
The rest of the defence provides a fully automatic roll curtains.
Stephane of Spermony, cited above skeptic of hi-tech jobs, has already visited the New Library.
Lisette Verkhayg also were already here.
As well as acting coach of traditional Chinese medicine synthia Bogarde, who called Bukenberg "Soul of Spijkenisse, which has long lacked."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to sacrifice one book from its own collection.
This book was to take the empty seats on the shelves are not yet fully featured kniznica - at the time it was 70.000 books.
It worked.
Shelves full of ground up.
"There is nothing worse than half-empty library" says architect blame Maas.
" I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way connected with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
Even if it is just for decoration.
Thus mvrdv managed to solve korolevska task that the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.
And they are very young and too uneducated.
It is only the starting point for the building of identity.

Szabo: "Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on the narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: in the early weeks of the German first made it clear that it will vote against the request of the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then Byrlyn abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany have to be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I believe that the American position she also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - while not speaking too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March of 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO held this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on a complex international issues?
Yes, it is true.
The fact that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely pepehodite from politics, so to speak, led by the us, the German foreign policy.
The situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a single coherent policy.
Thus, the Germans again is between two fronts.
Is expected of them, that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this.
I believe that the only fumble for a role, but on the path to "More normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy, which conducts France or Britain.
What exactly is "Normal" foreign policy with a German point of view?
This willingness to play in national positions, not dependent on the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. from exports and connections with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Economic interests fußball varies significantly from those of other large states, and therefore Germany must defend their interests.
Did this economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote in the UN?
First, Germany has the largest markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf of Mexico.
So it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I would not take it too much, it is not completely one-way communication.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Harmed if Germany to its relations with the United States, refraining when important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even the United States has an understanding of the German position.
So I do not think it was well as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germaniyadazh will acquire so certain respect.
It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that with its interests should be considered.
In Europe, there are different views about the Palestinian initiative.
The us, by contrast, is clearly in favor of veto.
Are differences of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
In force American domestic politics of these differences was always there.
I believe that the Obama administration in the back, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But with the local political situation the government, of course, can not openly to hold such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion is not as significant as it always is.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not happy about the policy of the Netanyahu.
Is it easy for Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and an important partner in the EU with others?
I think that is what makes the situation is difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not.
So they can not perform as part of a broader approach and is forced instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
They do with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will assume a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that for Germany is not easy, if only because of ties with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But I think the Germans clear that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as a major international player - not take it upon yourself really important role?
Or leading role still have trouble coping with Germany?
Germany is not used to it, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, is still always gives to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany takes on a major role is different donavan sense.
The Germans are not just to deal with it.
In fact, it is an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From the point of view of Germany is in much worse shape than the us.
It must take into account the various neighbors and opinion, and it is not easy.
So, us influence in European politics permanently weaken, but at the moment the EU do not fill this vacuum, then remains?
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like that, unpleasant or intensifying dislike kiriath plurarchy life!

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani - world-famous brands, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what Armani Polo?
It is officially registered in China's name, which has nothing to do with the firms, from names which it was founded.
Nevertheless it will be protected until the owners of the names will not file suit.
But then it is not clear, and whether they will defend their rights.
"Foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattlokh, attorney Taylor Wessing, specializing in the trademark rights violations in the Far East.
On the table every week appear on the new case of its kind.
Imitators to add a couple of letters, to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci to receive Lu-instead of Gucci, Prada, you can register a Prada-Kny.
The same way legally copied the German company, for example, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattlokh open the folder with records for the registration of trademarks in Beijing.
September 14, 2010 Chinese companies have registered trademark there zegna samsen Puma, artificial name, which used the name fashion houses Ermenegildo zegna.
That the Chinese are champions of the world copied and violation of intellectual property rights, known.
There are multi-storey department stores, which sells almost exclusively a fake.
But matters Pattlokh not so. On behalf of its clients they are opposed to the Chinese company is officially received from the registration of trademarks the right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "Ban Pollock," brand - passenger.
This word is associated with "Ban of nowhere."
So called women, who are hunting for wealthy men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize a wine
"It hurt business, with the need to fight," says Pattlokh.
"Trademarks are eroded, a unique position to lose, image suffered tremendously."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas were in million, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the company's market research clsa, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third-largest and fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
But to achieve the removal of questionable in the trademark hard, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattlokh tells of cases in which the court rejected claims, because after long opposed the name became "Reality of the market."
If there are lucky, he will have to pay a plagiarist, as damaged his trademark in China, says Pattlokh.
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
There are also in the case of graphics.
In 2009, Daimler lost the legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company, which acquired shortly before the manufacturer of transportations by concrete pumps putzmeister.
So they still have the right to use the emblem, like a star Mercedes.
Bought Volvo by Geely use a Blue - and-white logo, like BMWs; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Maker of trendy items lost in China at the shirts from Hong Kong and Singapore, which famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.
The registration of trademarks CTMO in Beijing confirmed that in 2010 because of staff shortages and outfitting there were obstacles.
But last year was "Returning from emergency in the workplace to normal."
So, the amount of untreated case on objections dropped by 22 percent.
It was almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for production in office.
Is to combat this expensive
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year in CTMO received more than 1400 thousand complaints about the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record and means that China for 10th consecutive years, topped the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the office.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5500 thousand items.
In 2011 was paid out 1800 million yuan of the charges.
To simplify, this means that each registration is averaging 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To overturn it is many times that, as a matter of fact, the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the fight against Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans have managed to ensure that the illegal manufacture them fake auto parts were removed.
But copycat has cemented its right to Chinese trademark Freudenberg.
It was their own shortcomings, as the surname in Germany can not be protected, said Hanno of Venttslery, chairman of the board Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.
And the registration of trademarks CTMO rejected claims of.
However, in both the authorities Freudenberg won, but the different factions continue the struggle until now.
We need to be vigilant
The issue is now before the Supreme Court.
Venttslery hopes to bring it to a conclusion and praising the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes our time, money and nerves."
Internal costs hardly be more difficult to obtain, the archive of the firm had to see even acts one hundred years ago, to give evidence.
five years ago Freudenberg in vain suggested the different factions "Big-digit amount in euro" for the settlement.
"This makes it clear how much that we are," says Venttslery.
The danger of the Far East threatens to spread even in Europe.
Namely in the case that imitators will register there for an unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this was able to prevent the registration.
"We need to be vigilant," says Venttslery.
As he and his lawyer Pattlokh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international position on the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should "All that any way is to protect, to register in China," says Venttslery.
Otherwise it may be worth far more than check.
Indeed, if Freudenberg will lose in the last act of his drama about a trademark, you will have to pay the other party licensing fees for its own name, explains Venttslery.
Otherwise we would go out of the controversial segment.

World Aids: to, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg rehearsing choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland of Aids orphans are happy with that.
The history of relations, who overcame more than 8733 kilometers away.
First razdavaysya: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' pumps and men's Slipper bore up time on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
Razès - two - three - four.
Only then slowly rising singers Alta, Bass, tenor and soprano they occur, and follow each other.
And Fita Hopf, 29-year-old conductor, just do not go out of their cloth shoes, when lead them flexible and expressive gestures.
The evening of Monday, at the music Hall of the Institute of medical psychology at Heidelberg choir Imbongi rehearsing new song.
The rehearsal have fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om" Obanya " There is a huge thing, every voice choir rcia text, in addition to a foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of the Swaziland.
Help for self-help
The evaluation Unaids, the United Nations programme to fight Aids, there are about 34 million HIV - infected.
23,500 thousand of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans of AIDS.
The more than 40 percent of the population is HIV - positive.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village Esitzheni Union voices for Africa foundmalm bosses in Germany.
70 of them in school, preparing for further study.
15 or 20 euros per month can take over the job.
It ensures childa money on schools, school uniforms and daily hot lunch at the Museum Center.
Imbongi on Zulu language is narrator or praise.
In this room do not speak briefly on the Bantu, but can sing.
Almost ten years the choir learn to play a song on this strange mild language and occasionally even bring them back to where they first appeared: in southern Africa.
For years at a distance of 8733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village Esitzheni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Infected forty percent
There are about 2000 people, some still in a simple huts made of clay and straw, among the many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus emberger.
In Esitzheni in miniature reflects disease of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest in the world, life expectancy, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision for men, which proved reduce the risk of infection by half, among the population almost not accepted.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland is in itself the human immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth selusin is not uncommon.
Choir opened this village in the joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants Imbogni saw a lot of children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but simply total: food, clothing, education.
Without the people in poor countries have no chance.
At first it was a private commitments of the individual participants - a few euros a year to send a child to school and to give him the opportunity once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later the choir founded the Union "Voices for Africa," which has almost professional care for orphans of AIDS in Esitzheni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What is the most important sexually transmitted disease?
To bacterial infections appertaineth, syphilis, chlamydia and (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral infections are HIV, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pubic Pediculosis and scabies treat parasitic infections.
What are the main group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
Institute of Robert Koch believes that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, the transmission occurs as a result of sex between men.
The heterosexual adults common sexually transmitted infection, is a chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and the human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we are relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are occurring in this group.
Among the youth of a chlamydia infection tbehind significantly more likely than other groups.
The European data, three-quarters of all infections confoundeth young people from 15 to 25 years.
We also among young people often human papilloma virus.
How the number of cases of infection?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Institute of Robert Koch, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections with 2007 contract.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
It is about one-10th less than the previous year.
The symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
With infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, a complaint with urination, a pain in the abdomen, as well as the bubbles or seal.
But often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and goes unnoticed.
How to protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not give absolute protection.
The partially agents of sexually transmitted diseases, can be spread by contact with infection and close physical contact.
So experts recommend regular screening, especially when the frequent changes of sexual partners.
In early detection can cure most gulnara and avoid distant consequences.
The job, donations and not least by performances of choirs across Germany allows something to collect.
"We sent in Esitzheni for about 200,000 euros" says Anneta Lennartts, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany manage Tsodva Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
It is also concerned that the orphans were well-built, for example of one of the grandmothers.
Gogos call on Zulu old women, it is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took to yourself to 14 orphans, gives them a roof over his head and make sure that children in the form of each day in time to appear at the lessons.
Of those who do not have any left home, is in an orphanage to Khaniysila, a lonely woman receiving a salary from the merger, as well as two supplements, which every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, the "Voices for Africa" wasog sewing school, built two chicken coop and together with American health Organization Psi wasog Braviaѕ of hiv test for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is evident throughout the country, prefer to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Anneta Lennartts, "Because he is linked to sexuality."
Unusually for a country whose king officially has 14 wives.
Last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on a state-sanctioned lifestyle also blame for the fact that the virus emberger so quickly spread in the past years.
But it is also a stray pracovny, which carry the virus in the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Anneta Lennartts, " But almost never use.
Other cultures - flesh to flesh ."
Just to support cultural exchanges, the choir Ibmogni every two or three years is traveling in South Africa and pesni, full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black identity, which many in the southern edge of the black continent apperceive since the days of apartheid.
Bus full of White, who sings songs on the black language - such recognition not only a good mood and joy, but even happened, evoked tears in the eyes of the rugged border guards.
Trip always leads in Esitzheni, where singers vipositiond sponsored children.
Despite the fact that small village with Labour can be found on the map, in Glen Etsulvenya it more than we are.
"Idi in Esitzheni, where light" the people here.
And after the 8733-kilometer-long flight back in Heidelberg, when singers get back in the rehearsal room on the streets Bergkhaymer, you can see that the light is also here.

Messenger: we open ice on Mercury
Probe "Messenger" found no evidence that the planet Mercury is ice.
The ice could have a thickness of 20 meters.
The us space agency Nasa has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although she is closest to the Sun, it is also frozen water, according to a three study published on Thursday in a special journal Science.
Probe "Messenger" found no evidence that are always in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
It measures must be at least 30 inches, and perhaps even to 20 meters.
Presumably, water is a comet or asteroid, perhaps, faced with Mercury.
Nobody connects the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said finsler probe Sean Solomon.
Temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But the finding could help explain how the water and other building blocks of life are elsewhere in the solar system.
Out to the citizens of the land probes, telescopes and small robots, for example, "Phoenix" explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send out of the picture: small Windows in endless gave.
Image comes with the camera, which has developed a German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.

In the brightly glowing galaxy with a black hole there is no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the big Bang, when the universe was mainly hydrogen.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably Telescopii was invented in 1608 by Hans Hans Lippershey - even before Galileo Galilei year later proceeded to watch the stars.
Since then, the Mirror of optical telescopes became more and more accessible - and their view of space deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, Telescopii "Khala" the Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
Zerkalo, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, a "Large Binocular Telescope."
It allows you to look into space by two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
"Granès Teleskopio Canarias" a gigantic internal device - diameter only zerkalo is 10.4 meters.
Zerkalo "Big South African Telescopii" in South Africa divided - to reduce the cost.
Nevertheless in diameter it reaches eleven meters.
The lack of inexpensive constructive performance: Telescopii firmly cemented the vertical angle is limited his mobility.
Telescopii "Hobby - Eberly" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
The features: high-collecting capability.
It is - despite its relatively small diameter mirror - parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listening to the extraterrestrial signals into space.
Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the project, "The search for extraterrestrial intelligence" (Seti), anybody with a computer can help by providing its computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European astronomical Service (eso) in the Chilean Andes.
There is "a very large Telescope" is entirely appropriate to its name.
His four zerkalo allows you to cover the Spyglass even mid-infrared spectrum.
In the Chilean Landessternwarte eso also plans to install an European "a very large Telescope."
His main mirror should be encouragement as much as 42 feet - and will be made up of nearly 1000 mirrored elements.
The photos should be expected before 2018.
2007 both Telescopii "Kyōka" in Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea is believed to be the largest in the world.
They found two mirror diameter of ten meters.
Telescopes "Kyōka" is part of the Mauna Kea, which along with them look at the Sky also with the "Subaru" and IRTTF.
Moreover, on Mauna Kea there will also be a giant telescope with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
Here to admire the illustrations.
But the most important species from outer space available space Telescope "Hubble."
Since April 24, 1990, he delivered a picture of a distant worlds.
With March of 2009 space Telescope "Kepler" looking for planets outside the solar system - the first such that there was life.
February 2, 2011 we reported that 1235 planet candidates have been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The picture was the last of the space Telescope "Kepler."
Space Telescope of James Webb (JWST) will be sent into space not previously 2018 aboard the rocket "Ariane 5."
The Mirror of infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the objectives of the telescope: he must in light of the first stars and galaxies to look for a big explosion.
Scientists suggest that the South Pole of Mercury is ice.
But there is no reliable data about it, as "Messenger" spin closer to the North pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades indicated that the Mercury is ice.
Launched in 2004 by the probe "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury - scientists now sure.

In southern Azerbaijan many residents reaches a biblically old age.

The search for clues in the country, where 97-year-old men seem still relatively young.
Trip through talysh mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
Minibus with a rumble is rolling on the trip by a dense forests of the mountains, turbulent streams and simple peasant houses.
Marlowe so Sehlen and brightly that make you think they are in Glacier.
But it is the southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers away.
Talyshs live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, which is known for being a bit, is not only that they are perfectly speak Farsi and azerbaijani and longevity.
The final point is the Lerik, Azerbaijan.
Small town to tout too heavy architecture of the Soviet era, which is not well with the picturesque landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost did not come here, the road from the capital, Baku too comfortable.
The 323 kilometer uhodite eight hours, as the road has only one runway.
Legendary wealth, which countries have oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not been reached.
But Pilate's zahidov (48), I am sure that in Lerik, Azerbaijan has much to attract tourists.
"In may, Baku is a Festival of Song Contest - and next year we will be held at the Festival of the oldest people in the world," said zahidov.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
It documented biography about eight dozen talyshs of these places, which for more than 100 years of zahidov points to the black - and-white photography.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years old.
At age 136, he had another child
But controversial star of the museum is Shepherd Kangarli of Myuslyumov, who allegedly was 168 years old.
Birth certificate, however, no.
But given that the oldest man, whose age documented, was 122 years old, the age of the Myuslyumov is extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," explains zahidov.
He was married three times, and he had 23 children, aged 136, he allegedly gave birth to her daughter.
It added Lee Shepherd's Myuslyumov of a couple of dozen years to their age?
Even Rembrandt scholze, a researcher of the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of veterans in Central Asia.
"Strikingly many people of advanced age can be found in some areas of China, Japan or in the Valley hunza in Pakistan," says Scholz, "In Sardinia also live has a lot of very old people."
But because of the lack of paperwork scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no registries of civil status.
Every day a glass of clarified butter
Yet there is a fact that people in the area of Lerik, Azerbaijan is strikingly often reaches the age.
Today, there are 20 people over 100 years old.
Why here, to the south, as many veterans?
Azerbaijani guide farida Mugimzad explain this particular genes talyshs.
The director of the Museum of zahidov, by contrast, believe that the real power.
Talyshs love meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them drink from a glass of clarified butter every day, but it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy and comprehensive point of view.

The word "Human rights" is not mentioned in the Constitution
Revolution was back in Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo is evidence of a deep split in the country.
The future Constitution, based on Sharia, met fierce fighting back.
The Egyptian president also had pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And its success lies in my responsibility to the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was paid to all people, but primarily to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular Egyptians.
For all of them, still hopelessly divided in an affidavit opposition, fear.
Fear of religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful "Muslim Brothers."
Mohamed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and broadened its competence, "To save the revolution."
But what really want to save the 61-year-old engineer, who have a doctor of the American University of Southern California, not quite the Egyptians and the world.
Will be denied power judiciary?
In fact 234 article has managed to smuggle in a 15-hour horse racing with obstacles in former anti-constitutional assembly of 100 members, and it is partly a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the procedure is based on "The principles of Islamic law."
But which means "Principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and the fear that Islamists will use vague wording and arising in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia.
At least a hint one on New article: in all cases where Sharia, should be encouraged to board the University of al - Achard, an important Islamist institutions of the country of great Authority in the Sunni Islam.
This should not, but it may mean that the clergy oversight of legislation that would de - facto consequenceuence restrictions of the judiciary.
The draft Constitution much is subject to interpretation
Another problem: the need to retain jurisdiction of civilians by military courts.
The courts during the rule of Mubarak has served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of dictator in military detention was up to 11.000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the state should protect "The true nature of the Egyptian family" and "To support its morals and values."
Legally it is so loosely that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control content even film and literature.
Clear text this means nothing other than censorship.
Geneassemblage no article does not set right the equality of men and women.
Zatos other forbidden to offend and defame the Prophet Muhammad, and that his envoys.
But what an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
It is also a dubious wording that banned "Defamation of people."
Enough to be a caricature of a president or a joke about the legal?
a matter of interpretation, like so much in this project, which Morsi offers a signature and which, in his words, "Very soon" Egyptians will be submitted to a referendum.
"Revolution returned"
For several weeks-made by the opposition against the Islamists.
Thousand people gathered in a unusual unanimity on the evening of Friday in Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy this document, even before he will be able to enter into force.
"The revolution is back, and we will win," said Khamdin Sabbakhi third-place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic energy agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said that the draft constitution place "To the dustbin of history."
, via a short novostei webinjected he accused supporters of Morsi's desire to lead a "Coup against democracy."
"If he will announce the referendum, we will go to the Palace and will take his" said opposition politician Yasser said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brothers are not yet" - quoted Egyptian media of the opposition politician, Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said that he did not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
Well-organized "Muslim Brothers," in turn, called for opposing the demonstration, but a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after the mass prayer, on the other side of the Nile to Cairo University.
The large number of women under the covers and supporters of the Salafis, who shouted: "The people that God's law."
They demanded that Morsi, "Ochisti country!" and said: "The Koran is our Constitution."
The struggle for power in the largely symbolic Square, where it all began, produced a state of virtual civil war.
Followers, Morsi, obviously, does not want to take this risk.
"The Muslim Brotherhood," said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution has spoken out loud and clear.
Now it is time to give people to settle at the ballot box, in what direction should go home.
Most of the project of the Islamists, it is considered been a done deal.
"The notion of" human rights "There is no mention of any"
Hafiz Abu Syed goeb from this forced the constitutional process, but one that was supposed to last until February, with the participation of all social forces.
48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (YeOPRY) defended the "Muslim Brothers," when Mubarak sat in jail or should be brought to trial.
Not because he shared their views, but because human rights for him is indivisible.
He was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now the word of "Human rights" never appear in the new constitution, sorry he is in an interview with the "Welt am sonntag."
Morsi's expanding influence on all three branches of power in the state is just a lawyer.
The measure represents a clear attack on the democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil state, President de facto annulled his" - sorry Syed.
It without civil society organizations democracy can not function.
Syed feel that left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.

Fafo iskra: the foul-smelling fish in the world?
He presided over the population of Norway, one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe but worldwide.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country to do with the local addiction to an extremely foul-smelling fish dish?
Take a few-overdue issue pieces of cheese.
Place them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Ostav' them there for a week.
You will receive smell the odor iskra is one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a little town called Fagernes, in three hours' drive from Oslo.
Around snow Zhivopisny species. It is very nice, but quantity of ineradicable.
Rakfisk is trout, sprinkled with Salt and circulating in water up to a year, depending upon which Duska must be achieved.
As the gathering dusk and, a crowd of Norwegians are going to the Festival in Fagernes on the, shall we say, exciting dishes.
"It is raw and with a glass of Aquavit, local vodka," explains Havard, Khalvarsen, local fire by profession and "Manilov," who runs the Festival.
All around us, people have a small cubes fish and with its considerable drinks.
"Someone like Aquavit than iskra Havard," says.
This drink is to smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
Will Yesliudat' to take part in the nose, then it is not so bad - is not much different than serving sushi, which you have long carried with him on the bus.
Rakfisk is Norwegian product of a different era, the Times of poverty, when, before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the autumn in a sealed barrels with salty water.
Then deep in winter, when the fish are already well and thoroughly, it removed and, perception of alcohol, used in food.
Another memory of the past generation the fact that thousand Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mostly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly, with more than 13% of the immigrants, who is here jobs, higher wages and developed social security system.
The people of Sweden's (long-time rival, and it was not so long ago and far more affluent neighbor) massively come here to work.
Rakfisk is seen as an important symbol, a foul-smelling, albeit somewhat datagridview past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($ 14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and the majority of the country's population seems to suit.
People here still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, racist and extremist right-wing, who had last year and killed 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, one called "The events of July 22."
Nordafjells very hard to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens were capable of such atrocities and murder.
The basis of today's well-being of Norway is the (since the early Seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, getting trays with a spark, a woman with long blonde hair and startlingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic welfare.
We have such people - if you call - rational.
Like the majority of Norwegians, she is fluent in English.
We do not like to be demonstrative, we are not may be boastfully.
Norway very carefully treat their oil - greater share of the oil and gas industry to invest in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when all money, which they did not have, Norway employee was calculating all costs.
"As long as you can go skiing in winter and summer to go hiking, that is enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there is a spark" she added with a carefree laughter.
I am standing in the snow in the queue for any food - iskra enough is enough.
Here are Hamburger with Moose meat is certainly something exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But tonight we expect more of the same fish with unforgettable smell.
In my hotel holds a special dinner on iskra, in which visitors vote determines the best, or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
Go live on tv, which shows leading in the bow - tie, surrounded with bowls with iskra.
It is like the Eurovision Song Contest " ."
"So, Tor - Jürgen, the assessment you put the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Havard,, here is our assessment..."
All laughs and applause.
Someone fall from the chair, perhaps, was Prett Aquavit.
Or maybe just the smell of the fish.

Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is got his early career.
As the newly elected President of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to take office, told BBC will grant invites us to look at the difficulties that he will have to face, and the mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Road in Mexico now in particular pickle.
This town is overloaded transport and in the best of times, and Monday was erected steel barrier, several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
But it did not, so as not to give people to get a job in the suburbs, and to prevent the protesters to get to the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto will wear the presidential sash and will take the reins of the country.
He is faced with the daunting task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance in the administration of Felipe Calderón, which is now taking shape its powers, but the countries involved in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed about 60.000 lives.
"My government says the people of Mexico is ready to fight violence," said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto, US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
To such statements itbeside the US president of the political career of Mr Peña Nieto has evolved as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in densely populated and extensive state, the capital of the country, opinion about the new leader is deeply divided.
Straightforward man
In an idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, about him fondly remembered.
Residents puts him the revival of tourism, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure.
You can reach the City on a new highway, built by Mr Peña Nieto's WMDs, which is a far cry from the roads with potholes and bumps, which was previously at this place.
a placard with his name on the modern building of the Sports Center and the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We associate with him hope for real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state representative from led by Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect this and decisive change, which is so badly needed in our country, especially in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 consecutive years in power, the party PRI was ousted in 2000, Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admit that after his 12-year absence in the presidential palace Los Pinos parties are pinning high hopes on Enrique Peña Nieto.
Suranjan by the emptiness, which launched a new president, opposition.
He is very straightforward and very committed to the realization of his vision for the country's future.
It is a great statesman, and, above all, a man who is listening.
But in other parts of the state, many people will have a different view of the former governor.
The Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the Ciudad carried, is the most striking contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under flyovers of highways in many ways, he is a suburb of the Mexico City.
And problems in the municipality also wear dour character of this metropolis.
Earlier this year for the pacification of gangs, drug-trafficking in these areas, were involved troops; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
On a vacant lot near the vast landfill in the last two years alone, was found dozens of bodies of the slain women.
More than thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the government of Mr Peña Nieto is significantly higher than similar measure in the notorious for violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name, when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr Peña Nieto, about it in the best possible to say that during his tenure as governor he could not cope with the problem of the murder of women.
In the worst case, his administration accuses in complete disregard of the problem.
In concrete homes, like the majority of homes in the ramshackle neighborhood, irinej Buendiya with Labour holding back tears, showing me pictures of his late daughter Mariana the moon.
Official version Mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
But her family thinks that she killed her life partner.
"When I came to her home, it seemed that her body before that washed," says Ms Buendiya.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body had became benumbed.
The mother of the Mariana retell the story, and a portrait of his daughter look at us with walls, where he hangs next to a crucifix, which has only one word: fairness.
It is in this, they said, was denied these families.
" Officials of the state appealed to me like the old gossip girl, disaffected of calm.
They want people to simply accept on faith all that, they say, and why.
But it is wrong, so you can not, especially when there are so many irregularities and errors ," she said.
Wearing presidential sash on Saturday, President of Peña Nieto with it will take a heavy responsibility.
Over the last six years the thousand families in Mexico affected crime-related violence, and the new president promised to make the issue a priority during his rule.
"I hope that he will be the same president, which was governor," says Olvera, a congressman from the Valle de Bravo PRI.
But it is the most feared the family of the victims in Ciudad carried.

Cross-examination as part of its review of the defence request that proceedings Manning on the grounds that the terms of his sentence was cruel and itself was sufficient punishment, was held the day after Manning said that while in custody, he had intended to commit suicide.
Military specialist analysis of intelligence, who was arrested in June of 2010, accused of the abduction of the thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published online by the website WikiLeaks.
Resurs WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was Manning.
During a hearing on Friday, the procuratorial with Menning looked at reports, which was filed after visits Manning administration officials during his years in jail Kvantiko, where he was on a strict regime of conclusion from July of 2010 to April of 2011.
During his visits to the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about reports, Manning acknowledged that evaluates addressing himself from the administration of the prison as "Excellent," and the conditions of confinement as "Very professionally organized."
Examined reports do not contain allegations of mistreatment, despite the fact that Manning directly asked about the conditions of his detention, said Sinn Fein.
Manning replied that he expressed concern about the use of these problems and that members of his administration officials discussed with him the problem and have stated that they will do, but not fix it in writing.
"They recorded" the problem is no " (after discussion of my complaints), but that does not mean that I have not raised the issue in a conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning, why not complained of mistreating him in January of 2011 during a meeting of the Commission dealing with the suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning said that at the time of the meeting, he wanted to ensure that it was stripped of the regime of "Prevention of injury" and softened conditions of detention.
The military leadership explained that limited the regime's conclusion - level lower than the regime of supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect prisoners, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to give to know administration, that to me all right, that they end the regime of preventing injuries... To level my life has improved, from my point of view," said Manning.

He said, that the thoughts of suicide appeared with him in Kuwait, and that one day he fainted because of the heat.
He explained, because it is very difficult when you can not even know how to solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
" My world shrank to base camp Arifzhan, to my prison, said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I would die in these cells ."
While in Kvantiko, Manning, he said, much of the time a small camera - at least 21 hours, or even more than 23 hours a day - in solitude.
Manning said that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blankets, slippers, a few items of clothing and sunglasses.
He says, he tried to move, so as to sleep or even simply lie in the daytime ban rules.
Fujio Manning, during sleep in my eyes he was constantly Semantron light, which outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face, when he turned over in bed at night, then, in his words, his budili and forced to turn over on his back.
Lawyer Manning filed an objection about mistreating Menning in January of 2011.
In April of 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Moreover, on Friday, the judge asked Manning's statement, which he made at the time of testimony on Thursday, about the fact that, after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Kvantiko, he is forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates for morning inspection.

Protectng said that plans to offer Manning to admit guilt for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of hearings scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution would be to insist that the conditions of detention was justified.

My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunity to realize their potential.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they resemble the country's residents about the difficult times.
Ruben Navaretta believe that Mexicans of American origin is torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico I walked down the corridor for arriving, approached the area of border controls and remained in place.
Signs pointed to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
a few seconds I stood before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was known as the Mexican.
It is just a name, just as my friends in Boston call himself Irish, and friends from New York see themselves as the Italians.
Later I stopped at the complex structure "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Is here, in my grandfather, there was no need for a title or complicated structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions and answers.
But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers of the language, and I can not get rid of an American accent.
Because I took his American passport and was in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda was customary for meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
The President of Peña Nieto to speak about the rise of the Mexican economy, whereby Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, rather than to go to the United States.
He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
Moreover, President of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not sound.
For Mexico's relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grievances question.
Most Americans have never really thought about that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and, at the point of rifles forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and sees a reminder of the events in all.
It is just any statesman to utter a word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society they had heard complaints about what Americans would infringe on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And descendants of montezuma are filled with militancy.
The most complex is Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about grievances?
Them enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are in this country the right, and those for whom such opportunities are not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - have not had the opportunity to realize their potential in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
This was the Mexicans of a particular type - dark, education, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember this.
In Mexico, see it differently.
Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we are taught in high schools and I got a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream - American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination, confused and unclear, but we know how to treat as his.
The United States of America.
Ordzhonikidzevski, we know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.
We meet them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as a people's second-class, as a fake Mexicans.
We are not speaking Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not leave.
We have not had the silk curtain, finding in the US Fed up life, but lost a spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US as a kid and it reminds me that between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans there is some friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Mexican Americans are upset.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belong to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintance Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to none of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Tigres Del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose their roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
In the US call us Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during his trip, as if our relations already are not confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans worked as a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We would be able to tell their friends - Americans, which is a beautiful country and how well her to visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Will not do.
Too many grievances in the past.
But given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not perceive these countries such a beautiful.
I am sorry, but I can identify themselves, location.
And rightly so.
If a majority of Mexicans still can not forgive us how they interact with Mexico and a half century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still in the offense for the way most recently in Mexico the treatment of their relatives.
Yes.
Perhaps, we have more in common than it seemed to me.

Old battle of the new Middle East
Of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas can become fragile foundations for further peace
The prospects for a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
It sounds, the debate over, senseless, who first began; many buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, released from the Gaza Strip of rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel's Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his old conflict in the Middle East have change.
This can be interpreted in many ways, but the events of the "Arab Spring" swing round at the Bure scores of well-established reality, and the Palestinians and Israelis failed to stay away from the vortex, rocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more violent than previously.
But there is no reason to give hope for a way out of this deadly stalemate.
War without winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if a cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be kept firaxis this week's clash only strengthened the position of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will announce the fact that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite incurred losses.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the group were killed and 1.7 villagers blocked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas build its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian-controlled territory currently more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders are likely to conclude that the work for them.
As the rising influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas is more influential and wealthy friends.
a resurgent regional leader Turkey, which once was the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, expressed support Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing countries of the Persian Gulf.
Triumphant Hamas supporters claim to create around Israel's Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the militant group, Hezbollah, and Syria, which increasingly Islamist insurgents are about to topple the government of Bashar Assad's, and further to Jordan, where the power of the king threatens allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region have occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab countries, in Egypt, where President Mohamed Morsi have strengthened the influence of the movement the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are a lot like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic constellations Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "Hard" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israeli missile system "Iron Dome" meet the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas rockets.
Citizens of Israel can sleep well, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the US has remained true to its unchanged position; many European countries also blamed the latest round of violence in the Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, some 30 Israelis were killed by missiles launched from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the walls, which comes to the territory of the West Bank - a significant portion of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protect Jewish settlements, which continues to grow despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party - as part of the preparations for the January 22 elections - teamed up with even more bellicose conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, a very convenient.
What sense to pander to the Palestinians and to give them their own state?
To give their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, will not start if they can run from there rockets at Israel, as does their brethren in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to raise their heads.
Perhaps supporters "Hard" line will win; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.
With the Islamists, who comes to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be the internal problems.
Defense part of the budget of Israel more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
Pragmatism of Egypt's president, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on a cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of a change.
Israel, no less so, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As the advent of democratic change in Arab countries, deprivation of the Palestinians' right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later Israel in the occupied territories, like the bus, exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression have undermined the basis of democratic order in the Jewish state, and demograficheskii - growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates the problem.
The bloody operation, which is held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the movement Hamas, has to pay the growing discontent with the international community.
Both sides need outside impuls
Remains the only solution, which tirelessly encourages sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: two-state solution and concessions Israel's territories in exchange for security.
Hope, not too impressive in the short term, is little hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to contribute to the side of the conflict.
Egypt, which is past time to make a decision to cut off the supply of weapons in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar has, as ever, advantageous position in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts towards reconciliation of the movements of Hamas and Fatah.
It would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming UN vote, which could be a recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
Our role is to bring the Israelis to the negotiating table, to play and President Obama.
During his first term he did not own the peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he is still showing reluctance to connect to solve the problem.
It is disastrously shortsighted position.
The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

In Australia became the law to create a unified and packaging for cigarettes.
Warnings about the hazards of smoking and image startled cfp body parts in contrast, stand out in the dark green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world to Australian law on a pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color registration of different-the same box is glum - olive color with eerie snapshots the affected parts of the body and images of children, whose health has been smoking of their parents.
Pomimoraznyy pictures and captions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the stacks, imposed on with this Saturday - name brands, which published the same fine print.
This is the most severe in the world of conditions for packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia said that the purpose of these measures is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of fashionable status.
The basis of such a decision were the results of research showing that people are starting to smoke to 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 will never become smokers.
"Obviously, the very young age children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring the tobacco company with the help of the packaging" explains, health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing research showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of Princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes will not affect earnings transnational corporations, the impossibility of those measures have already seen and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of black market, which will be sold cheap cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought the initiators," says Scott MacIntyre, a spokesman for the British American tobacco in Australia.
Producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will provide more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, by contrast, the new laws and the growth of the business.
Sandré Ḫāʾ from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd said that demand for cigarette and silicone cases, hiding unpleasant picture on the packaging, rocketed (almost from scratch) since the two months ago, companies such as British American tobacco, British Imperial tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan tobacco lost in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to appeal against illegal.
Arifoglu Sandré Ḫāʾ Zico, the company has already implemented some 6 thousand products enterprises of wholesale trade and expects the New Party.
For us it is good business.
Potential impact on the effectiveness of such measures are, according to the experts, the popularity of social networking among the part of the population that is directed towards the least.
After taking in Australia of a series of laws illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support for their sport events, as well as prohibiting sellers to make cigarettes in plain sight, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government forbade local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it can not limit in the foreign sites.
"If you sell tobacco products and you have only a small idea to promote their wares on the Internet will show you a very attractive," says Becki Freeman, an issue of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman increasing number of reviews on trademark, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, the social networking sites like Youtube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether this was the work of the ordinary citizen, who are so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare effort and time and made a video, or behind this advertising company?
The Australian unit of British American tobacco has said the industry is now more busy adapting to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the new rules: the state made no claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying the trade has been unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries' trade with Australia are poor.
Wco decision is expected by mid 2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of implementing them similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada's first introduced mandatory placement of photographs, warning about the dangers of smoking.
In the rules adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening of laws are seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Number of smokers in Australia has not obey innovations.
The picture I did not touch them.
I just do not pay attention.
"Merely draws a cigarette and hide it in your pocket" said Victor Al Haig, buying cigarettes with photos of cancer of the mouth of the pack.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.

In the world of electronic networks and constant connection is not all bad.
In this Thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, because our plane was discovered a mechanical problem and he was replaced by another plane, which we and awaited them.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I am not going to kid.
Noon at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help either books or magazines or iphone, nor even the duty-free shops.
But in recent years, scientists and experts in child development is speaking out in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to get bored is not so bad.
This makes the brain to be distracted by an interesting related topics, which probably contributes to creativity.
As in the modern world, we are all constantly any screen, the advantages of boredom pass us.
Maybe we need to strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time.
We will be back to that.
I, like many others, believed that boredom - invention relatively recent days, when people have more free time.
This is not so, says Peter Twohy, a professor of Greek and Roman history of Canada's University of Calgary, author of "Fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a lively history, Yale University Press, 2011).
"Actually boredom has a very ancient history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii found a Latin inscription of boredom, dating back to the first century.
The remains an open question of how we understand the boredom.
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed.
The research on this topic and asked the question a task force in 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "Want, but you can not do what they would meet."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that bored people do not do something that would like to do.
With apathy nothing to do not want.
Primarily from boredom, he says, is "a violation of attention and related deterioration in mood and feeling that time is as slow."
As boredom may seem very similar to the Depression.
However, Professor Eastwood said that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the cause of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself.
Sometimes we feel that we are bored, when in fact we just difficult to focus on something.
In his study "One reason: the definition of boredom from the point of view of attention," published in last month's issue of perspectives on psychological science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to previous experiment, participants who listened to tapes of voice, reading a magazine.
The participants heard a loud noises not related to the case of the programs are included in the next room, others have heard these same sounds on low volume, so their, you could barely make out, and a third group only listened to the recording of a voice without any soundtrack.
The participants, who heard the low volume, noted that they were bored, more than anyone else - it was hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it is boredom.
When we are trying to focus attention on the difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, said Mark J. Fensk, associate professor of Neurology at the University of Gvelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "For example, studying in the flow of the products in the pipeline in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is, he says, that when people start is riding on a chair to portray scribble on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in reality, such actions only helps not to relax physically.
"Research has shown that children who are not prohibited to fidget and to turn, learn and remember more information than children, which required to sit" says Professor Fensk.
In some moments, we bored: for flight delays (in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, watching this film.
But many people are showing less prone to boredom.
In the 1980s to measure the individual features researchers have developed a special "The scale of the propensity to boredom."
The definition of such scale used questions and approval, for example, "Much of what I have to do, monotonous and unrelieved" or "Me too much fun, so anything that is not enough time."
With the help of these questionnaires researchers found that boys skuchaem more girls, says Steven Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially if there is a variety of external stimuli.
But teenagers generally often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he connected with the help of a pager with as many as 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% said that they get bored in school and at the time of his homework, and 23% said that they get bored out of school.
The only 3% of parents said that they get bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that, "The teenage peak prone to boredom," largely because children and adolescents do not allow in position to decide what they will do.
Back to my initial question: boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme, studies show that it can drive people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says professor Vodanovich, dedicated study of the problem more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something different, and this is the boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But that the brain does not always know what it is better to do it.
If you are going to be bored and you will find the energy to play the guitar or culinary experiments, you will make yourself better.
But if you get a TV, you will be better for only some time, and soon it will pass.
So, if your child missing and you give him the iPad, he will not be bored, but he will not be able to contend with boredom alone or in other ways to manage their time and employment, says professor Fensk.
"And the skills of self-regulation is in various situations," he says.
Your child learn not only themselves to occupy himself something, he also learns self-control at all.
I do not think that boredom should like to praise.
But there is something bad is not worth it.
Rather should learn to feel comfortable even outside a continuous stream of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agree.
"We see that, we need more likely to suffer boredom, with the boredom is very unpleasant, an insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he said.
In fact, people are eager to show off the persistent worries and just relax.
"In today's world we are used to the constant over-stimulation of the sensory organs, he says, and when silence, we are lost and do not know what to do."

It is unclear how the new law will apply for the legalization of marijuana in Colorado
Anthoney Orozco, a nineteen-year-old player of the football team and a student of public college in southeastern Colorado accused of committing a criminal offence, which holds that will soon be quite legitimately throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamar and drove in a car on the prairies near the border with Kansas, when they stopped by police.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco had subpoenas for possession of drugs and devices for possession of drug use and petty crime, for each of which is due to a fine of $ 100 - and the date of the trial.
"With us be dealt with as criminals," says Mr. Orozco.
But the offender is he?
As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for several weeks after Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of thousands of small-scale litigation depends less on the law, much of the discussion.
Charged with crimes related to marijuana, has already been filmed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped condemned people aged 21 and older for possession of small amounts that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks day.
But in the more conservative counties in Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the cases related to marijuana, and still held liable for the drug.
At the same time in some cities to the suburbs of Denver before the mountainous areas of the West's vote for it, in order to prevent the emergence of their places new licensed by the state of shops selling marijuana.
"It is growing so fast that I do not even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora on the east of Denver.
The regulatory authorities in Washington state also puzzled by scratches his head.
They are to be established rules for determining the order of the licensing of production, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and it needs to be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for good or evil, ahead of most of the other states in the regulation of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, first, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," said Brian J. Smith, a representative of the Council on the regulation of production and sale of alcoholic products in Washington state.
But now no one can do more, says Mr. Smith, rather than to put forward any proposal and hope that it would work.
"We have no real precedent on which we could focus," he said.
Bill of Washington, called the I -502, will enter into force on December 6, and the whole year will put the state in a state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing is not, and the right of possession of marijuana has been legalized.
But there is still a difficult technical aspects, which must be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the disposal of the state of "Adequate access" to licensed marijuana from a ban on trade in her at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"Particularly difficult it will be to place a licensed Enterprise on trade in marijuana in a line of cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs" said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently released study "The centre of the legalization of marijuana."
November 21 the police chief Oates of aurors sent his subordinates by e-mail message that the prosecutor's office of the town will no longer bring those who have reached the age of 21, with responsibility for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops caught people in these violations "From here."
The police chief Oates said that the police will monitor respect in the town of rules governing the activities of those crops such as marijuana for medical purposes, and will continue to prosecute traffickers and distributors of drugs.
Prosecutor Weld County in the north of Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill he said that prosecutors will still be held liable for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the people who take medication.
The 119 people charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, though many of them are accused and other violations.
"The responsibility of our institutions to pursue the action, which is considered a crime at the time they were committed," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
Reaction was mixed even in places like rural Mesa, where voters rejected a proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
Police Grand Junction, the largest city in the region, no more accountability from adult, for possession of small amounts of the drug.
Attorney Pete Khauttsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take the allegations are already open cases connected with possession of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law, as long as he does not change our direct responsibility," he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado, who took part in the vote, upheld that decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And contradictory reactions of people in different places of state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to experiment Sinfônica with marijuana.
"The County prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier" said Sean MacAlister, Denver lawyer representing convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana.
"They are so long people behind this is that now can not really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he said.
Colorado and Washington, the first us, in which to a small number of marijuana are just as to alcohol is destined to become a pilot flying across the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.
Advocates of legalization and officials of the state's plans to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are apprehensive waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is scheduled to consider a sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Advocates of legalization of marijuana in the hope that the Department of Justice will concede on this issue.
Despite several have received wide resonance of arrests of traffickers and patients who marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases to agree on trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents by the anti-drug is unlikely to break into houses, to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to the regulated by the government of the state of the recreational marijuana, which is allowed under the new law, said Kevin a. Mahvash sabet, a former adviser to the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Before the presidential elections of some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for sale of marijuana, which could not open up sooner than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a corner of the state, put forward for consideration-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in a position that we will give somebody a license, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now there is a contradiction between the results of local elections and the vote, for which the state.
There remain many unresolved issues.

Petronella of Uayetty: I have survived from Oxford for what I am conservative.
Bonnos University students for their views did not begin today.
As I can remember, I have always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described him as the best in the world, educational institutions, the modern equivalent of ancient symposium, which the two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, his studies at the Department of Worcestershire College of Oxford University in the late Eighties, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father would not survive and cried.
Friends was confused.
Newspaper the evening Standard claimed that I dropped out, because I do not like it that my classmates have sex in the next room.
Writer Norman C. Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from Viktors Ščerbatihs cups.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I ran away.
Yes, ran away, because I was systematically hounded and intimidated.
Not because of my unusual name or what I attended a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this famous cradle of enlightenment it was this barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Uayetty, was an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You ask, why not to think about it now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students, which the center-right views, are subject to the same bullying.
The institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of students - conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students took the same protection of their rights as those who are granted disability, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the club of Corpus Christi College in Cambridge said that their "Often actively isolate, subjected to personal attacks and makes you feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter in the Committee on equal rights of the College of additional representative to ensure freedom of expression of opinion.
The situation only worsened recently on the BBC 2 documentary about politics in this field "Wonderland: young, smart and right," in which the Conservatives presented the eccentric and neo-Nazis.
The film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of conservatives of Oxford University, who ride in Rolls - Royce, wears a silver suit and stick with silver bedknobs.
In other university students - conservatives complain that make "Scapegoats because of rising school fees."
Lucas black, 20, vice president of the Association of conservatives of Nottingham University, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper said that " In the university environment is increasing imbalance in the side of the left.
People that we do not even know in advance if you think we are arrogant and unpunished unruly children of rich parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the history faculty of Corpus Christi College, which was to strengthen the protection, called the atmosphere "a comfortless," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, the new president of the Association of conservatives of Oxford University, said that the attitude of the members of the club to the media of the center-right has deteriorated.
"It is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, or simply to normal life of the club," she said.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was one.
I came back in September of 1986, a timid and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford overtures from hatred of the Conservative Party.
The year before, the University of voting deprived former student, Margaret Thatcher of her a honorary degree because of a reduction in the budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even the Stalinists.
In the first days of the week, when the freshman students work with each other and with professors, I felt that was waiting for me to come.
I did not know that teachers not only did the harassment of students - conservatives, but gladly took part in it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and disagreement of governments to apply sanctions against the government of apartheid in South Africa - seeped through vaulted wooden panels walls of classrooms.
In my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the 18th-century English, and I was not prepared for what followed it.
"Miss Uayetty, said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, I invite you to move your first paragraph."
The text, gave me hard, I hemmed.
Harry Pitt was very Tylopilus man with a face like a cake.
"Tetcheristy damentally not teach French or they simply did not have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students maniacally:.
On my eyes were filled with tears.
"I advise you to take the first French lessons in their free time, unless of course, very busy, rotating in society" - Pitt.
I returned to my room very unhappy.
That evening in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, second-year student in the Department of English, which is presented as a member of the Association of the Conservatives' University.
" I know who you are friendly, he said.
- Unfortunately, things are as follows:
Over every, who is suspected of being sympathetic to the Conservatives, will get me down.
I am very easy, but in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most of the freshmen - conservatives pretend that they Labourists ."
Later, in a local pub, I timidly tried to play.
I insisted that do not agree with all that says Margaret Thatcher.
Trick failed.
First-year student of philosophy, politics and economics, who studied at Eton, said: " You are the daughter of fascist pig.
You are contagious ."
Other students picked up his words.
I was damaged, dirty.
" As the Conservatives have sex? ' asked one of them.
- They beat each other, right? "
, I suddenly felt like I must have felt homosexuals to criminal prosecution of the Sixties.
Will I ever to live normal lives in Oxford?
Or I will have to meet with like-minded people only under cover of night?
Will I have to be a Labour and to conceal their true beliefs?
The year three was to be hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, of his conservative views, was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
His hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speechwriter.
In college, he has not appeared.
He despised him for provincialism, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist - determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you will not be happy" he told me.
I started to go to Oxford from parental home in London, seeking refuge with relatives and unbiased torrevieja friends.
I told my father that hate Oxford and explained why.
He did not believe me.
During his school in the forties there were any political views.
" But though it is the best universities in the world, said he is dismal.
- There for this fails, not in the town of slumbering spires...
Even my friends - Communists always behaved impeccably ."
His eyes moist.
" Do not take any hasty decisions.
I am sure that it is just a joke.
You will get heart, if you throw University ."
I was exhausted regular trips to London and my emotional protection faded.
My friend, a conservative, could not handle the pressure and abandoned its belief.
Next week during the seminar, when a teacher of history is seriously called me "Enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In my soul screamer from shame, I was brainwashed "I have parents," and called them "Old fools."
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was going to score my father.
Every week at the time he wrote two columns for newspapers, owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I am not a member, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they are gone, I packed a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never returned.
Can call me cry-baby and rags.
But in eighteen years, nobody should become the object of such anger and intimidation in educational institutions.
The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only produced fourteen prime ministers, the Tories, but is still behind undeserved reputation of the university, which cherishes equality and dissidence.

The hardest profession in the world: the miners with Kavakhi - Idzhena
For € four Indonesian miners risking life and limb, 70 pounds of sulfur on top of the volcano the steep, cobblestone paths
There are people for whom their work - hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them Anthot Widjaja, one of the 400 miners, which earn a living production of sulphur in the volcano Kavakhi - Idzheny, located on the Indonesian island of Java.
Each day Anthot descend on the bottom of the crater, where sulfur dioxide, rising from the depths of the Earth, freezes on the air.
Otkolov huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo basket, will place a basket on his shoulders and carry them out on a steep cobblestone road.
Of the volcano, a height of 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted men more than 40 minutes to climb a snail's pace, with Labour holding the balance and careful road, so as not to fail and not to fall off a cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened with one tourist, France, which took off a few years ago with Skała Kavakhi - Idzhena.
Miners with Kavakhi - Idzhena earn 5 eurocents per kilogram of sulfur, which produces
Being at the top, they clear a road between them tourists, who photographed, as if they were monkeys from the circus and wearily carrying heavy basket, walking three miles to the scales, which mining company located just above, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
It is about PT of Kandy Ngrimbi, the company, which has been running since 1960, the volcano, and it is best not to say, its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro) per kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10.000 rupees (83 euro) petrochemical plants, because this mineral disseminated in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening of sugar.
"As the transport 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each" explains, we Anthot, which usually runs three daily carrying case.
He spent three hours on each of them and, in the end feels broken, but it allows him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems little for such superhuman efforts, it is more than triple what he would have earned in the field.
"Journeymen diecimila miners are very high by local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is 2 million rupees (167 euros) ," says truckers, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75.000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and plot was not that hard, but Anthot returned with his family in Banyuvangi town near the volcano, for good reason, that Indonesia is as devastating as sérou: "I married a girl from Bali, a Hindu, and brought her in Java, she had converted to Islam."
The Anthot asthma, he is breathing with difficulty, constantly cough, and he has the redness began to weep, eyes because of toxic gases

He has asthma, he is breathing with difficulty, constantly cough, and he has the redness began to weep, eyes because of toxic gases, which secrete volcano.
That is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"Will work for two more years, because they want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French" promises, he is on a more than passable English.
Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at the hotel, but instead he perform the duties of a mule.
Dividing dirtyyou wooden huts with other porters, he gets up every day in two hours of the night, because sérou not stop to emerge at night, when her distinctive yellow turns into the Blue and shines in the darkness.
Challenging Theneuille, Anthot descend into the crater, illuminating his way with a flashlight, connected to his helmet, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters drag the basket with Gray on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, mining company not mechanized production sérou for cost savings and does not provide any equipment porters, who works at his own expense and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not even get parts of 30.000 rupees (2.5 euros) collection of photography, which, along with a ticket for 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the Zapovednik charged with tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its people - mules.
"This work for cattle, and not for the people," said Badrusin, a stocky and the Porter, who spent 42 years at Kavakhi - Idzhena three decades, since he left college.
Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he said he will accept work "As much as we can," because he needs the money for the education of their three children aged 18 to 10.
Will not retire, will die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although sérou is burning throat and burning eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catch miners in thick plumes of smoke from the volcano, they are so Hardy, that no one complains about their serious illness... More serious, obviously, than their normal breathing problems, trouble, the pain in his knees and sores on his shoulders, which is most under the weight of baskets.
Hovering basket on his back, Unaynik now only can lift 50 kg in 53.
Every day he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three truck transported to the warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers on the narrow path among the Bushes of.

Singapore looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accuses career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore will need to rise."
My husband patriot, you are my wife were, follow our civic duty and will create a life!
May seem incredible that this is part of the advertising of some peppermint lozenges, but despite that - or perhaps because of this is a video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
This phrase is part of the rap, which uses local proverb like "Let's put Bao (roll) at the stove" to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.
Advertising agency, which made this video, bbh, hope that, with the help of advertisements they will be able to draw attention to the problem in entertainment form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music, for people to fulfill "Its national debt."
These things exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is a major problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing themselves, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government tried to do much, for example to implement the launch of perfume with pheromones or to relax the rapid dating (blitz - visits).
Many of these ideas, perhaps, a creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make the most creative things from possible to solve the problem, namely to compose rap?
1.2 child
Who do not take it so lightly, it is the government of Singapore.
It spends $ 1.300 a year on policies for the enthusiasm of the citizens at birth of a large number of children.
State package for married couples and parents provide up to $ 15.000 per child, extended maternity leave and provide tax relief.
But it has low efficiency.
Singapore is rich and high-tech city - state in Southeast Asia, also known conservatism of its leaders and its strict social control.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to the National Directorate of the population, are currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of the walk - in 1976.
Why Singaporeans do not have a large number of children?
Tang Wei Min, director of the branch policy for couples and families of the National Directorate of the population, says that this is "an Education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"It allowed people to have a wider range of options when it comes to life's goals and priorities, in addition to the marriage and the family," explains it.
These changes of social norms and the growth in the number of bachelor and postponing marriage and the birth of a child, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims to a sharp increase in immigration to counter the decline in the population, causing outrage among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, which is barely disguised xenophobia in respect of many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who criticized for keeping salaries, and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration is regarded as one of the reasons that last year the ruling party of Singapore was the worst result in elections since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the birth rate has known impact on economic growth, the nation's tax revenues, expenses for medicine and politics of immigration, the example of Singapore also has some unexpected consequences.
Government efforts to be built so many small house.
For example, is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
Manual on urban development proceeded to control the number of small apartments, known as the "Shoe box," which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments 46-square meter very well be sold.
However, believe that they can foster bachelor lifestyle and deprive the incentive of developers who want to build a large family house.
But Lim Yu Sun, the director of the House-building firm the developers, says that the "Shoe box" is selling faster than larger specimens.
They are more popular, in the sense that the apartment is sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than the apartment of a larger size.
The result of our cash flow increases.
Nevertheless, he concedes that the new rules give a clearer guidelines for developers, which had previously been obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too badly
Singapore is a city - state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking with Singaporeans, who works in the financial quarter of the centre, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very overstretched, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people are put off," says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and housing prices and education as the reasons that make it difficult for them to have children.
So, how would the government nor has taken pains to encourage citizens to the birth of children, as regards to childbirth, a final word to the Singaporeans.

Interviewed five people from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they are associated with the term "Something very my" in personal terms, and "Password and username" when used it to the social networks.
"My biggest secrets I would not have downloaded in the post" says ten-year-old Jorge, when trying to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he is already two years.
"It is a secret, my mom can to know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On fb I downloaded a beautiful picture or a picture of the games.
I have fun with their friends.
"I would not urustemova fotografiu, which is not mine, or someone who behave silly," he said.
The boy realizes that bad to publish indecent photographs of naked people, crime or write abusive or violent comments.

Most of them relatives.
The mother of course, there is a password to one account.

"If I would be to pressure or to simply remove them from your account" - he admits.
Josz became a follower ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
The boy never experience of what is now known as cyberbullying.
One my girlfriend had blackmailed into the social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He would not know who it was," he assures us.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete account.
"Only included confidentiality."
He explains the sequence of steps to set up the account safe way.
Unlike Horhe, this would be rebooted fotografiu familiar in an uncomfortable or situations.
Yes, I would have done it if I do not like or if I feel like it.
"Even though I know it is cyberbullying" - confirm it.
Key issues
Maryelos Porras, our teacher of English and an expert on education and training, said that to keep the children and teenagers, need to realize that goal of social networks - to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she notes.
Porras indicate that academique Mark Prenski, master of pedagogy of Yale University and author of the Labour digital natives and immigrants, invented the term to explain this phenomenon.
Digital natives they are the ones, children and young people, who was born in an era of technology.
"We digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she said.
Explains that the issue is complex, "Because we are asked to have a certain criteria for what can or can not distribute, publish or to speak, in the age when it is not enough for this."
"Also to be selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, to have thousand friends, not thinking about the consequences" she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confdentiality children and adolescents, is to ask questions, which makes them to think.
"To tell them that they did not do it, it is useless" she added.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you can not tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would have been happy if published the photos you like the one that has published you about your friend?
Do you know that other published about you?
When you sign a photograph with the parties, asking whether you are letting other people, to commemorate them?
And another, everyone needs to know, what are you doing in every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they should behave online, the same way they are offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet rights deal with respect, responsibility and other principles, as should be on social networks," she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, a professor of primary education and consultant on education, explaining the need for leaders of the families have read a policy of social networks.
With each of the points they have good reason to talk to children about the implications of the discovery of the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish," he said.
The Gaurdiya, the key question is to remind children's lessons "Do not talk to strangers."

"South America should learn from Europe in the issue of the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of a common citizenship is the goal, in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, Peru, state television said that Europeans "Kill each other during the second world war," and in other clashes, "But now they are practically one country."
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing the South American citizenship, which approves the members of the Unasur.
"We need to get the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is happening with members of the Andean Community, but until now there is a reactionary sector, which wants to take us back to the past" - he warned.
Ecuadorian President has shown himself, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition for reducing the influence of the Anglo-saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the pact San Jose on human rights.
Those who lecture, never undertake no obligation, and we in the South Americans, by contrast, signed by all.
"Inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum, the Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that does not regret this decision, because he betrayed its principles, and comply with its "Profound values of democracy and human rights."
He added that in due time "Was a suspicion that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be honored by the process."
He criticized, moreover, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged sexual crimes, while "The Swedish legislation to make it through video conferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not talked with him ever since he arrived in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problems, nothing serious," said the head of state.
What does have is a danger of worsening his physical and mental health because of imprisonment in a small space without the opportunity to do the exercises on the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity, which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and stressed that the talks in London in search of a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of the WikiLeaks.
We are not talking about human rights, the word in this case we do not use, but there were constant debate.
"I think the solution is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because a lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzón, is a series of processes in various European institutions" - mentioned it.
And said that "If Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will be over."
And if Sweden, as it allows its legislation and well as it did in other cases, will be examined by Senor of Assange in incitement in London or will question him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that does not tolerate "Mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distorts the freedom of expression."
"The enemies of freedom of the press is not spoiled villains, politicians, and journalists, supporting the speculative, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained bullish that are neither these journalists, "Neither bankers, not bourgeois country - faced no rule in Ecuador," and added that, after being re-elected, "Will deepen the Revolution to the sustainable development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain veto of Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the agency "Must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support of coups in the mask of legitimacy" because in reality "It has eroded the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
Ecuadorian President found, moreover, "Perfectly reasonable" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to are now negotiating with Nicaragua's maritime borders between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which is in favour of nicaraguan morskaya sovereignty.
At the moment it is observed.
This problem between South America and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome the desire to go together.
Need to handle them together to overcome them and to continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries, which is in the same court Peru and Chile, and said that "The right thing for Latin America to go to the International Court, if the two countries agree to accept the decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
About the opportunity to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third term, he pointed out that he considers this opportunity "With optimism and joy, although sometimes quite hard."
Correa assured that if I lose the election in February of 2013, then from public life.
Personally I have never been interested in power, but in this unjust situations, as in Ecuador, socio - economic poverty can be amended only by the political power.
"My political movement considered, I am the one who has guaranteed the likely victory, so you have to accept this responsibility," he said.
If it would be my last term in office of the president, and then we come out of public life.
If you lose, the same.
"This decision," he is confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to the treatment, which is already planned, the routine, and that it is expected that he will miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the aggravation of the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the state took part in Lima today in vi summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration for the maintenance of progress, equality and security.

Deaths from AIDS today - a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"I was as if he" - he recalls the difficult, despite all the time of the moment.
He concealed it from his family.
By deciding to cope with the disease itself, he wanted to know more about it as much as possible. And his efforts were acquitted - he is already celebrated its 43 birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "Oldest" patients HIV - office of the hospital, hospital civil de guadalajara (hcg), where he arrived in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives with the diagnosis "Of the human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) is 22. In the early 90s, it would be hard to believe - too little then there was the treatment options, too little known about the disease, too was prejudiced against him sick.
Even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "Because he had cut."
In other words, in those days to have AIDS was a verdict.
Now possible to survive the syndrome and do it, not to the detriment of quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about the illness, still many people come, when the virus has already damaged, "Depleted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first alleged, "Great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same," Bulgaria's head of HIV - secession hcg, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that the information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a verdict, however, life expectancy and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, available to patients with early diagnosis, with a better life expectancy of those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when it reported 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV - positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "Maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess the progress, we should remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today to an average of 76 years.
Although death rates have declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the annual report, Unaids), also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths to may this year; however, that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why still have a lethal outcomes?
- Personally, it seems to me that the problem was not access to treatment.
The way I think, so it is in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years, there was no shortage of drugs, the problem is that patients come very late, because of his positive status, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He led a devastating this: "nine out of ten patients come in when you have any opportunistic infections; what to do to have a bigger impact on the overall mortality is to make assessments at an early stage, and it is therefore necessary to provide samples to detect the massive scale, for all people, which it will ask."
In its proposal has the same opinion experts and officials of the State Council on the prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), and the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who went to check on private laboratory, motivated by nothing but his friend and, despite his young age, he was already on the stage of AIDS and even had Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the more common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think I will die, and do not want to know.
"Razès will still die, I will be nadiraeshsya three days a week" - they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat, do the exercises, taking medications.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have many occupations, I travel, lead an active sex life, but with a shared responsibility, and take care of other people" - listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to make his statement of those who now, in the context of the World Aids day, scared.
Let him test, if there was a risk of infection, even as possible know whether they are HIV - positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other man, being responsible.
It is his message said the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Big gap between health programs and ordinary citizen, fguring Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who started the problems associated with HIV.
Andlargest this Prevention.
In places on this task, "Actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were one or two, we offer packages for hundreds, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why are you?" it is a popular question, with and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teens, said a propagandist.
Proposes to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for me and to hundreds of thousands of them were in vending machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
It does not promote promiscuity.
That is not about the payment of beer and motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked, the prospects for the distribution of condoms in his leadership.
"It is not sexual, it is best to make condoms available for those who already have sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
Recorded 13.435 total cases of HIV-AIDS (12.158 and 1.317).
The state ranks 4 in the national rankings for new and total cases of AIDS and 13s for HIV.
92% of infections are related to sexual way through blood, 6% and 2% for Perinatal way.

Given the ratification of the United States Court of Appeals' decision, which cancel debt restructuring of the group vitro, achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the script set a dangerous precedent for any national company with branches in neighboring countries, which have a problem with solvency.
It seems that the procedure in support of the survival of the firms, which allowed Mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In practical sphere, approval of the decision made by the June 15 judges Harlin Hale in court of bankruptcies of the Northern District of Texas, left defenseless Mexican firm in the face of the possibility of the seizure of their property across the Rio Grande.
But the ruling opens the door leading producer of glass in Mexico for an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, resulting in three, the discrepancy.
As the entry, while the judge it notes that lenders should be regulated by the US bankruptcy code, Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, based in New Orleans, said that the trial for competitive production, seen in Mexico.

Secondly, the verdict stated, that without the Inter-firm vote, acknowledged in a critical mass of competitive production of debt that was before the parent company branches vitro, would not have achieved majority needed to approve the restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity will recognize Mexican laws.
In fact, vitro was not the first time that it takes the scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose Inter-firm debt guaranteed by the federal Institute of competitive industries.
It is also true that subtracting the voice of branches, somehow giveers vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely funds "Vultures" like Aurelios capital, Aurelios convergence, was Internacional and Liverpool limited, does not have a majority.

Hector of "Hetin" Reyes, "Basketball was my life"
The avid basketball journeyman Hector of "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years to do with the sport and, thanks to him, over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico stored in memory so many basketball stories, as Hector of "Hetin" Reyes.
And it before brain stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player in small groups, the player's top basketball league, Commissioner and chief Internet with the Cowboys Bayamona and President of the Federation of basketball.
"I have done many roles in basketball over the course of his life, including several at the same time, when I was President, Internet, the director of the National Federation President in the 90s," recalls Reyes during the visit, the Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes not exaggerate, making this statement.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia items collected for his long journey, evidence of that.
Bayamón, Puerto Rico in the heart
The emotions he kept those who remember his way through the Cowboys, since the mid 50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years of his performance in the single - mandate agent or an agent of the contract.
" It was my best years, which I enjoyed most of all, because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight world Championships, the Cowboys from 1967, as the agent - agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including the five world Championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome's in the Internet.
From the moment and will continue to lead a "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator " - said Reyes.
I remember that Gina Bártová, which went down here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong player, rising 6'7."
"Do you want?"
And it was early debt, one of the best players, who was in Puerto Rico.
Bártová then recommended that the sniper raimonds Gauss, which received citizenship and became one of the top scorers.
I remember that said if the debt brought the Championship Bayamona, Gauss would help to win another.
Having the Cowboys with Gauss I enjoy, but at a distance, because the 1988 were part of the head of the Federation.
By the time I just want to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments supposedly in the national team.
Remember how we won the first time the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 world Championships, where we got the fourth place and it was supposed to be a bronze for the Canadian judge, who made us to beat the final game, said Reyes.
The team to the 1990 world Cup is the best team, what you have ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as those that have won the dream team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite were the ones that with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the United States, which was quite similar to those that we won bronze at the World Cup.
To the team not only once again played Minsky, Gauss, remon Rivasa, Fico of Lopez and "Pikulina of" (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) "Tonito" and James Carter Bratya Leone (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote of" Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 because of a knee injury.
Team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team's Olympic qualifying tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-players like "Kanito" les Neus Pablo Alisea and young rolando of Khurruitner for players, temporarily suspended for the mess in the Pan-American Championships mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, it was Pikuliny Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level, like Pikuliny.
And that does not include his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best gentle head?
It is a very complicated issue.
We had a very good young animals, including Julio Toro, Flora of Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Lluís Dalmau Armandito Torres.
Of young, I really like the work of Leo Arilly.
What do you think his main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s the Internet had 17 teams in the season.
What you need to do?
There were things that I wanted to do, for example, the regionalisation of smaller categories.
For example, that the boy Ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now guys go and play too much, and it is over.
At least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and of course for governors, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing?
I listen to music, watch music videos my time on Youtube, enjoy your grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, and C Abel, which has always been with me.

The Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he admitted that he drank for many years.
In 1995, he discovered a malignant tumor in his liver and he underwent transplant.
Long before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television because of the role of honest type in a light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," which were televised by NBC from 1965 to 1970.

The course, which explores the "End of the world?"
Every week, students explore the apocalyptic events, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when a professor of religion Stewart sharma decided to read the course of the end of the world, he knew that he was irresistible bait: the end of "Long countdown of the" Mayan calendar, December 21, who seized many people as proof that heralded the end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call the "Long-term," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where the Christian theorists of the end of times I believe that it is the apocalypse.
"I did not realize that this will be the most apocalyptic terms of all" said Sharma this week, students at Rutgers University - Camden (New Jersey).
If you analyze what is happening in the world today, as if we are only 30 days, it was a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those with apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme of "The End of the World" in this semester, the latest in history.
At Temple University associate professor Barry Wacker-reading course of "The media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students explore the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why this idea is spreading," he said, and the way in which offers a hypothetical scenario, of certain actions of the man.
If nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, can get the war.
This month, students analyzed films on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with the real-life examples.
"I tried to tell students about what is possible, perhaps, it is impossible," said Wacker -.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America, Matthew Restally and his colleague Hamars Solari, associate professor of the history of art and anthropology, gathered to read the course, which is called simply "The end of the world."
"We do not add '2012 ', to always be able to read the course again, if the end of the world will not come," said Restally.
Despite the "Destruction," students should learn to cook projects and to take the final exams.
At Penn state final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that does not leave the students of other choice but to work "To the same night, in which is expected to be the end of the world," said Restally.
Courses have been quite popular.
"The place is over for two hours," said Restally about its course for students with the highest average score, which has recorded 35 students.
We received an e-mail message for weeks before the semester from people who asked whether another place.
Students, in turn, says that this course one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch, which makes people, to console himself" said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of separation of religion and sociology from Khaddonfild, New Jersey, in Rutgers - Camden.
And apocalyptic thinking, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Vekes, 25-year-old student of the Department of Psychology and nursing, said he watched the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of course, which would teach this" - he said.
I like it.
But none of those surveyed students - not to mention the professor - has said he believes in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited" said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the latter course at Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restally.
But he noted that there was an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back centuries, where people respond to changes around them, often predicting the end of the world.
The Internet have expanded the speculation.
"In other places, people do not think about it," he said.
In the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question about whether he knew any rate of "The End of the World" there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world" - he wrote, referring to the order of the Supreme Court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restally noticed that has long been talked about for many days of the recent Court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "People immediately think about the next date" or saying that December 21 is the beginning of the year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refers to that date.
Some said he was going to go to parties of the "End of the world."
"Maybe, call someone from friends, to some laughter," said Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student at the school of communication.
