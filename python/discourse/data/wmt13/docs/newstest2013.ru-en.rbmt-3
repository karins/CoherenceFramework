Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's repeated election
Leaders of republicans justified the policy need of fight against falsifications on elections.
However in Brennan's Center consider the last as the myth, claiming that cases of falsifications on elections in the United States are more rare, than death cases from a lightning stroke.
Besides lawyers of republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years.
One can be told with confidence: these new tendencies will have negative impact on a voter turnout.
In this sense similar actions partially discredit system of the American democracy.
Unlike Canada American states bear responsibility for the organization of federal elections in the USA.
For this reason the majority of the governments of states since 2009 adopt the laws complicating process of registration or vote.
This phenomenon received new scope after elections in November, 2010 which brought to republicans of 675 new places in 26 states.
As a result only in one 2011 it was accepted 180 bills limiting a vote in 41 staff.
New laws on elections demand from the voter to show the identity card with the photo and the proof of existence of the American nationality.
Besides, these laws reduce the period of early vote, abolish the right of registration of the voter in day of will and take away a vote from the citizens having a criminal record.
To elections of 2006 any American state didn't oblige voters to show the identity card with the photo.
Indiana became the first staff which entered the similar requirement.
The Supreme Court of the USA confirmed constitutionality of the law adopted in Indiana in 2008.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice and to other states.
Within two last years they initiated the bills obliging voters to show identity cards with the photo, in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec the American citizens have no such universal identity card, as a card of medical insurance.
Really, 11% of the American citizens, that is 21 million people who have reached age necessary for vote, have no identity card with the photo, their staff given out by governmental body.
Besides, five million new voters in 2012 have no similar document.
Thus the cost of obtaining the demanded identity card often exceeds hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionally mention youth, minority and people with low level of the income.
Really, 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the people earning less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of citizens are more senior than 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years have no demanded identity card with the photo.
But there is more to come.
To students - voters who as it is considered, vote for candidates from democrats, in several states it isn't authorized to use the identity card with the photo, given out by their educational institution.
But the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote generally for republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs for vote.
Till 2004 any staff didn't demand the proof of existence of the American nationality for vote.
For the first time the similar requirement was entered in Arizona.
Since 2011 more than ten states adopted the laws demanding from voters to prove that they are citizens of the USA.
These measures, obviously, are aimed at limiting vote of natives of Latin America.
It is considered that two thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of Democratic party.
Besides, republican legislators initiated the laws abolishing registration of voters in day of vote in eight states in 2011.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wishes to be registered.
This restriction didn't take place without consequences.
So, for example, during elections of 2004 campaign for registration of voters helped to enter about 10 million citizens in lists.
At the same time the measures taken since 2009, led to falling for 17% of level of registration of new voters in 2010 in comparison with 2006.
In addition republican legislators adopted the laws aimed at reduction of the period of early vote in five other states.
So, during general election of 2008 in Florida of 33% of the voters voting ahead of schedule, were the Afro-Americans though the last made only 13% from total number of voters of staff.
The same happened and to natives of Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they made 24% of citizens which voted ahead of schedule.
Unlike white which, forming 76% of voters, among voting ahead of schedule made only 46%.
Certainly, democrat legislators and their supporters actively oppose adoption of the laws limiting registration of voters.
Some drafts of laws were vetoed by democrat governors.
Action of the most ambiguous laws was suspended at intervention of the General Prosecutor of the United States.
It allowed to limit negative consequences partially.
So, for example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the laws demanding presentation of the identity card with the photo.
Nevertheless, the new rules which have taken effect, certainly, will complicate electoral right implementation on elections of 2012.
Critics from democrats condemn bias of laws which were adopted, seeing in them an obvious orientation on affecting results of elections of 2012 in key states.
The report of the center of Brennan of 2011 shows that the states which have adopted these laws, present to 171 of 270 voices necessary to electoral colleges to win presidential election.
Still too early to claim with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of an electoral system will have essential influence on results of presidential election of 2012.
Only one is undoubted: these new provisions will have negative impact on a voter turnout.
In this sense similar actions partially discredit system of the American democracy.

Screening of a cancer of a prostate gland: to be tested or not?
Actually, the test for the DOG yields sometimes wrong results, pseudo-negative, and sometimes and pseudo-positive which lead to useless medical intervention.
To men, and so reluctantly passing medical examination, is from what to begin to doubt even more.
To be tested or not?
We asked opinion of two experts.
In the researches which have been carried out in the United States, numerous cases of infection among groups investigated therefore it is difficult to interpret the obtained data and difficult to develop any accurate recommendations were observed.
Other research, this time European, found a different death rate in those patients who passed screening, and those who didn't pass it.
This research also showed, after 12 years' supervision that the probability of emergence a metastasis is 30-40% higher at those who didn't pass screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to be tested since 50 years, or with 40 if one of direct relatives had a cancer of a prostate.
Men of the Afro-American origin are also subject to the increased risk.
The key moment is adoption of the correct decision as soon as the cancer is found.
The cancer can be both aggressive, and slow.
The patient needs to explain degree of risk of its cancer disease, offering it possible options, without an obligatory cancer therapy of a prostate which doesn't pose hazard to life in long-term prospect, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active supervision over a disease.
Today, many men at whom the cancer is revealed, won't receive medical treatment as their cancer isn't aggressive and doesn't pose threat for life.
We will offer them active supervision and if the disease starts progressing, we will begin treatment.
Even more often we with an accuracy define criteria for making decision on the one who has to or shouldn't receive medical treatment.
Thus, I would recommend to be tested after all.
But it is important to consult also with the doctor to define, it is necessary or not to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International association of urology, Movember created the tool, allowing to estimate everything pros and cons of passing of dough for the DOG.

To prevent an illness
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful recipe to prevent a cancer.
Despite progress of scientific researches, observance of a healthy lifestyle remains in the best way to reduce risk of a disease.
It is considered that if all people fine ate and moved enough, 30% of cases of a cancer could be prevented.
"If anybody any more didn't smoke, this figure would increase at least to 50%", - emphasizes with Andrée Beaulieu, the press secretary of the Canadian association of a cancer.
However, by estimates, 10% of cases of a cancer are caused by heredity.
Some types of a cancer remain absolutely inexplicable.
For the Canadian association of a cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite reduction of number of smokers.
Smoking is connected from 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is risk factor for many others.
It does enormous harm to human health.
"Even today in Quebec 1,5 million smokers are", - press secretary Andrée Beaulieu speaks.
The encouraging fact: in 10 years after refusal of smoking to die risk from cancer decreases half.
Weight
According to CARAT data, the excess weight and obesity also promote emergence of a disease.
They increase risk of emergence of a cancer of a mammary gland, thick and a rectum, a gullet, a pancreas and a uterus.
"Researches show that regular physical activity during all life protects from a cancer of a thick gut", - add in Association.
Food
The association also recommends to limit consumption of red meat.
In too large numbers it increases risks of emergence of a cancer of thick intestines.
It is necessary to avoid also sausage products.
Meat preservation by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to formation of cancerogenic substances.
"The last can do harm to cages of an organism and lead to cancer development", - explain in Association.
Vitamins
In recent years many scientists were engaged in research of influence of vitamin additives on cancer development.
But at present it is impossible to call results of these researches unambiguous.
According to SCC, researches of vitamin E yield inconsistent results.
If one of them showed decrease in risk of development of a cancer of a prostate, another yielded opposite result.
In an assessment of influence on development of a cancer of vitamin D also there is no full clarity.
However Mr. Bolyyo emphasizes that it is important to discuss the alarms and the family anamnesis with the doctor.
"Delivery of the analysis doesn't lead to a cancer".

Higgs's boson in details
Past summer the message that the scientist, probably, was succeeded to find Higgs's boson, caused a big agiotage - and not without the bases.
It is considered that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the Universe, neither more nor less.
Besides, it is the last particle which existence was predicted within Standard model - our the best, or, in any case, the "least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of a matter, - but which didn't manage to be found by practical consideration earlier.
But physicists isn't up to the end assured yet that it is a question of Higgs's boson.
We know, without a doubt shadow that we deal with really new particle and that it bears a strong resemblance to Higgs's predicted by Standard model the boson.
Besides, the new data presented this week on one large physical congress in Kyoto, apparently, it confirm though for full confidence of some data yet doesn't get.
Let's present nevertheless that it is a question of Higgs's boson as chances to be mistaken seem minimum, and we will look that it means.
Is, in this world one law absolutely inevitable, saying that two things can't appear in the same place at the same time.
To bypass this rule there is no opportunity, don't try at all too diligent, differently do much harm to itself.
But though the physics of elementary particles is quite strange world, it appears that in it too there is one law of similar character: the principle of an exception of Pauli which postulates that two particles can't occupy the same space in the same timepoint if they stay in same "a quantum condition" is "condition" consists, in general, in their some characteristics.
Proceeding from it, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find the respectable citizens called by fermions who reasonably submit to Pauli's principle.
In other bosons, a mean gang of anarchists which have no respect for anything - at least to this principle that means fuss that they can appear very quietly in the same place at the same time.
As reports a site (by the way, absolutely unusual) Berkeley Laboratory Particle Adventure, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: мезоны about which we here won't speak, and "force particles" by means of which the main forces of nature extend and to which Higgs's boson in some way concerns.
These bosons, it is necessary to emphasize, not all such exotic beings as it would be possible to think.
Actually, if you manage to read this chronicle, it thanks to one improbably banal boson: to photon, or "light particle" which is "courier" of electromagnetic force.
Really, when one particle having an electric charge, is accelerated or changes the direction, it "breaks" an electromagnetic field in this concrete place, approximately as a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "violations" the electromagnetic wave (light, either the infrared radiation, or an ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is than other, as a photon - and, therefore, one of bosons of "force carriers".
Stabler field
The same happens and to Higgs's boson, to that only a difference that in order that this boson appeared, other field, Higgs's sex has to be "broken".
However Higgs's sex much more, is much stabler than an electromagnetic field; that to raise it, it is necessary to reach very much and very high energiya as though it was a question of the frozen pond which surface very big stone could shake only.
That is why the huge accelerator of particles, as what is exploited in ЦЕРНе - a Large Hadron Collider being a ring with a diameter of 27 km is necessary! - for achievement of such huge energiya.
The analogy to an electromagnetic field is useful as well to a ratio explanation between Higgs's boson and weight.
Actually, not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others - no: the sheet of paper, for example, itself will never keep on the refrigerator.
In the same way, not all particles interact with Higgs's field: what interact, have the weight whereas others (as a photon, by the way) have no it.
So, what "can bring" all these researches, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
In science they are used for check of correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physics to grope a divergence between results of supervision and forecasts See.
Besides some of them passionately thirst that such divergence was found since the slightest discrepancy can open a door for "new physics" and stop up some holes of Model.
The last, it is necessary to tell, still has essential shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravitation (oh! ) or for a dark matter which forms about 80% of the Universe (very oh! ) .
But while in ЦЕРНе such divergences didn't find.
Consequences
For an everyday life of the average person it is more difficult to predict advantage of these researches, but would be a mistake to assume that it isn't present.
You look: at the very beginning of the 60th years pioneers of researches of the laser in Bell's laboratories couldn't even assume, what revolution will be caused by their works.
They expected their appendices in science, but no more than that.
Really, already late physicist Uillard Boyle who worked in Bell's Laboratories where in 1960 the laser and who itself developed the first continuous laser (previous was invented were pulse) in 1962, I said that originally the laser was considered rather as "a laboratory gadget".
Present...
And besides, the appendix can be for the tools accompanying research.
For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during the optical researches in 1969 developed the small sensor of light.
This sensor though it at all wasn't its initial mission, serves now as "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize on physics of 2009.
It, certainly, doesn't mean that work of the Large Hadron Collider will surely change our life, but it only shows, actually, that everything can be.

The palliative help - the best way to die... | "Debt"
In the Commission for worthy death in Quebec the delicate question of the end of life recently was discussed.
Debate soon has to be resumed, and the bill at this time prepares.
Nevertheless in this major area a lot of things still should be made.
"Debt" tried to look closer.
Only several weeks ago mister L. still lived one in the apartment in Monterezhi.
The cancer of a prostate destroying it from within, granted it a delay for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived seven", - he speaks, between life and death, lying in a bed in a shelter of palliative leaving Victor-Gadbua in Grow white where arrived the day before.
"But it always shock, it is impossible to be prepared for it", - he speaks.
The illness does the work: improbable weakness which doesn't allow to go independently to a toilet and even independently to eat.
Sitting at a table on which there is an appetizing dinner, he is given and agrees that to it helped to accept food.
He is invigorated, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work round it, bring it drugs, conduct it in a bathtub.
Courage before usual death.
"My biggest desire that me cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating", - he admits.
Some hours later the personnel I found medicine for this illness.
"During life us teach that the man has to urinate standing", - Pierre Brodeur, the psychologist in Victor-Gadbua shelter tells.
To regress to a condition of the child - for some intolerable humiliation.
"Everything depends on ability of the person" to reconcile to decline, - he claims.
As, according to many people who are engaged in palliative leaving, important events случаяются and in the heat of this decline.
Patients who arrive in a palliative shelter Victor-Gadbua, everything are suffering from cancer.
Forecasts allocate for them at most three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses doesn't provide more the help called by "medical".
Mrs. A., 89 years, most of all are afraid to die "in consciousness of asthma".
But the illness allowed me to recognize the children.
"I have good children", - she adds.
"I more want nothing in life", - she speaks before allowing to deliver it a mask facilitating breath.
She still waits in the next few days for the last visit of the son who has arrived from Italy.
In a shelter Victor-Gadbua by means of group of volunteers give care of a body and the help at a food.
It also is palliative leaving which remains when nothing more can be made.
To make death of more comfortable.
In Quebec one place is the share of each 11 700 inhabitants in establishments of the palliative help.
It isn't enough of it, considering that sooner or later all of us will die.
Here life goes on in the best conditions what are possible, doctor Christian Martel - one of doctors of a shelter explains.
Whether it be comfort physical, emotional or sincere.
Dying we will agree to provide oral rinsings from brandy or Pepsi, looking that he will ask.
Diabetics we any more don't force to supervise sugar level.
And the death is part of daily occurrence.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. H., which died tonight.
In the morning his son drank up this beer in feet at the dead.
"We help relatives as well as patients", - are told by Natali Savart, the director of care of patients.
In a shelter Victor-Gadbua any day isn't similar to the previous.
Near the 93-year-old old man who enjoys the last meeting with a family in a yard, having settled down on the pillows during a toast in his honor, the young man of 36 years surrounded with parents, the wife and two small children and pereprobovashiya everything tragicly dies to survive.
"In the last half a year from three to five beds, are always occupied by cancer patients aged till 45 years", - doctor Christian Martel anxiously speaks.
53% of the patients accepted in a shelter Victor-Gadbua, arrive from the house, and 47% from hospital.
Problem of access to palliative leaving
It is considered that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative leaving, that is to care which is given to alleviate suffering of the patients who have entered into a final stage of their life, whether it be at home, in hospital or in a shelter.
And some establishments, such as a shelter Victor-Gadbua and Society of palliative home care of Big Montreal, specialize more or less only on care of cancer patients.
This big gap in health system of Quebec forces many doctors - specialists in palliative leaving to be afraid of the adoption of law legalizing euthanasia and the help in suicide.
Since October the manifesto signed by stars in the field of palliative leaving, doctor Balfur Mauntom and doctor Bernard Lyapuantom and testifying to their disagreement with a similar initiative circulates.
According to the doctor Christian Martel, the health system of Quebec is insufficiently effective to provide the right to quality palliative leaving before transition will be allowed for euthanasia.
Recently, - she speaks, - I saw the patient who spent 14 days in ambulance office, in terrible pains, and nobody took necessary measures that to facilitate them.
I am afraid that patients wish to die only because they don't receive adequate leaving.
At the same time, many oncologists till last day try to rescue patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes of Elaine Richard's survival already were minimum when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told to my oncologist that I stop treatment, she answered me that regrets that I stop fight, - she tells.
Thus she said to me that my days are numbered!
Omnipotent leaving isn't present
Doctor Martel considers that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank medical staff, that they didn't satisfy their request after the team on palliative leaving relieves their pain.
However it should be noted that palliative leaving isn't absolutely omnipotent in fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monro, the director of palliative leaving in the society of palliative home care of Big Montreal, patients aren't susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life doctors often resort to a palliative sedation at which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or is constant.
It is impossible to pretend to be more that we don't know about these sufferings.
In increasing frequency patients who don't manage to relieve pain, will be able to have access to a palliative sedation.
The patients suffering from pain, always tell the same phrase: "I want to die".
But it is meant not necessarily "by me want that to me carried out euthanasia", it is meant "by me want that to me it became easier".
Creation of this reporting became possible thanks to a journalistic grant from Institute of researches of health of Canada.

Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec
The officials responsible for a construction of roads, construction contractors, collectors of means of political parties and specialists in the Italian mafia tell day after day that they know about the enormous "system" entangling the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade-union figures and the mafioso.
"Industry" which very much cost much to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious as this system is scattered after all means were put on use, Jacques Dyusheno, the deputy and the former police chief of Montreal" jokes.
Exactly thanks to it in 2011 scandal as a by-product of investigation of the malfeasances connected with road-building contracts in Quebec on which the prime minister of that time from liberals, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly burst.
"Dyusheno's report" established direct connection between the industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Since the investigation beginning in 2010, he emphasizes, one only the Ministry of transport would keep billion dollars on contracts" if some constrained the instincts to take a share.
Charbonneau's commission "already displaced two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will manage "to open the schemes standing behind individuals".
Constant division on the fight against corruption, created in 2011
The Constant division created in 2011 was connected to business on fight against corruption which structure included the extensive staff of governmental auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, besides, the staff of special division "Hammer" who after 2009 forced "waste cartel" Montreal to stop overestimate of cost of contracts.
For the last weeks a series of searches, and to some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Rishar Marcotte - the mayor of the small town was made, accusations of fraud and corruption were brought.
On turn - Giles Vayankur who has recently retired from a post of mayor Laval, the third largest city of the Province of Quebec.
It suspect of numerous receiving bribes at placement of the state orders.
Besides, official accusation was brought to several engineers of service of means of communication of Montreal and construction contractors of the Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito.
The last blew up the real bomb, having told to a consequence about "system" of obtaining the state contracts.
Within several years Zambito gave 3% from the cost of the contracts signed in Montreal, to the certain intermediary connected with a mafia who, in turn, transferred money of party of mayor Géralde Trambl "United Montreal".
In the 2000th years Zambito squandered money to the right and on the left. He transferred more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to various parties of the province, generally to the liberals who were then in power.
Besides, he admitted that illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from Natali Normando's Liberal party.
Sewer contracts in which overestimated cost
In Montreal "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Giles Syurprenan, the former civil engineering engineer, in details described it before the commission: in ten years he received from civil engineering firms of gifts, invitations in trips, on tournaments on golf, in restaurants, and bribes in total for 736 000 dollars in exchange for the sewer contracts, which cost it overestimated by hockey matches.
Other officials responsible for a construction of roads, admitted that received on a paw, overestimating accounts by 30-40% by means of false additions.
Then one organizer from party of the mayor, Marten Dyumon, accused Mr. to Trambl that it intentionally closed eyes to existence of the parallel budget filling party cash desks with dirty money.
After these revelations Mr. to Trambl retired at the beginning of November, having shipped Montreal in deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal, sounded the alarm.
The mayor of the district of Rivyer-de-Preri in the east of the island, it resists since 2010 to sale of the municipal site bought for 5 million dollars and resold for... 1,6 million to builders at the height of construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in investigation which finally will be begun, she "will pull for a thread, allowing to understand the system functioning, teeming with ants to stop gangrene and to define guilty".
It characterizes this process as "painful, but positive".
We are in process of wound cleaning, but own investigation team and the observer will be necessary for Montreal to avoid return doubtful the practician.
As we are moved away houses.
Regularly.
Jacques Dyusheno notices for its part that "officials stole hundreds millions dollars", but especially he is disturbed by a role of "the elective officials knowing about this scheme", but not participating in frauds.
Considering that the share of dirty money in financing of election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, it jokes: "I was told that it was only pale reflection of reality".
The government of Quebec suggests to limit to 100 dollars of a donation to parties, but, according to him, it won't change a situation: "While we will strictly not limit elective expenses, in policy there will be dirty money".
He demands full reorganization of system of providing the state contracts and financing of parties: "We can't fall below; having safely penetrated into an essence of things, we will be able to build the house on stronger base, with the best control and legality".
If this history also casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dyusheno calls those who laughs, to glance in own yard...

"PSG - not FC Barcelona!"
In this season you in PSG achieved unusual scope.
How you explain this growth?
It can be explained with individual consciousness, but can - and new measurement of PSG.
There arrived great players.
Near them I grow every day.
The technicians also introduced a lot of things.
These factors force me to lift level of my game daily.
And during a match, it is simpler.
In soccer everything occurs very quickly.
But I don't burn.
From the very beginning in the center of preliminary preparation in NIF in Klerfonten and before my arrival to Saint-Etienne I always walked forward.
Thus, you benefit by the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
To replenishment of this summer not to play matches of very high level a novelty.
They know also that each training is very important.
It leads to that such player as I, thirst to be up to standard and give all the best to the maximum.
Besides, Carlo Anchelotti gives support in my positioning.
It is helped by such deputies, as Claude Makelele who played in the same position, as I.
Anchelotti - a master of the situation?
Certainly.
Anchelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today in the First League to it isn't present equal and it is included into number of the best trainers of Europe.
It has an extensive experience, and he won many titles with high quality clubs.
It worked with great players.
I think, it will bring new titles to Paris.
In January I with it had an encouraging conversation.
Then I departed from the whole series of traumas.
The trust which it renders to me, also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of a season of PSG?
In the First League Lyon took away from us a place of the leader.
But we still on call.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we were effectively qualified in the one eighth ending.
What purpose of club in this tournament?
We will try to pass as it is possible further.
From now on everything can be.
We will be able to tell the word face to face with very good European teams.
We at first want to finish the first in our group, before Porto to have opportunity to accept a return match in the one eighth ending.
Whether there will be able to be a PSG the first-class European club in short-term prospect?
It for this purpose already has a budget...
To become large European club, Paris needs to win titles and to fix positions on long-term prospect.
Today it not so.
Financially the PSG have means to make this project real.
Not to take a title in the First League how in last season, will be a big failure?
Certainly, it would be big disappointment.
This year we valid hotly wish to catch this champion title.
In last season we were close to it.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish the first.
It was very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points are assumed by a rank of the champion.
But other team, Monpelye, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think, everything will be as it should be.
In spite of the fact that fight for a title was entered by such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have forces to win.
Whether you think, what mass media wait too many from PSG?
It is normal that from us expect much, considering, how many was enclosed and what players at us.
We completely are ready to it.
On the other hand, when we win houses 4-0 against Troyes and us nevertheless find for what to scarify, certainly, it upsets a little.
We ask a question that waited first of all from us by people.
We never will be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.
We not FC Barcelona!
We try to introduce the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can answer modern calls.
Look at Manchester United to which already two seasons don't manage to be passed in the one eighth ending though they too spent huge money!
Considering the enclosed sums, we represented you on 15 points ahead already to a winter break.
It would be neglect to our opponents and to the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille which weren't on the ball in last season, were "woken" by this new PSG.
It shows, the First League is how fascinating.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all difficulties, as a result we won.
The PSG, apparently, completely depends on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's feats.
Well and that if say that there is certain "Zlatanozavisimost".
It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores many goals.
It came for this purpose and it proves that it a star of the First League.
Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he is the great player and a global star.
In group we respect it as the person and as player.
He too respects people who surround it.
That it made, it is valid only.
It stimulates also others to improve the game.
Tyago Silva who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How you endured Euro-2012 from French national team?
As disappointment.
I hotly wished to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me to snatch a little game time.
I saw there many things, and I left from there stronger.
Today I manage to play good elimination games.
It that, on what I hoped from the moment of my baptism at Blue.
We learned lessons from this that happened in Ukraine, and now have to behave is exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deshama at the head of Blue?
They for it are productive.
It has good positions in selection group to the World Cup.
He is the strict trainer, it is close with players and inspires on a victory.
What was Laurent Blan.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blan achieved the object, he qualified us in Euro.
I hope that Didier Desham will bring Blue into Brazil.
The good deserved draw (1-1) which has been pulled out on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us a self-confidence.
Everyone battled for all.
To this shock in Spain, in my career there were no similar matches.

To pay and sell without the aid of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete antithesis to the current monetary exchange based on the Central Banks, the numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commission collecting on their processing.
Besides, as often there is to these technologies, obviously political vision: belief that the present currency system consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
Actually, Bitcoin, the invented Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), at the same time is virtual currency (but converted in dollars, euro... ) and the protected protocol of an exchange as BitTorrent which allows to carry out file exchange between participants of one level.
About 200 000 operations were already registered from 15 000 computers in a network.
Some thousand sites accept биткойны for implementation of donations or as means of payment.
Course биткойна, having reached a maximum in 30 dollars (23 euros) in the June, 2011, five months later I fell to 2 dollars before coming back today approximately to ten dollars (courses are specified on a site bitcoincharts.com).
Anything special in comparison with a world exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in the report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
It describes биткойн as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with dollar or euro" and "similar to usual currencies".
Bitkoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as utilized for advance in video game who are earned in the course of game or which are possible for buying (and sometimes and to exchange "credits").
The social network Facebook also developed similar system.
But exchange operations always supervises and processes any central body.
In Bitkoyn all knots of a network are at the same time holders of the account book, auditors, issuers of currency, pokupately and sellers.
How this network functions?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment the user can choose other address, providing thus anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction, is signed elektronno, with use of system of enciphering with a double key.
The network also can check authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to file contents, it is possible to check that биткойны, used in the transaction, really exist in the public accounts book dispatched on all network.
Key stage is registration of new transaction in this book.
It passes through the solution of the mathematical task dispatched to computers, solved which as if the temporary central bank, receives the privilege to add this new line.
It is a question of a phase of hashing of the file, that is transformation of the big file to the digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" new transaction and add it number before "hashing" everything together.
The purpose consists in finding number which will give the unique digital signature (many zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other knots easily check that it is correct.
Transaction thus is nerarzryvno connected with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If for the purpose of deception the user very quickly (less than in ten minutes) wishes to pay two times one and to a subject the money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed with a network - and another would remain unconfirmed as they have different digital signatures.
The computer which has solved a problem, receives 50 биткойнов.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly halved probably until the end of 2012.
The number биткойнов in the address therefore is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred-million that leaves still a reserve...
Complexity of a task also increases with increase in computing power.
Network life already endured take-off and falling.
The sites rendering the services Bitcoin, were attacked, and биткойны were stolen from reserves.
"The used defect doesn't concern the protocol", - Pierre Nuaza who started recently Paymium - the company carrying out payments by real money with Bitcoin network use assures.
The European Central Bank reported also about possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But cash also possesses this shortcoming.
Large players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations such.
Others, such as WordPress blogging platform, resolve them.
Recently Adie Shamir and Dorit Ron from Weizman's Institute in Israel, analysed the accounts book and found out that nearly 80% биткойнов don't happen in a turn.
"Huge sales" were declared in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", Jón Holmkvist working in Coinabul which is engaged in converting биткойнов in gold rejoices.
Pierre Nuaza, other author of a grant on this currency, firmly trusts in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
Its system, Paytunia, is an equivalent of a credit card (in the real money) or contactless payment via the mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin for check of transactions that thus leaves cheaper.
The owner supervises the personal data better and can be anonymous thus.
The system is simple in realization for businessmen who don't need to install new devices or the software.
It is enough to report only the address which can be "photographed and distinguished" phone, Pierre Nuaza specifies, assuring that it has already thousands users.
There is the general tendency of revision of hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal.
"Before Bitcoin will be approved, will pass some time, but 2013 can become a turning point", - he predicts.
The European Central Bank in the report assumes to reconsider, by the way, the various risks which are considered today as raised, in case of success of this system.

We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French armies left the zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans have to follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army time came to return itself control over the territory, and for Afghans to choose the future, without hoping only for us.
The Afghan peasants whom we considered as terrorists suffered from us generally.
And ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, both wounded and crippled.
The taliban consists of foreign extremists, the former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also is frequent from peasants who reject presence of foreign army as it was at the USSR.
They want to protect the traditions, old and archaic even if dzhikhadist, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
Them suffer, they are helped sometimes by local insurgents, but they any more won't be as soon as the West will begin to behave more delicately.
Leaving of the French armies from base Nidzhrab which I observed from height of hills set with almond trees thanks to the French credits, passed in an order.
Escorts of trucks and armored machinery accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014 of invasion of Talibs to Kabul won't be.
Circumstances changed since their insuperable advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of fight between various groups.
The capture under country control then was perceived by them as some kind of release, return to safety.
The Afghan women paid for obscurantism of these peasants in which they were surpassed by Al-Qaeda, but their situation didn't improve and today.
The former Mujahideens, the Afghan government and present Talibs are uniform in the desire to hold women in the subordinated situation.
The main characters of anti-Soviet war returned to the power in 2001.
They turned into the businessmen seizing the state lands to resell them under building to the repatriates who have come back from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American contracts of a subcontract.
They are discredited; the majority of them, by the way, even weren't at war.
People as I heard in rural areas, want the government which would consist not of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who managed the American generosity will leave: outflow of the capitals is considerable.
Young people were tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its advantages.
About 65% of the population are in age till 25 years; in Kabul 5 million inhabitants, the one fifth general population now are.
Public schools in the cities are filled, both boys, and girls.
It is necessary to provide with workplaces of these young people which won't want to come back neither to obscurantism of old parties, nor to corruption of some heads.
Everything, including the armed fighters, love mobile phones, television and the Turkish soap operas which represent the modern world and which look everywhere.
At the moment the army is.
The authorities which will order it, whether will be considered as the legitimate?
The old commanders conducting anti-Soviet fight, already take measures to restoration of provincial teams which wouldn't submit to the central power.
Afghanistan, highland, with strong local distinctions, has to be decentralized to a certain degree, on a sample of the western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into the centralized state with the strong presidential power, eliminating a post of the prime minister which existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai doesn't want foreign control, in particular before the elections planned for April, 2014.
But its country, since 50th years, and even earlier, depends on the foreign help.
The industry wasn't put on the feet, any dam doesn't function, any irrigational system isn't repaired.
Everything is imported; it is made nothing, except vegetables and fruit.
The priority is given to a private initiative.
In the country destroyed on thirty years of war, the state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
Hearings went that Afghanistan possesses huge mineral riches.
It only strengthened feeling that the western countries were present there, only that to take control of them.
Without energy for processing of iron ore or copper on a place, out-of-pocket transportation that to export them through mountains, isn't present mining.
Chinese already almost left a field of copper of Month Aynak, having left the international archeologists (financed World bank) to dig out a huge Buddhist complex and to remain the largest employers of the province.
It is necessary also that one fine day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan on which in big degree import and export depend, restored the normal relations.
The conclusion of the French fighting divisions came to the end on November 20.
The new contract on cooperation provides preservation of the traditional help: lyceum for girls, for boys, French faculty at university, the French institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support of archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 in aspiration "to win hearts and minds" and to carry out an impossible problem of combination of the help with offensive operations, service "military and civil activity" at the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with small French public organization, promoted numerous public works and the activity directed on recovery of agriculture in tens mountain settlements.
These works, with intensive attraction of local labor, could help to constrain revolt: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of the woods, fruit trees, protection of soils and increase in the area of arable lands.
What will we leave for memory of, having spent two billion euro for military expenses?
Much more modest budget would promote improvement of living conditions of local population, very severe in these valleys located often at the height more than 2 000 meters above sea level.
The embassy received tens written requests for implementation of the small agricultural works proceeding from local communities in the province of Kapis.
To get rid of the revolts directed by foreign groups that wished by farmers as they spoke to me, it is necessary to give to them small not military support which would well be supervised and would arrive to them directly.

Difficult confinement of the Constitution of Egypt
It is a new risky step of president Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the constitutional declaration which temporarily confers it emergency powers, it decided to go for broke.
Having taken all unawares, he declared on Wednesday that the Constituent assembly will vote in the final text next day.
Exactly a week ago the head of state provided to Meeting two additional months to finish work.
Soon two years as Egypt is guided by the preliminary text to which amendments were several times made that weakens institutional stability and conducts to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only strengthened country division.
According to his opponents, the President persists in the "autocratic nonsense", continuing "to break this word" and "to violate the right".
Of camp of his followers are sure that it is a way to finish institutional and political crisis, having accelerated transient.
The referendum has to be held within fifteen days.
Very short period of time which forces Brothers to refuse intention to explain to Egyptians the text, article behind article.
For the president it also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy while the discontent storms over all country.
Mohammed Morsi, apparently, is convinced that Egyptians will vote positively as he declared in one interview to the American Time weekly.
Especially as the appeal to the accelerated vote resembles the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I leave to myself emergency powers" which as it is supposed, have to come to the end after adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent assembly, generally Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
The majority of liberals didn't respond to a call.
In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they left in a huff, feeling the opinion isn't able to inform.
Representatives of defenders of human rights, religious minority or civil society made the same.
That the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hasty added yesterday in the morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No wonder that in most cases articles were проголосованы unanimously.
Commentators were amused, by the way, by that fact that one of the few disagreements of day arose around... time for a prayer as some members of the committee considered that hours of the Constituent assembly were incorrectly adjusted.
The text in which yesterday still there was a vote, consists of 234 articles.
Object of general attention, article 2 finally remained to identical article from the Constitution of 1971 saying that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of the right".
Salafistsky parties for which introduction of the Islamic right is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules" that would give the chance of their more strict application.
For Islamists that fact that this article wasn't changed, is the sign of their good will and respect for other participants of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", - liberals who see in it only public relations answer.
Because, in their opinion, Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220 which grants to university Al-Azkhar an advisory role, in particular, in that, as for check of compliance of laws to Sharia.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sofie Pomye, it causes alarm since "the people, urged to make decisions, aren't elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can observe theocracy origin".
Many liberals are besides excited by the fact that the following rector of this university, seemingly, will be much less moderate, than present.
"At the moment there is no concrete religious intervention.
With this constitution we remain within civil law.
The majority of lawyers who worked over this text, is not ulama, and people with the university education, some were trained in the French system" - Alexis Bloye who prepares the thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition calms.
But he recognizes that "round article 220 there can be an ambiguity as the terms used in it are borrowed from religious lexicon.
It belongs in particular to "fikh" [Islamic law, - primas of an edition].
And in the future there can be a question, how civil judges are competent to pass decisions on it".
Besides the religious aspect, the text accepted yesterday, is exposed to criticism as it confers large powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they were considerably reduced in comparison with what were at an old regime.
Other disputed issue: powers of army.
According to wishes of military, consideration of the defensive budget will take place not in Parliament, and in National council of defense.
Also the trial of civilians in warships, despite requests of associations on protection of human rights won't be forbidden.
The last also expressed concern concerning the text which they consider pernicious for freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy is kept, and the insult that can have serious consequences for a freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press from now on is forbidden.
Besides, any of articles any more doesn't speak about protection of the woman, Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch emphasizes.
According to her, the only positive moment shows a ban of tortures in article 36.
The word which didn't appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to act last night on television, demonstrations are planned today in the second half of day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, come to streets on Saturday.

In Israel the Ukrainian tourists are waited by holy sites, the Center of the universe and the sea from a brine
The promised land unites greatness of bible truth, modern comfort and a nature pervozdannost.
"AIF" allocated five most important reasons for which it is necessary to visit Israel.
Let's bow to holy sites
It is worth visiting at the Jordan River in which there was крещен Jesus.
It is considered that on all who comes into this "font", the God's good fortune condescends.
And Galilee - a place of miracles of Jesus: transformations at a water wedding in wine, circulations on water, calms of a storm and filling of networks.
Here Jesus was before pupils and after revival.
But most of all shrines in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Way of Grief or Jesus God Way (on Latin - Via Doloroza).
It begins at fortress Antonija - Pretoriuma, - where there was a court, and on streets of the Old City brings into the Temple of the Lord's Coffin on the Mount Golgotha - to the Crucifixion place, the Stone of the Unction and a place of burial of Jesus.
There is the symbolical Christian Center of the universe symbolizing rescue of mankind.
And a monastery of the Sacred Cross in Jerusalem will erect on a place where, on a Christian legend, the tree of which made a cross for Jesus crucifixion grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy site for Jews - the Wailing Wall which has remained from the temple, destroyed by Romans in 70 g AD.
By tradition people of different confessions leave here notes with desires which are granted then.
To make travel down
Ruins of fortress of Massad remained from a secret shelter from enemies which the Tyrant Great constructed in 25 g BC for the family.
They are located on steep rocks in mountains at the height of 450 m over ocean level.
And those who is fond of mountaineering can reach to them under the own steam only.
The others to this historical top are delivered by the elevator on a ropeway.
And in the north of the country at the height of 1600-2040 m there is Hermon's well-known ski resort, on which in winter months - huge flow of tourists.
To it from the bottom of the mountain delivers the bus shuttle.
The general extent of mountain-skiing routes makes 45 km.
According to the ancient legend, at mountain top allegedly there lived pagan gods.
To visit unique museums
In this country about 300 museums.
For one trip to all you won't visit.
But at least five of them which are most interesting, it is worth visiting.
Among them - the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
The most ancient Kumransky manuscripts, or the rolls of the Dead Sea found in caves of the Judaic desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits are stored in it.
It is worth visiting and the Museum of arts in Tel Aviv.
Cloths of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely presented to his expositions.
In Akko it is possible to visit Al Bash's representing some halls of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bathhouse attendants of that time the museum ban.
In Caesarea it is worth coming into a unique private Museum of Rally where it is possible to admire Distance and Rodin sculptures.
There are no guides and souvenir benches.
Entrance free, and donations categorically aren't accepted.
The fifth - the Museum of the Holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - is constructed in memory about 1,5 million destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers of children.
You come into it - and it appear in utter darkness.
Stars flicker.
Also names of Jewish children and the name of the countries in which they were lost sound.
Ukraine there too is mentioned.
To get healthy
Three main resort zones of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead seas.
On each of them there are pools, aquaparks, delphinariums and oceanariums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea swim even in winter months as water temperature there doesn't fall lower than 21 degrees of heat, and air gets warm to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and there bathe all the year round.
By the way, this most unusual sea is in the world on the lowest point of a planet - 417 m lower than ocean level.
Azure water in it - a brine which is easily holding afloat even not able not to float.
Landscapes around it is unreal are beautiful.
Go here to receive medical treatment with application of salty water - brines, and curative dirt and to treat health at dermatitis, allergies, asthmas, eczemas, arthritises, bronchitis, diabetes to order the reeled nerves.
To touch secrets of an antiquity
They are stored by ancient part of Tel Aviv - the small town of Jaffa on the bank of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it I passed the well-known Sea way connecting Egypt, Syria, to Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in Ancient Greek and Ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legends, exactly here Ache constructed the ark, and Persey rescued beauty Andromeda with whom here they lived long and happy life.
Tourists very much like to wander on the very narrow small streets called in honor of zodiac signs.
Speak if you touch walls on the street of "the" sign, the Fate becomes favorable.
In Jaffa it is possible to meet the newlyweds coming from all Israel and even of other countries on a photoshoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of the tsar of the Tyrant - it is possible to wander on the Roman theater, "to take" the fortress of crusaders.
During the Roman period Caesarea was the main town of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
Carefully restored theater now is used for evening concerts and opera performances.
To the tourist on a note
Going to Israel, don't worry about the imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know Russian.
In a trip it is better to take money not in euro, and in dollars which are easy for exchanging for shekels (now 1 dollars - 3,8 shekels).
The city transport - generally buses, but in Jerusalem is the high-speed tram, and in Haifa - only in the country the line of the subway consisting of six stations and connecting Nizhny the city with Top.
In fact, it is an underground cable car.
Journey in all types of city transport costs 6 shekels for which it is possible to go with changes within 1,5 hours.
In Israel by Judaic tradition on Saturday note шабат.
Since evening of Friday to sunset on Saturday the markets, shops, public transport stop work.
And on Sunday since morning working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and a dish in which are combined milk with meat.
There offer a wide choice of dishes from mutton and beef, soups and the desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste хумус, various sauces, balls from ground нута - фалалель, fruit and vegetables.
On streets of the Israeli cities there are no vagrant dogs.
But there are a lot of fattened cats who it is impressive "walk in itself".
In the evening they can be seen sleeping even on roofs of the parked cars.
Murlyki is loved by crowded places and don't refuse a food.
Car rent, depending on brand, will cost from 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus an insurance - 15 dollars a day.
And hire of the bicycle will manage in 15 cheeks. in day.
Tickets in museums cost an average on 30 shekels.
Language of figures
In 2012 Israel was visited by over three million tourists from all over the world.
Most of all to travel and have a rest came citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The Promised land from January to October, 2012 was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists that is 51% more than a similar indicator of 2010, before cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.

"Great and mighty" to Moscow will bring: migrants save money for language
While deputies and human rights activists argue that will give the law on obligatory language testing, in the country already there were the swindlers trading in "phony" certificates
Annually to Moscow, Petersburg and other cities of Russia there come 13 million guest workers.
Mostly it is citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose - to earn money for maintenance of the families which have remained in the homeland.
Since December 1 the law according to which each labor migrant will be obliged to pass examination for knowledge of Russian came into force.
While this rule works only for those who intends to work in a services sector, housing and communal services, a life and retail trade.
However over time, - promise in FMS, - tests become obligatory for all visitors.
Besides it is necessary to hand over not only language, but also the Russian history, and legislation bases.
The knowledge of language should be confirmed both for receiving, and for work permit extension.
The exception works only for citizens of those countries where Russian is a state language.
Don't fall under action of the law and the people, in time to receive certificates and diplomas about education before disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Advantage, hopelessness and protection of the rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of Institute of Russian of a name of Pushkin, University of friendship of the people, the Moscow State University, St.Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Migrants will be able to hand over tests in all cities; already now in Russia more than 160 such centers opened.
The initiative about introduction of testing supported both deputies of the State Duma, and FMS.
And here human rights activists before the law came into force, many times managed to ask a question in the press: and what it, actually, will give?
What will change obligation of knowledge of language both for Russians, and for visitors?
First of all, - representatives of migratory service answer, is will allow to reduce number of the people suffering from "labor slavery".
The very many speak now about protection of the rights of labor migrants, the head of representation of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev explains.
Protection of their rights has to begin before their departure.
Only the system of the organized set will allow to solve problems of foreign workers for 90%.
Problems appear at migrants without a profession, the education, not knowing the language, not having physical examination.
Without understanding of language, - Sebelev is sure, - future migrant is doomed to face unfair people who under the guise of the help will put to it "permit" in a terrible close barrack where it and tens to it similar for months will pine without food and documents, sticking for 12-14 hours per day.
We receive a set of complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland to them promise one, and on arrival them deceive, select passports, don't pay the promised salary", - the chief of Head department of labor migration of MS of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov confirms.
Don't swear, a nasyalnik!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics gathering for earnings to Russia, admit that not only don't know language of the country to which aspire, but also on the own write hardly.
Certainly, it not so much their wine, how many trouble: the few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks are able to afford to get even a sensible primary education.
After all at their families there is nothing even to feed children, without speaking about that decently to dress them, to put and equip in school.
Growing to teenage age, such children at the first opportunity go on earnings.
It is difficult if it is bad with knowledge of language, - they admit.
"You feel small also defective".
However, concerning the law on language human rights activists note one important point.
Testing will be held only for those migrants who have the legal status.
If the status isn't present - won't be neither examination, nor the subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, the most part of guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or the Stranger the entrance is prohibited"
Many of visitors claim that not so simply to receive the official status in our country.
The reason - in bureaucratic obstacles and the same language difficulties.
Besides, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And here false registration can be made quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
Staff of the Russian police knows that we have generally false documents, there is no registration, from here and extortion cases.
"Ask one hundred, two on cigarettes, tea", - the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Hushkadamov shared with journalists.
"Fly, don't stint, buy painting"
In the first day of coming into effect of the law on language it became clear that false happen not only migrantsky documents on registration.
Some "phony" certificates on passing of language tests are already withdrawn by employees of FMS.
Counterfeit papers are printed on the ordinary color printer.
Certainly, new owners got them not for nothing: each of the migrants hoping thus to facilitate to a problem of passing of tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
It is more than two times more expensive than procedure of official testing: it will cost to the labor migrant three thousand.
In that the main task on the near future - to protect system from corruption that "crusts" couldn't be bought simply, meet both authorities, and human rights activists.
While the authorities can promise to the guest workers who haven't managed successfully to pass test from the first, time for studying of a basic language course.
Besides, to the visitors who aren't knowing the Russian, work in the spheres which aren't assuming active communication with people will be offered.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs doesn't take in hand the illegal market of the weapon
The share of crimes with use of the legal weapon is smallest
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia suggests to toughen the law concerning owners of the civil weapon.
It is reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To press shots at weddings when did without victims, and a massacre staged by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov as a result of which to Press seven people were lost.
Police officers want to forbid carrying травматики in public places and to increase age from which it is possible to obtain the license for the weapon - from 18 to 21 year.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee of safety and corruption counteraction Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments in the law on the weapon will make to the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities try to deal with the problem by "crackdown".
In a network there was the open letter which authors - representatives of the different public shooting organizations - demand to refuse "senseless toughening".
The hooliganism percent with the registered weapon is minimum, lawyer-criminalist Vasily Lesnikov declared to the Russian BBC service.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in six months 2012 142 crimes with application of the firearms registered in law-enforcement bodies whereas all for the same period 1168 thousand crimes are recorded are committed.
Authors of the open letter are sure that legislation toughening in the sphere of the civil weapon doesn't place to the criminal to go on the "black" market.
Now, according to them, it is possible to find any weapon in Moscow at the low price.
Meanwhile in the Ministry of Internal Affairs claim that supervise a situation with distribution of the illegal weapon.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The "black" market of the weapon replenishes on several channels.
The main such channels five, the colonel in resignation Victor Baranets, ten years worked in structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff tells.
Screenshot of the site accepting orders for the weapon
The first - "an army or military trace", that is the weapon which was stolen during operations in the Caucasus.
"The weapon dragged both the Russian officers, and Caucasians", - Baranets speaks.
The following look of "the black weapon" - stolen by criminals at representatives of power structures.
Baranets explains that here enter and carried away from police warehouses, and stolen from directly law enforcement officers.
Illegal "trunks" go to sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses often there were explosions.
"There are proved versions that part of arsons were made specially - to cover shortage", - the former military speaks.
The contribution, according to Barants, producers of the weapon bring.
"Now private small-arms factories which don't maintain the competition in the international market propagate and throw out the weapon covertly on the black market, including Moscow", - the expert tells.
One more source of the "black" market - smuggling.
Especially arrives guns and machine guns from the poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan much.
"There is the production, sometimes handicraft, and the mafia which organized a stream" was formed, - the former military explains.
From where weapon?
Experts counted, what approximate share of each of sources of deliveries of the illegal weapon on the "black" market.
The report on it in 2011 prepared the Center of the problem analysis and state and administrative design.
Experts analysed the reporting of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapon subject.
Overwhelming part of the illegal weapon, researchers write, arrives from army and power departments.
A half of all weapon in the black market appeared there "because of officials, whose work is connected with the weapon", is spoken in the report.
According to researchers, 17% of cases the weapon arrives from places of armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there are plunders at a weapon production phase, 5% are the share of "black archeology".
The selling assistant of one of the weapon shops, asked not to call its surname, assures that the weapon found black diggers, for a long time nobody buys - is too old.
Most often, as he speaks, behind new party sellers go on a military warehouse.
Through the ensign of people buys unit, for example the gun TT.
To it write out it, transfer through a zaborchik.
"It transports it to the city and here sells for 900 euros apiece with two shops", - he tells
"However, the police in a course of all affairs therefore periodically when the plan on solvability of crimes burns, carries out control purchase at dealers in the illegal weapon", - the consultant adds.
"As in magnificent shop"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked on sites, in blogs, the companion who suggested to arrive on the Running platform where there will be a person who will take away me in "corner" where we will bargain didn't respond yet.
I learned the trunk price only there
military observer Victor Baranets
To get a trunk the acquaintance who has an exit is necessary to me, - the selling assistant tells. - I have such acquaintance, but I am not confident in him.
Sellers in the markets are, but there too it is necessary to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich who asked to tell that at the daughter tooth dropped out".
I now even get couple of brass knuckles through the person in whom it is confident.
It too delivers them only to me because knows that I won't hand over it.
Beginners look for the weapon different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tested as the buyer of the illegal weapon in the mid-nineties when prepared for the publication article about it.
Schemes, according to him, didn't change.
It was given an album with photos where was "anything".
"I felt as in magnificent shop", - the military remembers.
To the buyer, according to Barants, don't offer a pig in a poke - everything can be tried.
I, the potential client, not simply buy - we go with the seller to the wood, there we put a target.
"To me give the chance to shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon beats well, we start bargaining", - the expert describes procedure.
Shop on a sofa
Searchers on the Internet bring to sites and groups in "VKontakte" where suggest to buy the weapon "for the different purposes".
For this purpose no documents and personal meetings are necessary.
"It is enough to have a certain sum of money", - write in an advertizing cap on a site "Buy a Service Pistol or the Machine Gun".
On it users leave the demands and ask questions.
And to minors will sell?
"Without the license certainly", - user "Ivan" (the spelling is kept) asks.
"I will buy Vol. Moscow" - laconically formulates inquiry "Fedorenkov".
The federal security service now разбросила a huge network of false sites and wishing to buy the fighting weapon rows with a shovel.
People go as hungry fish on bait, and then extract in Siberia coal
military observer and former military Victor Baranets
I heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside action of the Russian laws.
People accept orders.
The buyer via the ATM pays.
"In reply send the photo and the instruction where the weapon" is hidden, - the press secretary of public organization "Right to the Weapon" Dmitry Kislov tells.
Victor Baranets claims that having left the demand on a site, it is possible to remain without the weapon and to get for a lattice.
The federal security service now разбросила a huge network of false sites and wishing to buy the fighting weapon rows with a shovel.
"People go as hungry fish on bait, and then extract in Siberia coal", - he claims.
Makarov for 100 dollars
Upon purchase of illegal small arms, according to the experts, it is possible to keep within the sum from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the Right to the Weapon organization, Makarov's gun can be got for 100-300 dollars.
It is necessary to wait month - one and a half.
It is shipped from warehouses of long storage by the management of these warehouses of an average link.
On official стастистике departments, in comparison with January - October, 2011 the number of such crimes as a whole across Russia was reduced by 7% and made 22,9 thousand, and the quantity of the elicited facts of plunder and extortion of the weapon, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7,8%.

In the USA workers of fast food and supermarkets strike
Through work on cash desk "McDonald's" passes to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days across America the wave of protest actions against low wages in department stores of Walmart corporation and restaurants of popular networks of a fast food, such as "McDonald's", "A burger King", "Tako Bell", "Uendis" and "Kentucky фрайд чикен" swept.
While nobody undertakes to predict, whether this wave will turn into the highest wave or she is fated to exhaust at early stages.
Actions support labor unions and a number of the left public organizations.
Except increase of modest wages which are got by ordinary workers of Walmart and system of a fast food, the purpose of organizers of protests is creation in them the trade-union organizations.
While this sector of economy isn't captured almost by trade-union movement.
46 cents a year?
Actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, in so-called "Black Friday" when the orgy of the cheap sales which has taken million inhabitants and sometimes accompanied fights fell upon America.
This day some employees of Walmart corporation in which 2,2 million people worldwide work, left the workplaces and picketed together with labor unions and the left activists corporation shops, whose goods are calculated on people of modest and average prosperity.
Walmart trades in everything on light, from diapers, hunting guns and automobile batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its shops are on the average from 8% to 27% cheaper, than in large supermarkets.
Therefore many low-paid workers of Walmart do shopping only at themselves at work.
Availability and the range of goods made Walmart of one of the largest corporations of America.
According to critics, Walmart is able to afford to sell goods to a podeshevka partly because pays to the workers a little.
The last also complain of severe conditions of work, for example, on shortage of auto-loaders or manual scanners.
Participants of actions on "Black Friday" demanded to raise a salary and complained that the cost of the medical insurance provided by corporation, jumped up with 30 to 100 dollars a month.
It is too expensive for the typical worker of Walmart receiving 9,5 dollars at an o'clock, this expense, they spoke.
Scientists from the Californian university in Berkeley prove that if Walmart will raise a srednuy salary to 12 dollars at an o'clock, it will cost corporations 3,2 billion dollars.
It is about 1,1% more, than it spends for a salary now.
If Walmart entirely shifts growth of salaries to shoulders of buyers, each visit to shop will manage them only 46 cents more expensively.
In a year they will spend for any 12,39 dollars more, than now.
Supporters of Walmart note enough that protest actions happened in only nine states and didn't put corporation the slightest damage.
"Black Friday" proceeded in its shops from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 goods in a second.
In total its cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The representative of corporation Dan Fogelman claimed in interview to the left site Huffington Post that workplaces were left in total by "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that protest action was only "the next PR trick" labor union which has organized it.
"Free cash desk!"
Protests proceeded this week in New York where not Walmart department stores (them in this progressive city were their object don't favor and therefore they here while aren't present), and "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
The McDonald's says that it sells billion portions and after that it at all doesn't give you sick-lists and doesn't pay to you for honest work!
Dzhumeyn Williams, member of the City Council of New York
At present the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York legislation, makes 7,25 dollars in hour.
Restaurants of a fast food raise it over time, but not much more, and on the average their ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars in hour.
Less they in this expensive city aren't earned by anybody.
As it is possible to exist in New York on such money, for me it is incomprehensible.
Once through "McDonald's" passed almost a quarter of the American teenagers who earned additionally behind their counters after school, living thus at parents.
Very few people saw in it the main source of livelihood or planned to be late there for a long time.
Now I constantly encounter interview to employees of "McDonald's" who complain that have to live for this salary and sometimes even feed on it children.
On the other hand, at a forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper the comment which author notices hangs that irresponsibly to bring children if you don't know, on what you will feed them.
Participants of protest actions who began in 6.30 mornings on Thursday at "McDonald's" on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue, demanded that at least 15 dollars at an o'clock started paying to cashiers and cooks of system of a fast food, that is more than doubled their present minimum earnings.
They also demanded that in the sphere of a fast food the trade-union organizations were created.
The American law forbids administration to it to interfere and to punish activists of trade-union movement by cavils and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration seldom facilitates them life.
But it is difficult to capture labor union a fast food and for the objective reasons.
One of the main - unusual turnover of staff.
The discordant
Noisy protests took place this day and at some other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of an action was in the middle of the day meeting at "McDonald's" near Times Square on which some local democrat politicians, in particular, the member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams who has declared acted: "McDonald's" says that it sells billion portions and after that it at all doesn't give you sick-lists and doesn't pay to you for honest work! ".
Demonstrators were supported also by other prominent New York democrats, for example, the candidate for a post of the mayor Bill De Blasio who has declared that "we have to enter amicably support of workers of a fast food they achieved fair payment and economic wellbeing which is deserved by each New Yorker! ".
As characterized New York Times event, it was the largest action such in the history of the American sphere of a fast food.
But some hundred people participated in it, besides not all from them were workers of a fast public catering in which in New York tens of thousands of people are occupied.
While it isn't clear, whether this spark will generate a flame of a grass-roots movement.

"While to deceive a brain it turns out so-so"
Popular among admirers of modern technologies the augmented reality subject can be perceived recently generally through a prism of special glasses.
At first in the summer at the annual conference Google showed the working model, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent was submitted also by Microsoft.
However from conversation with the head of group interactive 3D - technologies in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharamom Izadi follows that for scientists of this company points - the passable stage.
They accept prospect of manipulation with virtual objects in air barehanded, creations of virtual open spaces.
- Tell, please, in general, than your research group is engaged?
- We are engaged in interaction of the person with cars, but thus we try to move apart borders of this interaction.
While the mankind in weight got stuck at a work stage with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes tykanye in them a finger.
We want to glance for 5-10 years forward and to foresee cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the prefix of Xbox and sensors of Kinect is a step forward, and almost any Xbox without Kinect isn't on sale today, after all everything interestingly sign management.
- What for us waits ahead?
- In spite of the fact that Kinect transferred interaction to physical level, a lot of things still occur on the flat screen, sometimes in the 3D.
Input of information improved (the system obtains more data), and a conclusion yet very much.
We try to change it, we work over truly three-dimensional systems of display on the basis of various technologies, including projective.
It is necessary to let out the computer world in our, physical, to make it more tangible.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to distinguish not only the user, but also space round it.
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell these foolish helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice-activated control?
Popular piece, but whether overestimate it?
- Definitely it is impossible to call it panacea - there is a privacy question because not always there is a wish to inform people around on the actions and intentions.
Actually all types of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in the niche.
For example, for management of devices in public places we had a project within which we thought over gestures, but not over wide, and over such avaricious, short.
Thus gestures were removed not the device camera, and a wrist bracelet which fixed movements of bones and muscles.
While it big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a watch.
But in general the future behind the mixed type of management, for example, жест+голос.
- It as?
- For example, how you ask me to transfer you this to aerated water bank?
You will tell and at the same time you will show.
- I usually simply speak.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to be distinguished.
- That is you want to force users to adapt under what can or the car can't at present?
- Absolutely optional, but this mutual rapprochement.
I think, soon we generally should work over development of new types of sensors which will allow to define more precisely than reaction of the person.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give quite good permission on depth, it is very important.
- If to speak about your work with sensors of Xbox Kinect, what claims at you to modern cameras?
There is no permission, depth or still something?
- In principle the present generation is from what it is possible to make a start in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Certainly, it is good to receive megapixels 8 with a speed of 1000 fps.
But it isn't megapixels, and as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view all present technologies for us are insufficiently good is adds works to designers of algorithms.
That is it is necessary to remember not only about permission on axes X and Y, but also Z.
Also the speed, number of frames per second is very important.
Movements of the person are quite dynamic, and present 30 fps is frankly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes made a contact sensor of our Redmondsky laboratory with an adjustable delay of processing - from 1 to 100 ms, and modern serial sensors are closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not all understand as far as it influences interaction of the person and cars.
In my work the equivalent of such device which only isn't demanding contacts that frames per second was more very would be useful to me.
- And the number of cameras doesn't need to be increased?
- In Kinect now there are three "cameras", one of which actually - an infrared radiator, and the second - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And here already the third camera is, actually, usual sensor of visible range.
It isn't applied to determination of depth of object.
Potentially bigger number of cameras could solve a problem...
Or to aggravate it, having increased the demanded volume of calculations.
It would be quite good to create flexible analog of Kinect, to be played with curvature of an arrangement of cameras and to look as it will help with three-dimensional definition of situation.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, I didn't present to public the points.
It doesn't seem to you, what from the point of view of daily use of technologies of augmented reality points are one of the most perspective platforms?
- Certainly, all the time to walk about, holding the smartphone in the raised hands, not so conveniently, but here that I think: the "passing" augmented reality when on the basis of a cloudy platform you could switch over from points to the smartphone, the projective display and further everywhere would be the most cool option.
Points - very personal device, in it their force (private things you see only), and at the same time weakness - the augmented reality on the basis of points won't allow you to work over virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's present for a minute that the manipulation virtual holographic objects in air is available not only to Tony Stark from "Iron Man", but also to the mere mortal.
There is one problem to which critics of such idea often point: there is no tactile response!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers your group prepares on this call?
- In the lectures I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh break in interaction of the person and the car.
I think, the additive of tactile feelings can quite become the eighth.
While one of interesting tricks - use of the second hand as a peculiar substrate for the image.
It perfectly registers pressing!
But there are also technologies which are really directed on giving here to these "to pictures in air" to tangibility - for example, an interference of several directed ultrasonic beams in a certain point where there is a finger, gives feeling but while it very weak - as though to you blew on small pillows.
There are also bracelets on wrists which influence the nervous terminations in fingers - too the perspective direction.
- And you tried to deceive a brain?
To force it to think that he feels what, it seems, has to feel while he sees something?
- Here it is good idea, we yet didn't try to do so.
Here one more task with which it is necessary to struggle for a long time - how to force the person who is physically in very limited space is covered to believe that he goes on open, almost infinite - is worked and over concepts of racetracks (not so such, as in clubs), moving platforms, and also huge spheres.
While to deceive a brain it turns out so-so, works still very much for many years.
Here that does work on so attractive virtual reality for the researcher - many things in absolutely rudimentary condition.

Vkusovshchina instead of culture - to Rosbalt.Ra
"Росбалт" continues the Petersburg Vanguard project devoted to citizens who are ahead, in vanguard of culture and art.
Bright figures of an art scene of Petersburg already got to this top list, whose achievements are beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, passing the All-Russian popularity.
New hero "Rosbalta" - scandalous artist Kirill Miller.
All city knows Kirill Miller - the bearded person dressed in all red, which that meets at the Russian museum, at the Summer garden, on fashionable parties and opening days.
Kirill Miller's pictures always collect crowds of the audience where they wouldn't be exposed.
Kirill Miller - one of especially Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers, founders of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright person of the Petersburg vanguard of the end of the 80th - the beginning of the 90th.
Besides, he is the person of the city, the emergence on streets raising a smile at the citizens, lightening all mood.
Recently he took a street organ in hand and became the Petersburg organ-grinder as ripened for this difficult role all the bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill and why you after all go around the city in all red, instead of in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red color as the fashion designer who is engaged in a look and image.
In this world red color is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.
Though in society everything that slightly not gray, causes aggression and excitement of bad property.
But my provocations are directed on that conversation began.
All history of my provocative stocks - the invitation to discussion.
- And when you understood, what has to be the artist?
- At an exhibition in a recreation center Nevsky where my works were exposed.
I understood that it is my way.
Then the wave of old free informal artists passed, and new, free like me were unclear.
I began to be on friendly terms with artists of a new wave, with a postgazonevshchina which brought to "Pushkin-10", and more wave wasn't.
Me throws into theater, clothes, music, into all genres, except the word.
- And all this united in your Art clinic... - It was important to me to come to be in the center of culture of Petersburg where all best creative power has to gather.
In 1995 I occupied the territory on Pushkin-10, and there, yet there was no repair, there was a musical and artistic club, bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemia.
Many there were born: NOMY, Tequila jazz, I remember how Cord brought with the Van Gogh's Ear project.
Cord and its friends lip-synched easy songs, they were in fitting body stockings, among them there was fashionable nowadays composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group played alive, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was the host of many programs till hali-galivsky times.
We gave them Trakhtenberg, and his great career, and basic education and education he at us went received.
The D 137 gallery, club "Griboedov is echoes from Art clinic.
There our workers and frequenters left.
I am the hero of a yesterday's eyelid when the culture something meant.
In 2000 poll was in the press, the award was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of Year" I was called, my culmination came to an end.
In new times by old rules it is uncomfortable to work, I am the person of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are shared, it is possible to be popular, but not so cultural.
- The recognizable manner is inherent in your works.
- My many pictures are hits, in them pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I will have a program exhibition, "The Russian museum in clowns".
Clowns - timeless category.
I social was earlier, now to be such it is sick and terrible.
But in clowns everything is smeared, the tragic element is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, world rescue by totalitarian disguise in the form of an order.
Now on clothes meet, being guided by external mechanics, instead of by the internal person.
And, maybe, he can't offer a hand and in an ugly face it is necessary to spit.
And deception will be removed by means of disguise.
- And recently we saw you as the city organ-grinder. - The cultural city has to have such hero.
To whom as not me, to be it.
- Well can and commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art has to be accurate, tactful, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
Earlier people got off in packs, the bohemia loved one, gawks another.
Now all broke into microcommunities, now difficult it will be pleasant to all.
I am not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to be pleasant.
Now it is necessary to think it will be pleasant to whom.
Now at each cult hero on 100 admirers.
- And to Stas Mikhaylov comes on some thousands!
- Broshenka come to it, there the sekso-social sphere works.
And on the cultural soil of 300 people will come, and 10 thousand won't come, and as a result there is less than management, money, everything withers.
I have admirers, the main thing - them not to deceive, not to spoil the sewed.
I wrote such pictures to youth that one collector has them on a wall near Falk and Larionov hung.
I began with pictures with which usually finish.
Now often confuse concepts.
Speak: culture spiritual, culture of consumption.
There is no culture at consumption, it quite another thing.
I am the person of culture of yesterday, grew on examples of artists which lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of drawing of pictures.
I for such here culture.
- Kirill that doesn't suffice to Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such concept: the official from culture.
But not each of them can be engaged in culture.
At the correct tsars everything not so was, tsars, maybe, not so understood in culture, but they understood that it is necessary to keep the correct experts.
Here in Moscow now good consultants.
We in Petersburg have people which could be experts, but they are pushed as higher experts who will correctly estimate these experts are necessary and will let them pass.
Now the vkusovshchinka prospers.
The same Erarta, but distinguishes them that they honestly speak what not we accept all modern art, there are such artists who have to look for to myself other museums.
- What is for you - Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital, in Moscow cultures much more, there the soil is.
And on our stones to art raise difficult.
The cultural soil is necessary to us, and we now have more than writers, than readers, it is wrong.
Here in Europe there are a lot of people curious. which go on exhibitions, concerts.
At us this layer is thin.
We need to make fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is realized on means of a grant of St. Petersburg

To give rise in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid murderer.
Caravans of spaceships with people of Earth onboard go on searches of a spare planet.
To keep mankind, there is a main issue how to continue the sort in the conditions of zero gravity or on the same spare planet?
I think that the choice is insignificant.
Actually real planets only two which can be mastered at least hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars", - the senior research associate of the State astronomical institute of a name of P.K.Shternberg (GAISh) Vladimir Surdin considers.
But if on Mars conditions more suitable for life, on a surface of Venus - temperature of 500 degrees.
It is possible to live only at big height or in an orbit of Venus... in space.
Started approaching to reproduction questions in space from flora.
Half a century more made experiments on plants back.
Four generations of the peas grown up in an orbit differed nothing from the terrestrial grades.
Then - removal in an orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies drosophilas.
In 1979 to space sent eggs of quails to check how the embryo in the conditions of zero gravity develops.
We receive at the exit of absolutely normal baby bird.
And here the problem further begins.
"A problem connected by that this baby bird has to find a support, he has to get up on the legs and start moving", - the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medicobiological Problems (IMP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev explains.
Without having found a support, baby birds randomly somersaulted.
And in 10 hours newborns had a full atrophy of instincts.
Baby birds didn't react to light and a sound.
And there the trouble was that in four days they simply perished.
"And two times we вылупляли baby birds after that refused because it is simply impossible to work there with them", - state an experiment failure with baby birds in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals the last time biological "miniark" flied into an orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However on the Bion biosatellite there will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats who were sent to space already with a fruit.
In principle, there didn't find anything supernatural.
"It just was on biosatellites, but besides is a single experiment, and such researches should be conducted", - Vladimir Sychev notes.
After a landing space rats had a posterity.
But to approach to a reproduction problem directly in space it doesn't turn out yet.
Difficult task.
Animals, losing, habitual habitat, can't simply realize the sexual instinct.
The person, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons similar experiments aren't made.
But women fly to space 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious that the mankind has, is a female organism.
Our Seagull departed, and anybody on Earth couldn't tell: whether it will remain after flight in space.
Whether she will manage to give birth to the child after that flight.
"After all nobody answered this question", - the veteran of space-rocket branch Vakhtang Vachnadze speaks.
In June, 1964, all in a year after flight in space, the first female astronaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to the daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan Nikolaev also was an astronaut.
In 1988 at the second female astronaut Svetlana Savitskoy who twice has visited an orbit and even worked in outer space, the son was born.
However the risk remains.
We haven't enough, units is astronauts at whom after long flights everything managed, and the healthy generation grows.
"And if it is more, it is dangerous even at orbital flights", - the space pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hera Rossii Valery Polyakov sums up.
And still, the mankind needs to look for any new ways in biotechnologies, protection against radiation, creation of artificial gravitation.
TsPK hydrolaboratory - an obligatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here in the conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts fulfill skills of work in an outer space.
Water imitates zero gravity.
If for adults water, let and comfortable, but after all the alien environment, for babies - native elements.
Small ихтиандры as if confirm - life on a land left the ocean.
There is a communication meanwhile that the kid is about 9 months at mother in okoplodny liquid, it is easier to it to get used then to a water.
In principle it is logical because from the birth moment, from the moment of that first bathing, passes only 2 weeks.
"It isn't enough that something to forget", - the instructor of grudnichkovy swimming Marina Aksenova speaks.
In a word, if for the been born child zero gravity more natural state, - is necessary for the woman gravitation, gravity.
Very quickly in zero gravity muscles of a stomach, a basin grow decrepit, ability to fruit pushing out falls.
Well it is fine, we will lower also it, relying on stimulators of patrimonial activity.
It is possible to go, of course, in the special camera on childbirth, it will push out it.
"And further that? " - Valery Polyakov asks uncommon questions.
On the other hand, artificial gravitation too is necessary to the child.
Without feeling terrestrial gravitation, the organism won't create a skeleton and muscular system.
The newborn in an orbit it is impossible as adult, to dress in a special load suit for trainings.
It will be simply deprived of that to it will be vital.
"And this experiment on which we will go, having allowed the birth of the child in the alien environment, will lead to that we will bring to Earth of the disabled person, completely deadapted person", - the head of committee on bioethics of IMBP Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestov expects.
While the birth of children in space - a theory question.
However, later time it will be reality when people of Earth by the ships will go on a far-out planet which becomes the house for their descendants born in space.

In branch of government procurements the Czech Republic has good control authorities and, despite existence of the qualitative legislation, lags behind in its application.
Miroslav Kala's this statement, the vice-president of the Supreme control and auditing management, from interview for a site Aktuáln ě. cz.
"The law never will be ideal, but it has to be applied correctly that, in my opinion, at us doesn't suffice", - commented on Kal's current situation.
The similar conclusions are provided by joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
As an example of the wrong practice give Peter Nechas's approach to so-called Schwarz system.
Recently the prime minister declared, what CDP (Civil Democratic Party) won't disturb businessmen checks - there is it it is forbidden or it is authorized?
"The law should be somehow established, and if it forbids something, and the prime minister can't resist to work of establishments to which it is imputed a duty to check and achieve implementation of obligations", - Kala states.
At meeting of auditing committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German parties within which the legislation on government procurements of both countries was compared.
About what specifically there was a speech?
Parallel check which we began, likely, two years ago means.
In other words, speech that the European legislation claims how have to pass government procurements, follows further the national legislation and then also application in practice.
All information was collected and, even at even incomplete check, interesting distinctions - in other words were found, we can have a legislation "exact and faultless", however in practice of application we on some parameters concede to Germany.
It follows from this that it isn't enough to create more and more specified rules, it is necessary to concentrate on application of the law.
And actually as this project can help you, what it means to you?
Such joint control can make a contribution to efforts on a stop of specification of laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions because it doesn't lead to positive result.
The economy means receiving the corresponding thing for reasonable (but not always low) the price to avoid enrichment and, probably, criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will reach it, having reduced restriction of orders.
Probably, this system will be overflowed with "papers" so that those who will wish to find openings in this system, will find them much easier than if restriction didn't decrease.
You speak about internal problems of practical application of the legislation on government procurements.
And how the monitoring system in Germany functions?
Whether there is there such organization as our CAM (Control and Auditing Management) or it works differently?
As for establishments, there Bundesrechnungshof arranged by our principle acts as our CREWE, also there is a board working a few in a different way, but generally both establishments function similarly.
Besides, powers to a certain degree are similar but as Germany has federal structure, there are divisions of audit and at the level of federal lands - in it their system differs from ours a little.
BRH can operate only federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are supervised at the level of federal Audit Chambers.
As for the local legislation, there it is simpler, than at us?
In general, I wouldn't want to compare without concrete data, but in certain respects Germany can be imitated, but it is impossible to tell definitely that it is better in everything.
It so because they cope with control better?
Definitely not, but I will repeat, similar comparisons aren't pleasant to me.
But it is necessary to tell, what even the model countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any advantage from cooperation with our office, truly?
If to speak about the domestic legislation how were reflected in your establishment of the amendment to the Law on government procurements, consequences are somehow shown?
Considering that validity of these amendments is quite short, it still wasn't shown in any way in our works on control.
As we carry out control upon, it is necessary to consider some delay.
We take it into account only in the course of preparation of future checks - we started using our new tool "detection of risk of not economy" via which we banished nearly 14000 state contracts. We analysed them. There, of course, these changes will be shown because restrictions change, conditions of some types of tenders and so on change.
How you consider, the adoption of this law will benefit or additional load of bureaucracy system?
I think that this law, certainly, a step in the correct direction, and, I hope, it will be confirmed.
Problem which can arise, such is that rules "will become tougher" and they can't be observed.
When functioning the previous rules the controlled enterprises are tied with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on government procurements means violation of the budgetary discipline.
Whether it is worth toughening in that case the law in such a way?
I think, what not this way.
The system has to exclude those who wants to take and abuse, but not to punish those who makes the formal mistake which isn't influencing the decision.
Such system only will create still the bigger pressure upon bureaucracy.
And whereas to leave this situation?
Let's realize that this way anywhere won't bring.
Recently the prime minister declared that GDP Schwarz system won't disturb businessmen checks so-called. What does it mean?
"Schwarz system" it is forbidden or resolved?
The law should be somehow established, and if it forbids something, and the prime minister can't resist to work of bodies to which it is imputed a duty to check and achieve implementation of obligations.
One might say: "We will change this law and we will resolve it", but it is impossible to say that we will pretend to be as if occurs nothing.
The law on government procurements contains quite strict rules as well as that has to be carried out formally, and it is correct. It will protect government procurements.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law never will be ideal, but it has to be applied correctly that, in my opinion, at us doesn't suffice.

Are expensive in places slippery, but are generally passable.

Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to save up positive energy
That do you think what less than in a month there has to come a doomsday?
It only one of many disturbing news on which we, people, so easily come across.
Together with The Tap Tap group we constantly joke on this subject and we say that we - the only group in the world which will be able to collect rather positive energy to delay or prevent a doomsday.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against a doomsday.
You could is more detailed to tell about it to readers?
It is a question of national action for fund raising which we plan here within two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential which the calendar Maya about which end it is declared on December 21 at 11:10 possesses.
A day before this event, on December 20th at 21:00 in parallel start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, while on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean which time zone at 12 o'clock earlier, than at us, will come to the end a May calendar.
To whom did this idea come to mind?
Initially it was my idea, further all of us thought out together with our artist Hansa Augusta.
Besides that we want to save up rather positive energy and to prevent a doomsday, we also want to think together with the public over in what condition we will give once this world to our children.
On the occasion of the termination of a May calendar we created a unique collection of subjects from footwear, t-shirts, bags and original keys against a doomsday. These things can be bought on a site www.e-tap.cz and by that at the same time to give to us support.
The The Tap Tap group together with other musicians also executed the anthem against a doomsday which the doomsday is called "Is cancelled".
Whether YouTube already fallen in love to listeners the anthem at these benefit performance concerts will sound?
Certainly, right at the end, if as a result everything turns out and the doomsday won't come.
It will be started singing by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
Anthems at the same time will begin to sound also on the air of the Czech television.
Words to this song Tomash Ganak wrote and played Jesus role in the clip, participates performed by also Xindl X...
How you started cooperating with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of the Czech cultural life as we hold many charitable events and concerts.
We try to connect them to these projects actively.
It appeared that much like to work with us, it is interesting to them.
On what the proceeds from a concert against a doomsday will go?
We so work for purchase of the equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year with the civil association Tap at Edlichka's institute.
Teachers regularly visit students of schools of institute of Edlichka and hold with them cheerful and interesting events.
Students have no means to go to teachers, and we try to give them this opportunity thus.
Within the project of additional construction of institute of Edlichka in the future there will be separately a building to which we will move with this project.
At each concert will make a speech some musical groups and performers.
What selection criteria were?
We tried to make the program which will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, as Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dang Bart, The Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Jerzy Sukhi will act.
About all details it is possible to learn on a site www.kpks.cz.
Whether you any similar plan "grandiose actions" in the future?
In May we will speak for the first time at the Prague Spring festival and here, of course, we will prepare the interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we with pleasure would carry out representation in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, if we will be in the USA, very much would like to act in Washington and Chicago.
About the abroad at you serious plans, you already acted in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The The Tap Tap group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics? ?
It isn't so terrible as it seems at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their carriages have to travel in a luggage compartment, plus to everything a large number of freight and boxes with tools.
Nevertheless, while coped with it without problems. The Czech airlines Č SA and the British airlines of British Airways always excellently for us were prepared that me how many time surprised.
Even in Moscow, from where we returned recently, everything passed without problems.
Thanks to departures abroad you can compare the different countries from the point of view of availability, the attitude of the public towards disabled people and so on.
What you faced by the present moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything functions better, than at us, in Russia we became witnesses of that in the east still is at a basic level.
In comparison with Prague in Moscow there are a lot of barriers, and here in wonder independent movement of the person on an electric wheelchair in the downtown still is.
Also there not in a course such banal things how to give way to the disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there already there are public organizations which try to pay attention of people to problems of people with limited opportunities.
And in what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are many things, which level of execution far behind.
But it is important to specify that situation improvement always depends on efforts of those people whom it concerns.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with a heavy form of disability independently move on streets, can descend in a toilet, in a museum and anywhere...
There that a large number of people with limited opportunities we take active part in public life, in it them with The Tap Tap a little isn't so widespread we advance!
The respect of the public or accessibility is an one thing, but at the moment when among us there will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything indeed will start changing.
While it is isolated cases - strong-willed persons.
The The Tap Tap group is very popular now, but we will return for two years back, what in 1998 you forced it to organize?
I entered Edlichka's institute as the tutor, round me there were many young people who wanted to be engaged in something.
And as I am the musician and I play including a saxophone, together with the colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, and over time, as our leader Ladya Angelovich speaks, it got out of hand (laughs) a little.
Popularity came only in recent years, or I confuse something?
It is the truth, we were helped by that we started joining the well-known singers and actively to work over group promotion.
We came to a conclusion that work which nobody can estimate, in fact as though doesn't exist.
Thanks to means of the European union we are able to afford the qualified teachers, the equipment and so on.
Whether there was you a purpose so well to untwist The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning I felt their potential in ability to make something unusual.
In Show business it is full of the things, imitating one another.
It is logical, all new is accepted with care, and it lasts long.
There are very few rare things, but I will dare to tell that Tap Tap one of them.
The first impression at the person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural...
But this pity is absolutely excessive because people with limited opportunities aren't any suffering and all thrown persons for whom we have to feel sorry.
They are people who can live full-fledged life and develop, of course, only provided that they possess necessary resources.
I say that if at people with disability something turns out, it is shift not only for them, but also for all society.
Whether provided success what you the strict head as what you are considered by many?
If we want to do work qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and hold a certain discipline.
But I consider that it is normal.
Some people to us come with romantic representation and fly in clouds and when learn that two times a week they have to go on rehearsal, attend training courses and spend much time on the way, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But so occurs in any group which wants to work and something to reach.
Now as a part of The Tap Tap group twenty people.
How many they were at the beginning in 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovich.
We open group, people come and leave, it can't be prevented.
For who has desire and will power, our doors are always open.
It will take place a day before an expected doomsday, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba stadium, in Brno - in Fléda club and Ostrava - in the Plynojem center with participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
In concert end all three cities connect a teleconference at the time of performance of the song of The Tap Tap "The Doomsday Is Cancelled" group.
The purpose of this project - to raise financial funds of 25 million kroner for purchase of the multipurpose barrier-free equipment for the educational center STUDEO at Edlichka's institute in Prague.
The ticket for a concert costs 400 kroner, for children till 12 years an entrance free. Tickets can be bought in advance in Bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at meeting of ministers of the European space agency Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European space agency as the second country from the countries of the former east block (after the Czech Republic which became the full member of EKA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with EKA in 1994 and within the next years took active part in a number of projects of agency.
But to space Poland began a way much earlier.
Even before World War II the Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but it not always met understanding.
I will remind, for example, of lecture of A.Shternfeld who presented on December 6, 1933 in the Warsaw astronomical observatory of idea from the innovative work "Introduction to astronautics".
Ideas of the young engineer (1905) left audience indifferent, after several years Shternfeld remembered that only doctor Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France Shternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri and André Luisa Hirsh's award for "Introduction in astronautics".
Doctor Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966) about whom it was spoken above, became the great propagandist of astronomy and astronautics later.
It published in the Polish magazines of one hundred articles and wrote a number of the books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky I became the known world propagandist of astronautics, and his contribution was estimated including that one of craters on a reverse side of the Moon was called in his honor.
In 1925 in Poland the railway section car equipped with the rocket engine was constructed.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained is unknown, as well as project details.
Not it is clear even, for dispersal or for braking of the cart the rocket had to be used.
Information on this section car is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933 the Polish artillery started reflecting on rocket arrows.
Research was carried out by Section of equipment of arms at cooperation with professors Mieczyslaw Volfka and Gustav Mokzhitskim.
From the remained materials it is visible that researches reached a stage of practical tests.
But with arrival of the German armies of work were interrupted.
In 1937 in the specialized press there was an idea of the photo-electric rocket fighter which was offered by the engineer Rogozinsky, and next year there was a work "The air rocket torpedo and the aviation rocket bomb" the author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotsky.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war by all projects of military use of rocketry the Interim scientific and advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated all work was engaged.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of the activity work ended because of the war beginning.
The following scientific work devoted to astronautics, appeared in the Polish press after war, thanks to work of the Polish society of astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time society it is mentioned in November issue of 1954 of the Problemy magazine in which four volume articles on astronautics are published.
In one of them professor of M. Subotovich suggested to organize society which will go in for astronautics.
At that time already projects of artificial satellites grew, and it was clear that space researches - perspective branch.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish society of astronautics (PSA) tried to enter the international federation of astronautics (based in 1951), and in the fall of POA became her full member.
And next year the first chairman of POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the vice-chairman of the International federation of astronautics.
At this position it remained to the most death which came in 1959.
Since 1956 of POA made the significant contribution to development of very successful meteorological RM rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) which became the first Polish rocket which has executed scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was complete in 1957, and the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable to overcome distance of 1800 m, was in length about 80 cm, and its weight made less than 5 kg.
Subsequently the advanced RM-1A version was constructed, and in the summer of 1959 on the Bledovsky waste ground tests of the two-level RM-2 rocket were carried out.
This rocket was in length about 1,4 m, and its weight made about 11,5 kg.
The following version of the rocket was already able to be engaged in the real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could overcome 14,5 km, and supervision over a high-rise wind was its task.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period between 1962 and 1965 became the successor of the first RM rockets.
The rocket was conceived as two-level, its total length made 510 cm, and initial weight - 32,5 kg.
Three types (designated as the Meteor-1А, - 1B and - 1C) which differed with the camera size for the scientific equipment were developed.
The Meteor-1А rocket had space of 0,4 l, the Meteor-1В - 0,34 l, and the Meteor-1С - 0,62л.
The maximum range of flight all three types had 37 km.
During the period between 1965 and 1968 in Aviation institute there took place development of the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October, 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was capable to bring a payload weighing 10 kg to height about 60 km.
Then Meteor-2Н versions and the Meteor-3 were constructed.
It is worth mentioning also the entry of Poland in KOSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and KOSPAR national committee creation by two years later.
Besides, within the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space researches on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second Vladimir Remek's interkosmonavty ambassador.

Cancellation of the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week the constitutional court cancelled the law on public works.
The resolution caused brisk discussion in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this perspective from broader point of view.
Liberal the focused economic systems in EU, also as well as in the globalized world, are founded on the principle of the multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In effect it means that separate economic divisions, national economic systems, are in the constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, nothing limited movement of the private capital together with unrestrained financial speculation.
As a result of a considerable difference in the cost of labor (salary) there is price tension.
It is necessary to understand a condition when the producer by means of delivery of cheap goods tries to stand in the economic competition to that "forces down" the cost of the competitor with the purpose to take away to itself the most part of the market and, thus, to increase own income as this concept.
In mass scale it means for the majority of businessmen or production transfer abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result unemployment in those in the countries, where labor cost, in comparison with others, high increases.
As the private capital doesn't bear any social responsibility including for the unemployment made by it, inevitable expenses of the state on social needs grow.
As a whole, the situation strengthens unwillingness of misters of businessmen to pay taxes and by that to compensate the public economic and social damage caused by them in a pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well-known that it isn't necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Inconsiderate methods of the private capital create at the level of economy of the certain states of a situation when the governments of the countries are compelled to enter the competition with each other artificially to lower social level of the population for the purpose of attraction to the country of the foreign capital.
Differently, the governments give own population on an arbitrariness to the private capital, despite social decline.
It finds the reflection first of all in current legislation changes.
The purpose is economically to force the the people to obey to dictatorship of the private capital, first of all in the field of a salary.
It works as system of economic coercion in case of long unemployment and at the same time serves as the instrument of reduction of the rights of workers in the sphere of the labor legislation.
As a result poverty level, at the same time and a difference between poor and rich raises.
In Germany some years there is a public distribution of products poor which aren't able to support itself own work.
The number of these people already comes nearer to one million.
Within increase of competitiveness of the German economy constantly there are cases when the employed people get such wages that the state has to pay extra to them that they received a living wage.
Similar scandal became known the public and in case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures practically, undoubtedly, bring in all southern states of EU besides to a condition in which the people being under pressure of catastrophic falling of the social status, are compelled or to emigrate as it was in the 19th century or to exist for a beggarly salary on society boondocks in hope that sometime the private investment capital will come to the country.
However it is asked, from where it will undertake?
If the capital comes from other EU countries, poverty to move from one country to another, or it won't come in general as the Chinese, the Hindu, the Brazilian, the Turk, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still works for a share of the European salary.
It concerns all Latin America.
The liberal theory and mass media to nausea claim that the state can't participate in the capital of own economy that the operated economy conducts to economic accident.
The private capital persistently insists that the state shouldn't interfere operating actions with economy.
Further it is necessary to answer a question, whether the private capital which now is almost operating policy and that whole state, in own selfish purposes works?
Definite answer - yes.
The proof is existence of almost all-powerful and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As result we have the hopeless situation which is showing in corruption, providing mutual benefits, in the legislation where practically everything deserves punishment, however isn't a crime.
In Germany a situation such is that the state ministries because of shortage of financial means charge development of bills to private law firms which are densely connected with the industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power proceeds not from the people as the constitution of the western type says, and from the financial and powerful groups preferring own interests.
It is obvious that liberal the focused democracy now quickly appears in such situations as it is described by Appian in the work "Crisis of the Roman Empire in Days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state breaks up for a long time, and departments are engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal receiving favor by means of stones and swords.
The bribery and corruption prospered without any ban, and люд went on elections with in advance sold voice""... decent people didn't stand at all to a position of the governor, eventually once the state for eight months remained without the consul". . "Seriously started saying that the only rescue in this awful situation is the autocracy and need of a choice of the vigorous person". Appian thought that it will be Pompeii, but Caesar who finally replaced democracy with autocracy became him.
As well as in the ancient time, in modern society own reckless interests without public interests prevail.
The private capital already in essence isn't intended for application in the public purposes.
The present result doesn't differ from the past: unprecedented decline of elite without any diligence to carry out reforms of deeper character.
Means the reason of emergence of fascist and communistic modes we have to look for in reckless liberalization of economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
Today lack of these modes and existence of democracy of liberal type can be perceived as a certain pause after which the following round is expected.
First of all that the present elite completely ignores consequences in hundreds thousands victims in the future, humanitarian and social disasters which we already now observe, along with crimes against humanity as we know it from an old and modern history is tragic.
Cancellation of the law on public works isn't the decision or, at least, not forever.
Under pressure of the competition both on international, and at national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be compelled to continue to look for ways for further decrease in social level of the population.
Thus this tendency has system character.
The decision are target political and social reforms which will allow to strengthen individual share of the state in economy, will strengthen a role of citizens in government and will weaken a monopoly position of the private capital in society in favor of the state.

Israel: Chaos laboratory.

"If my sons didn't want wars, they wouldn't be" - dying Gutel Shnaper, Meer Amshela Rothschild wife.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, caused a set of responses.
One play for Israel, reasoning its position that it has the right to self-defense, and Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, reasoning it is racism of the Israeli state, the genocide made over the Palestinian Arabs, and to the state of Israel the role of the terrorist state is attributed.
I don't want to reflect on the one who in these periodically repeating waves of murders - the criminal and who the victim, eventually, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governed territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and weren't witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My purpose is to suggest readers to glance for a curtain, to look at the one to whom first of all 95 years lasting already tension (considering from signing of the Declaration of Balfur in November, 1917) on a small ground of the Middle East serve.
My some reasonings are buttressed up historic by facts, some of them are brought on the basis of my own understanding of the one who or what group of people is the main engine of events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first of all race for power history.
We can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon in every era.
That isn't so clear - whether always these people absolutely independently took the steps, or behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions to in advance planned purposes.
It is necessary to assume that we live during the period when the world wealth is concentrated in hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from them couldn't occur for life of one generation.
One which could be considered as the head of an octopus (I don't know, whether there is someone over them, but it isn't excluded) is distinguished from astronomically rich families - Rotshilda.
About them don't write much.
Certainly.
The first news agency (Рейтерс) they bought already in the nineties the 19th centuries to stop the hearings connecting their name with criminal actions in the highest spheres in which shadow they were and which always conducted to strengthening of their power, enhancement of wealth or at the same time both to that, and to another.
They have large equity stakes almost in all central banks of the world, and against the countries, in whose central banks they have no the share, they wage or prepare war (before invasion into Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after invasion into Iraq there were 5 countries, after overthrow of Gaddafi remained only four, however at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of the country in hand).
Any who tried to resist to this family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of the central bank behind Rotshildovsky Bank of America, during civil war it started letting out own (understand - governmental) money and it was killed in 1865 at theater.
John F. Kennedy started issuing own money and wanted to cancel FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis Makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to file a lawsuit against FED for an unbinding of the Great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst of the world power during the period from 1859 to 1871 led to development of the plan of three world wars created by the great mason of the 33rd level by Albert Paykom.
Destruction of the monarchic states in Europe was a problem of the first war, the second had to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third has to lead to reduction of the world population approximately to 0,5-1 billion people (such number of slaves will be enough for ensuring their comfort and luxury, and they won't consume many resources), to creation of uniform universal religion (the ekumenizm can't be anything other, except as the precondition for such project) and to final capture of the absolute power.
Method by means of which the group of the richest families led by Rotshildami works, the call of crisis and the subsequent offer of decisions (order ab chao - an order from chaos) is.
But these decisions are false and always conduct to situation deterioration (see the basis of FED which had to prevent repetition of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to launch World War I by means of murder of the Habsburg successor of an Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand to Sarajevo, they destroyed imperial Russia, having begun a Bolshevist revolyutsiiya.
World War I ended sudden, unreasonable in the military and economic relation with capitulation of Germany (any more there was no need of war for destruction of imperial Russia) and, as a result, there was a smashing of the Central European power, Austro-Hungary.
For simplification of an unbinding of World War II bankers and politicians created the hidden conflict situation, having imposed on Germany huge military reparations, than created the precondition to radicalization of impoverished masses, then it was necessary to throw only to Germans rather strong, convicting guilty and the Leader proposing simple solutions, further to create multinational Czechoslovakia with strong German minority which had to play, and really played function of the fifth column, when kindling fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century of Rotshilda provoked the basis of the Zionist movement which one branch sought to create the Jewish state, it is desirable in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
Balfur's above-mentioned declaration created the precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first collisions with the local Arab population started happening.
Terrorist attacks happened from both parties.
World War II flashed, it is difficult to estimate, whether Hitler from chains in which he was kept initially by bankers, or everything escaped that he made, was planned, in any case sufferings of the European Jews in concentration camps created preconditions for recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and just as Germany was provoked by military reparations to the 2nd world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create the center of war of the third.
If the international bankers manage to untie it, the Jewish people, as well as in World War II, will fall a victim of operations on a front line, already together with Arab or, in other words, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is as if huge laboratory, a contention and chaos source not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict where the offense generates offense in an infinite chain of violence if everything began with greed of individuals and their aspiration to the world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders because, as well as at us, the international bankers palm off on people for vote on elections of exclusively own candidates.
The present prime minister of Israel Netanyahu's hawk is a typical example fascist, loyal to the international bankers the politician, doing everything to begin war with Iran, which, thanks to membership of Iran in the Shanghai organization of cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan... ) will threaten to develop into the world conflict, and considering control of Iran over the Strait of Ormuz containing 20% of all world reserves of oil (the navigable corridor makes only 2 miles wide), - also will lead to destruction of world economy.
In what light the words told by David Rockefeller in 1994 are now shown: "Everything that is necessary for us is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order".
The new world order in their representation is the world of misters and slaves.
The world where other part of human population serves a handful of the financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
The world where to each been born organism at the birth implant the chip with which it becomes a being being under total control.
"Also forces all small and big, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on the right hand or on a forehead a brand, so that the person who isn't marked with a name of that animal, or number of its name, couldn't buy sell.
Here in what wisdom: everyone who has a reason, can calculate number of an animal.
Because it corresponds to a name human, and the number is six hundred sixty six.

Movie "Operation "Slang": When worse than ever, cause Hollywood
In November, 1979 the crowd of Islamic students demonstrators seized embassy of the USA in Tehran and took hostage 52 diplomats.
They had to be released in exchange for overthrown Mohammed Reza Pekhlevi's running after revolution in the USA shah which were the patron of his mode within decades.
For administration of the USA the positive outcome of a situation wasn't assumed - she wasn't able to afford to throw out the shah for a board because it in a root could undermine trust of allies in other countries.
However to reach release of hostages in Iran where revolution led to establishment of a theocratic mode, it wasn't able.
It was the blow to prestige of the United States which was strengthened by unsuccessful attempt to release hostages force later.
The put diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations with mediation of the government of Algeria.
Their destiny caused houses a wave of solidarity and the anti-Iranian moods.
Defeat in Iran substantially promoted Jimmy Carter's defeat on the presidential election of the 1980th year which has come to the end with election of Ronald Reagan.
The movie directed by actor Ben Affleck "the Operation "Slang" describes one of episodes of that history which brought to America small victories.
Shortly before occupation of embassy six workers managed to run away.
After difficult peripetias they finished the way to residences of embassy of Canada.
CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities was succeeded to take away them from Iran, the extravagant legend of cover according to which they left according to the Canadian passports as the members of a film crew who were looking for in the country a place for shootings of the science-fiction epic thus helped.
Combination of genres
The plan which was invented by the "evacuation" expert Tony Méndez, demanded cooperation of Hollywood.
That the legend was reliable, in specialized magazines was written about the draft of the movie, press conferences were organized, the invented production company had real office.
Operation details long time were kept a secret, the movie, is based on Tony Méndez's memoirs.
Affleck movie is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, so-called "movie film opus", history of a successful invention, swindle - an example can be a number of movies about Ouchene's friends.
In the movie moods - on the one hand, documentary conceived scenes from Tehran (in credits sign historical photos of events are shown and how the same situations were shown in the movie - big distinctions in it aren't present) constantly change.
On the other hand, the facilitated Hollywood fragments which are crossing with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then still scenes from headquarters of CIA and other establishments - men in suits discuss a situation at negotiating tables, on ladders of establishments, by phone...
Ben Affleck remarkably managed to make career restart.
From the derided actor I became dear director, and his game ceased to be object of sneers.
"The operation "slang" its third feature film, after the dark detective story "Farewell, Child, Farewell" (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time it is the first movie of Affleck which isn't shot in the hometown of the director - Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of a place thus belongs to qualities which ennobled earlier movies of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in "Slang" where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes in the movie occur on streets, at reconstruction of real events - introductory scenes of falling of embassy impress with the clarity which also transfers emotions of confusion and unexpectedness which arise when somewhere the history suddenly changes.
Affleck and his colleagues reach similar effect in scenes invented (a counterfeit staff on the Teheran market).
It is too much processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with that the narration doesn't assume a set of fascinating scenes of cinema value.
It quite successfully works with this the little, sometimes something finishes thinking - there all this leaves not so elegantly (a scene in which phone call in America prevents approaching crisis at the airport of Tehran, and a pursuit on a runway look enough artificially).
Lack of "Slang" is the absent-mindedness connected with need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Gudman as the Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, however their characters would deserve bigger space, and they in the movie is far not the only.
Affleck movie doesn't have enough a little dramatic nature, it is the movie which it is possible to look with moderate interest, estimating statement and the retrostyle recreating thrillers seventieth.
But takes hardly.
However, it it is enough for a reminder on one, still in a sense live history, and also for the certificate of how ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services are exaggerated.

Rules of inflation of balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, annually interviewing about the most absurd bank collecting, decided to declare now competition on "the most absurd resolution or the project from EU workshop".
"We were moved to it by the last event in which EU plans to admit a 40 percent quota for women to administrations of the large European companies", - the organizer of a questionnaire Patrick Nager declared to "Right".
Among absurdnost already nominated on the nomination - the recent decision of the European court on association of a rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
Still women had privileges for life insurance because for insurance companies they objectively are less subject to risk.
"From EU workshop people can nominate further improbable ideas to competition until the end of this year.
Vote will take place until the end of February, 2013", - Nager told.
Disputable orders of EU treats, for example, and obligatory addition of biocomponents in fuel that as a result does harm to the nature, and also a ban on use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain rather small amount of dangerous substances, or the directive on the cage size for hens owing to what this year eggs significantly rose in price.
Also the actual ban on use of the term "sandwich-type oil" or withdrawal from sale of classical bulbs underwent criticism.
Qualitative bananas have to be 14 centimeters long.
The all-European device often passes the decision under pressure of this or that trade or industrial lobby which positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of the states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat Veta defends requirements of the banks).
Interests of a lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the superior quality in the European Union had to reach length 14 cm and didn't dare to show "abnormal curvature".
Thus the European Commission came true that only harmonizes existing separate national rules which complicated trade.
EU, despite resistance of some states, nevertheless softened the standards concerning fruit and vegetables, referring to that existing directives will lead to squandering of products.
The candidate for a prize in poll can become and the last year's resolution of EU according to which on sale balloons surely have to be supplied with the prevention that children are more younger than eight years can't inflate them without supervision of adults.
EU addressed to the American researches according to which balloons at game are a potential cause of death of children by means of asthma.
Similar restriction extends now on children till 14 years which are forbidden to blow in exhibition dudelka.
Amusing ideas are born also at home
Rather absurd is and governed, concerning European officials: everyone who has any official position in EU, can't, considering sensitivity of a subject for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and has to speak instead "BYuRM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with association of liberal economists "Principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire), offered for vote, besides several above the specified absurd rules, for example, the rule of EU about the volume of food stocks in the territory of the member state.
EU established the maximum volume of stocks of the food which can be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of tinned mushrooms, for what it was threatened by a heavy fine.
Organizers of a questionnaire were interested also also by idea to pay to some countries that they have no sea, and idea about granting subsidies for the statement for receiving subsidies.
But these ideas arose in Prague, instead of in Brussels.
"We are at a great disadvantage because we have no sea.
Let's ask the European Union about compensation", - Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas (ChSDP) of that time declared in the fall of 2004.
As argument he specified that in the country there was a big crop of grain, and as a result of so-called intervention purchases the state had full warehouses of stocks which needed to be taken out.
For that the Czech Republic is far from ports, EU, according to the Oriental carpet, had to pay to us hundreds millions euros.
As a result the European commission moved towards the Czech Republic, having organized the tender for grain purchase from the countries which have no outlet to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving a subsidy were offered villages by the Ministry of the regional development, directed by minister Pavel Nemtsem (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go on drawing up the application for subsidies of Brussels.
EU: Freakish orders are an exception
Though resolutions in member states easily become object of criticism, effort of EU on regulation, and also on more effective functioning and European Union development, according to many experts, deserve rather a recognition.
Serious problem, according to experts, the cherpaniye of grants of EU on projects which have even no hint on something the general with deepening of the European integration, however which member states achieved at budget discussion is.
Causes emotions among Czechs and that as well as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of the traditional products, and she not always wins in this competition.
Though Czechs after six years of fights with Germans and the Austrians kept the name "Olomoutsky Curd Cakes", however "Tuzemsky rum" which traditions in our country originate in 19 eyelids, our producers had to rename on "Tuzemak".
Products from reed distillate, instead of from sugar beet can be called as rum only.
In the official list of the registered products of EU, along with world famous karlovarsky crackers, a pogorzhelitsky and trshebonsky carp and zhatetsky hop appeared "feta" and "gorgondzola" cheeses, marzipan from the German Luebeck or Parma ham, already, for example.
Also pardubitsky gingerbread and gorzhitsky tubules can be proud of the trademark of EU.

People want that I preserved the republic, but I am a fan, - Okamura claims.
Mister the senator how to the person comes to mind to run for presidency?
I don't think of that most to become the senator or the president.
If at us in the country everything functioned without problems, I anywhere wouldn't stand.
But I can't look any more as for the last 20 years the country is plundered as thieves here fuss, to people raise taxes and a retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be the politician.
But when I see something that it isn't pleasant to me, I try to find the decision as to change it.
And as I already was forty years old and I am the independent person, not relating to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, except how to stand on a post of the senator or the president.
You got to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential lock.
Whether you turn thus a back to people who chose you?
I said all the time that I will join in fight for the presidential lock depending on result of elections in the Senate.
Later I specified that if I will be chosen as the senator, I will run for president.
My purpose isn't the position, the position is a tool by means of which I can carry out the views.
Therefore I need the greatest influence and the most large powers.
But difficulty not only that we as the nation grumble at ourselves in the bar or at the TV, but we are thus ready to crush everyone who will try something to change.
To it mass media which blacken the person and which confuse a freedom of speech to freedom of lie are added.
For example, about me said that I bribe journalists, or that I was Jerzy Paroubek's adviser.
Let's pass to your views.
Fight for the presidential lock you began with theses about material and criminal liability of politicians and about the return property declarations for the sum higher than twenty million.
That to carry out it, it is necessary to change the law.
At you as the president of such powers isn't present, and only the whole senate can offer laws.
How you want to solve this problem?
When I as the citizen lobbied that carrying out excursions became free business, it managed to be advanced.
The problem consists in cheap politics - when someone comes with the good offer at the left or on the right, to it deliberately obstruct, and it constrains citizens.
As the independent non-party person I have much bigger potential for receiving support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage that I without party unfolding on shelves, without thinking about doctrines can take that is the best for our country from each party and to apply it.
You consider yourselves as the person more relating to right or to left?
From the Czech point of view it seems to me that people carry me rather to the left.
For me it isn't important - a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me it is important that we went forward.
It is a question not that someone belongs to right, and someone to left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether will offer its KPChM or GDP, and I in the same way will be against bad idea.
You are angry when someone says that you the populist.
Whether but you prove it to what you told?
When you create the business plan for firm, you also have any ideal purposes and views.
And you try to come nearer to it.
It is possible to call it populism, but all offers about which I speak, already function in the world, or prominent experts speak about them.
But without parliament support you still have only slogans.
And with it in policy you long don't hold on.
Or you think, what when you will leave to people and talk to them, you will manage to realize criminal and a liability?
I have no other opportunity.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to win them over that we achieved the.
If I was elected the president, wouldn't make a problem to organize live television broadcast in which I will address to chairmen of parliamentary parties with an appeal to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to report why it don't want.
If there is a strong personality who will sound abuses, it will be possible to put pressure upon a political scene.
Take direct presidential elections are there was pressure merit from the public.
I say directly that I am a fan, instead of the genius and not the intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend the belief and views.
I only a beginner in policy, and for the program will try to get majority support.
I put I try to advance independently; in case it doesn't work well, in six years I will finish and I will return to the private sector.
It partly sounds as if Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I any not savior.
I know that one I will make nothing therefore I bypassed a number of known people with the offer to stand for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchura, he refused in connection with large volume of work.
Also I at least supported the journalist conducting investigation to Jan Lorentsov who opened fraud with light fuel oil products.
I proposed himself as a candidate because people indeed aren't satisfied, but now I feel on scales.
Sixty percent of people didn't go on elections, and the majority of those who went chose representatives of establishment.
Us independent in the Senate only two.
People chose the Senate so that changes will be carried out hardly.
Despite it, I will fight for the views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
You think of the basis of own party?
I didn't think of it yet because I have no time for checking purity of the last each potential supporter, and I have on it no money.
There is no money and for presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroner.
You have no money?
You speak about property declarations and how your own affairs with it are?
The personal property is estimated approximately at 60 million.
I have a site in Prague worth about 25 million, the apartment on 10 million, one more apartment on 8 million, a collection of works of art approximately on 10 million, Aston Martin on 3,5 million and Shkoda Superb on one million, well and some more millions on the account.
By the way Aston Martin at me appeared because it there was my boyish dream - I always liked Jaymz Bond who went by the car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You go by Aston-Martin, you own property on 60 million and you have no money for campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but own money especially in it you don't want to invest.
It isn't so convincing.
I have no 15 million on campaign.
I have to get into debt?
In campaign I enclosed already 2,5 million.
That fact that I have no sponsors, testifies that my program isn't so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for election campaign from the pocket.
Expenses on campaign to me in fact will be covered by a senatorial salary.
But on this money I wouldn't live, for example, couldn't pay to the son for English school which costs 30 thousand monthly.
If I wanted to earn only money, so anywhere wouldn't stand.
Means, further you will carry on business that it was possible to live?
Unless you didn't say, what reduce this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the salary size.
As I also promised, I partially reduced the activity.
For example, my deputy becomes the managing director of travel agency in the spring.
People would like that I was the disinterested person who will store the republic.
But I too need to live on something.
How many how the businessman, you got used to receive monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand that I receive further.
And if I became a president, the business would finish.
You will find full interview in Saturday issue of the newspaper "Right".

Architects of MVRDV prove that the real adventures happen not only in imagination - on the example of Speykenisse and his recently constructed Book mountain - 2 photos
"This building seems to me cheerful, it looks futuristichno, at last at us again it is possible to see something interesting", - speaks to Lizetta Verkhayg, prokhozhy on the edge of the road.
And Stephane Spermon, the information technology specialist at the large enterprise located nearby, considers so: "No, this building is really beautiful".
But I wonder: why to us today one more library?
All have Internet, iPad and electronic books.
Already anybody voluntary doesn't go to such old-fashioned libraries, truly?
Speykenisse, to the low-remarkable sleeping small town near Rotterdam, belongs an unusual record.
Its population numbering 80.000 people has the lowest education level in the Netherlands.
For fight against this annoying circumstance it was a few years ago decided to make a contribution to the general education and to construct seven invented bridges which are represented on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures from reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then fathers of the city understood that they still had only opportunity to overcome statistics: to construct here library!
Blame Maas from Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, the master of courageous column charts and the author witty, sometimes even cynical constructions, treated a task with the usual coolness and appeared on competitive listening in 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin on a face.
And while judges perplexedly looked back and shrugged shoulders, impudent Maas put from the original gift a piramidka by the size and finished speech in protection of the project by the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it, my offer: "The book mountain" in Speykenisse, so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later this mountain worth 30 million euros grew.
It is part of the project of a revitalization which includes also underground garage, a supermarket, mail and houses some adjoining to them and townhouses in total on 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November "The book mountain" was noted by the second award of competition "The Best Library of the Netherlands of 2012".
Also the project participates in national Dutch competition of wooden constructions of 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb which couldn't offer before anything, except a post-modernist foot zone and surprisingly ugly town hall which white facades suggest an idea of milk plant, became richer on one modern work of architecture.
But the most important - in Speykenisse appeared the public building of cultural appointment first in the history of this small town.
Long road to the book
First impression: book El Dorado under a cap for cheese.
Here only one elevator passing in the center of a massif, after all the real admirers of architecture and reading will prefer to investigate this district on foot.
The room glazed from all directions - light and easily foreseeable, floors from the burned brick and elegant streetlights unmistakably create feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is recreated ideally.
The look involuntarily looks for benches, dogs and boys playing soccer and little girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually book shelves stand along facades, and in the middle the big dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless" settles down, - speaks Blame Maas.
We put a classical configuration of space upside down and pulled out a zone for reading from within outside.
The internal space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center offices, Internet library, chess club, the ecological center and technical rooms settle down.
Especially please black book shelves which serve that as finishing of walls, parapets, a ladder handrail.
Their look, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and civil engineers guess that it for an unknown material.
"We sought to work with secondary materials", - Jop Trauborst, the project manager representing a community of Speykenisse, according to standard requirements explains.
And somehow time at one agrarian enterprise in Frislandy we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
Already there are a lot of years in greenhouses and on fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots the artificial fibrous material of millimetric thickness is applied.
It cheaply and saves time.
The thin textiles serve one-two season after that it can be thrown out.
For library this cloth - in such volumes - was pressed for the first time in the panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure so-called ландбаупластик (KLP) turns into a dark, uniform, strong material, on a smell a little reminding new car and is a little sneaker.
On top conduct 105 steps.
The one who will overcome a way nearly 500 meters long, will be rewarded in literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquets and wood ficuses in pots.
They care of the atmosphere, and first of all of the correct humidity of air on the literary mountain.
Costs of new soul
"It is difficult to believe, but this building, despite a set of glass surfaces, represents the model project in respect of ecology", - tells Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling warmth of the earth is used.
Though the Book mountain costs under a glass cap, even in clear days the sun gets inside only for a while.
Wide farms from the glued wood, located perpendicular to a glass facade, give a shadow and assume the most part of sunshine.
Climate indoors the very pleasant.
Other protection is provided by completely automatic rolled curtains.
Stephane Spermon mentioned above the skeptic from the sphere of IT, already visited new library.
To Lizetta Verkhayg also already I was here.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard who called Bukenberg "Speykenisse's soul which didn't suffice long ago".
Reason: some weeks prior to opening each inhabitant received the invitation to offer one book from own meeting.
These books had to take blank spaces on shelves yet not fully completed library - at that time in it there were 70.000 books.
The idea worked.
Regiments are crammed up to the top.
"There is nothing worse, than the thin library", - speaks the architect Blame Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation now each inhabitant is to some extent connected with this new house.
Everyone knows that its book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for ornament.
Thus, MVRDV was succeeded to solve a royal problem which on a professional slang is called identity creation.
Speykenisse wrote the literary history.
And let they are very young and uneducated.
It after all only the initial point for creation of identity.

Sabot: "Germans have to play more important role"
Germany refrained from voting about recognition of Palestine.
According to Stefen Sabo, the communications expert between the USA and Europe, arriving so, Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of a week Germany at first let know that it will vote against the demand of Palestinians for receiving the status of the observer at the United Nations.
But then Berlin refrained from voting.
Why?
Stefen Sabo: Germany doesn't support action of Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be careful in connection with its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time I consider that it also doesn't support the American position.
Germany wanted to show the independence - thus without acting is too critical in relation to Israel.
During revolt in Libya in March, 2011 Germany also refrained from voting about introduction of a prohibited zone for flights.
As a result of NATO carried out this offer.
It is difficult to Germany to take an accurate position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it so.
The matter is that it is in process of transformation of the foreign policy, namely passes from policy which, so to speak, the USA, to actually German foreign policy operated.
In addition the situation becomes complicated that Europeans have no coordinated uniform policy.
Thus, Germans again appear between two fronts.
From them it is expected that they will play more independent role, but they didn't get used to it.
I consider that while they only grope the role, but are on a way to "more normal" foreign policy.
To such foreign policy what is carried out by France or Great Britain.
What the "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view specifically means?
It is readiness to take a position which isn't depending on a position of the USA or the European partners in the national interests.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is on export and communications with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Economic interests of Germany substantially differ from interests of other large states and therefore Germany has to protect the interests.
Whether these economic interests affected a position in the Middle Eastern conflict and on vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.
Therefore she needs to show care not to offend the public and elite in the Arab countries.
In any case it plays the role.
But I wouldn't attach it too great value, it not completely unilateral communication.
But in any case it plays an important role in calculations of Germans.
Whether Germany to the relations with the USA did much harm, abstaining at adoption of important decisions, such as vote about Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the USA the understanding of the German position prevails.
Therefore I don't think that it was the same dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Probably, Germany even will get thus a certain respect.
After all it signals that it should be perceived seriously as the player on the international scene and that it is necessary to reckon with its interests.
In Europe there are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The USA, on the contrary, accurately supported the veto.
Whether there is a divergence of opinions between the USA and many European states?
Owing to the American domestic policy such distinctions existed always.
I consider that Obama's government at heart has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in connection with a local political situation the government, of course, can't openly take such position.
I believe that essential a confrontation of opinion aren't so considerable at all, as always it is represented.
If you consider the relations between Obama and prime minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama Netanyahu not so delighted with policy.
Whether easy Germany to combine the close connections with Israel and the USA on the one hand and position of the major partner in EU with another?
I think, it does a situation such difficult for Germans.
Certainly, to Germans it would be slightly simpler if there was a uniform, consistent European policy, but now it not so.
Therefore they can't act within broader approach and are compelled to work instead, relying only on own vision of a situation.
Exactly so they arrive with euro.
I think that in the future Germany will assume the leading role in development of the common European position.
It is clear that for Germany it is difficult, at least because of communications with Israel.
This subject always was ticklish.
But I think, to Germans is clear that they have to play more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as the important international player - whether it on herself will take really leading role?
Or the leading role still hard is given to Germany?
Germany didn't get used yet to it, still it is always unpleasant to it and, for the obvious reasons, still always hard is allowed to play a significant role.
Let's consider, for example, euro crisis - each time when Germany assumes an important role, the most various anti-German feelings are shown.
It isn't simple to Germans to cope with it.
Actually, it is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded with the hostile countries.
From this point of view Germany is in much more difficult situation, than the USA.
It has to take into account the most different neighbors and opinion, and it is difficult.
So, influence of the USA in the European policy constantly weakens, but at present EU doesn't fill this vacuum who then remains?
Germans simply should play more significant role.
Even if it isn't pleasant to you, unpleasantly or strengthens dislike for you - such is life!

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani - a world famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what such Armani Polo?
This name absolutely officially registered in China which has nothing in common with firms from which names it is formed.
Nevertheless it will be protected until owners of initial names won't make the claim.
But also then it isn't clear, whether it will manage to them to defend the rights.
"To foreigners everything becomes more difficult to protect the trademarks in China", - Thomas Pattlokh, the lawyer of the Taylor Wessing company specializing on violations of the rights to trademarks in the Far East speaks.
On my table every week appears on new business such.
It is enough to simulators to add only couple of letters to acquire the right to register the trademarks.
So from Gucci Lu-Gucci turns out, instead of Prada it is possible to register Prada-Kny.
By the same way the German enterprises, for example the producer of sports goods of Puma are legally copied.
The Pattlokh opens the folder with records of department of registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010 the Chinese company registered there Zegna DF Puma trademark, the artificial name in which the name of the fashionable house of Ermenegildo Zegna is used also.
That Chinese - world champions in copying and violation of intellectual property rights, is known.
In big cities there are the multystoried department stores selling almost only fakes.
However I put Pattlokh not the such. At the request of the principals he acts against the Chinese enterprises absolutely officially acquired the right to use the name which is already protected somewhere else from department of registration of trademarks.
Chinese call it "a ban минпай", brand passenger.
This word associates about "a ban дакуань".
So call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities don't recognize fault
"It causes damage to business, it is necessary to fight against it", - Pattlokh is convinced.
"The trademark is washed away, unique situation is lost, image very strongly suffers".
Financial losses and procedural expenses in affected branches are estimated in millions, especially in case of expensive copied products.
According to the company on CLSA market researches, China with sales volume of 15 billion euro a year is the third by the size and the most quickly growing sales market of luxury goods.
However difficultly to achieve removal of doubtful entries in the register of trademarks, and there is it expensively.
Process can last till nine years, with not clear outcome.
The Pattlokh tells about affairs in which the court rejected claims as after long time the protested name became "reality of the market".
If to the claimant doesn't carry, he even will have to pay to the plagiarist as caused damage to its trademark in China, Pattlokh speaks.
Sometimes here corrects the law of the jungle.
There are also well-known affairs on graphic elements.
In 2009 the Daimler company lost judicial dispute with the producer of construction Sany cars, the enterprise which shortly before that got manufacturing firm of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
Therefore Chinese have still the right to use an emblem similar to a star of Mercedes.
The Geely company which has bought Volvo originally used the blue-white logo reminding BMW; process was successful, Geely was necessary to change it.
The producer of fashionable goods of Lacoste lost in China to simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore at which the well-known crocodile looked in other party.
The Chinese authorities don't consider themselves guilty.
Department of registration of the CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that in 2010 because of shortage of the personnel and the equipment of rooms difficulties there took place.
But last year there was "a return from an emergency situation in working process to norm".
So, the number of the raw affairs on objections decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57.000 such cases were closed, is 75 percent more, than last year.
Nevertheless 81.500 claims still wait for production in department.
To fight against it costs much
As it is very frequent in China, figures impress.
Last year in CTMO more than 1,4 million statements for protection of trademarks arrived, honor one third more, than in 2010.
It is a record and means that China in the tenth time in a row headed the list of new registration around the world, reports department.
The same concerns total of the valid trademarks, only 5,5 million pieces.
In 2011 it was paid 1,8 billion yuans of collecting.
If to simplify, it means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuans or 160 euros.
It is worth protesting it many times more as shows business of the German family business Freudenberg.
On an extent more than seven years the concern fights against the Chinese plagiarist.
Germans managed to achieve that illegal production of counterfeit automobile details by it was liquidated.
However the simulator secured the Chinese rights to Freudenberg trademark.
It was own omission as surnames in Germany aren't subject to protection, Hanno Venttsler, the chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich speaks.
And department of registration of trademarks of CTMO rejected a claim of Munichites.
However, in both following instances of Freudenberg won, but the adverse party continues fight still.
It is necessary to be on the alert
Now the question is under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Venttsler hopes to bring the matter to good end and praises professionalism of vessels.
But he also speaks: "Process is extremely expensive and takes away from us a lot of time, money and nerves".
Internal expenses hardly give in to the account, the archive of firm had to see even acts of centenary prescription to provide proofs.
Five years ago Freudenberg without results offered an adverse party "the large six-place sum in euro" for settlement.
"From here it is clear as it is expensive to us costs", - Venttsler speaks.
Dangers of the Far East threaten to be thrown even to Europe.
Namely in case simulators register there for themselves unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and products from skin.
The concern stopped long ago production in these areas, but despite it could prevent registration.
"It is necessary to be on the alert", - Venttsler speaks.
As it, and the lawyer Pattlokh recommend to the German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It isn't enough to rely on world situations about protection of trademarks, rather foreigners are followed "by everything that somehow it is worth protecting, registering also in China", - Venttsler speaks.
Otherwise it can manage much more expensively, than registration.
Really: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of the trademark, will have to pay to an adverse party license charges for own name, Venttsler explains.
Otherwise us will force out from the market in a disputable segment.

World day of AIDS: притоптывать to sing, help
In Haydelberg rehearses chorus of Imbongi - and in Swaziland orphans of AIDS rejoice to it.
History of the relations which have overcome distance more than 8733 kilometers.
At first the pritopyvaniye is distributed: cowboy's boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' court shoes and man's slippers select a step on a parquet floor and quickly find it.
Raz-dva-tri-chetyre.
Only after that voices of singers - a viola, a bass slowly accrue, the tenor and a soprano - they come, fascinate and follow one after another.
And Fita Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, nearly doesn't jump out from the shoes made of cloth when conducts them flexible and expressive gestures.
Evening of Monday, in a music hall of institute of medical psychology in Haydelberg chorus of Imbongi rehearses the new song.
Fifty participants of chorus came to rehearsal from 23 to 69 years, from the specialist on genetics of the person to the yard keeper.
Obani's "Ohm"" - the difficult thing, each voice of chorus has the text, besides in absolutely alien language: Zulu on which tell eleven million people in South Africa, to Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
The help for the self-help
According to an assessment of Unaids, the United Nations program on fight against AIDS, in the world about 34 million HIV-infected are.
23,5 million from them live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland lives 245 000 orphans of AIDS.
Thus more than 40 percent of the population of HIV-are positive.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in Esitzheni's village the association Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.
70 from them attend the school preparing for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month it is possible to assume patronage.
It guarantees to the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot dinner in the Gogo-center.
Имбонги in the Zulu language the story-teller or the eulogist means.
In this hall don't speak fluently on a bow, but are able to sing.
Nearly ten years chorus study songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even brings them again there where they appeared for the first time: to the south Africa.
After all at distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Haydelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village of Esitzheni which depends on voices of the German chorus.
Forty percent are infected
There live about 2000 people some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among inhabitants there are a lot of children.
More than 300 of them remained without parents who died of virus ICh.
In Esitzheni in a miniature the illness of all Swaziland is reflected: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest in the world expected life expectancy according to UNICEF.
Trimming of an extreme flesh at men which is proved reduces risk of infection half, among the population it isn't accepted almost.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry in themselves an immunodeficiency virus, death on the middle of the fourth ten - not a rarity.
The chorus opened this village on a joint trip across Africa in the spring of 2005, but before Imbogni's participants saw a great number of children on streets to which didn't suffice not only parental care, but also it is simple in total food, clothes, education.
Without school education the person in the poor country has in general no chances.
At first it was the private obligation of certain participants - for some euro a year to send the child to school and to give the chance it of once a day to receive hot food.
But already a year later chorus I based the association "Voices for Africa" which almost professionally cares since then of orphans of AIDS in Esitzheni.
The facts about infections, sexually transmitted
What major diseases, sexually transmitted?
To bacterial STD carry syphilis, clamidiosis and a gonorrhea (gonorrhea).
Frequent virus STD are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The pubic pediculosis and itch belong to parasitic STD.
What main struck groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea meet generally at men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch institute recognizes that a minimum in four of each five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transfer results from sexual contacts between men.
At heterosexual adults often meeting diseases, sexually transmitted, hlamidiyny infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are.
HIV distribution among heterosexual adults at us rather low - however about 20 percent of new infections of HIV is the share of this group.
Among youth hlamidiyny infections meet significantly more often than among other groups of the population.
According to the European data, three quarters of all infections strike young people from 15 to 25 years.
At us among youth human papilloma virus also often meets.
How the quantity of cases of infection changes?
Not all diseases, sexually transmitted, are subject to obligatory registration.
Incidence of syphilis, according to data of Institute of Robert Koch, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The quantity of new infections of HIV since 2007 decreases.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
It approximately on the one tenth is less, than in previous year.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
At infectious diseases there can be ulcers in genitals, complaints at an urination, allocations, pains in the bottom of a stomach, and also bubbles or consolidations.
However often they aren't accompanied by pains and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How it is possible to be protected?
Condoms are capable to reduce risk of infection, but don't give absolute protection.
After all partially causative agents of diseases, sexually transmitted, can extend also by a contact infection and at close physical contact.
Therefore experts recommend regular inspection, especially at frequent change of sexual partners.
At early diagnostics it is possible to cure the majority of STD and to avoid the remote consequences.
Patronage, donations and not least the fees for performances of chorus across all Germany allow to collect something.
"All we sent to Esitzheni already about 200 000 euros", speaks to Anneta Lennartts, the chairman of association.
In the village from Germany Tsodva Dlamini, the conscious and active woman disposes of money.
She cares also of that orphans were well arranged, for example at one of grandmothers.
Гогос as call on Zulu old women, it is a village support.
Some of them accepted to themselves to 14 orphans, give them a roof over the head and care of that children in shape every day in time appeared at lessons.
At whom didn't remain native, arrive in a shelter to Haniysilya, the lonely woman who is getting paid from association, as well as two cooks who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Besides, the association "Voices for Africa" organized sewing school, constructed two hen houses and together with the American organization on health protection of PSI organized analysis delivery on HIV for many inhabitants of the village.
It is difficult to present, but about an illness which is so obvious in all country, prefer to be silent deeply.
The king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", - speaks to Anneta Lennartts, - "because it is connected with sexuality".
Quite unusually for the country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Mswati III, is known for the love to excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on such lifestyle authorized by the state the fault that virus ICh so quickly extended in last years also lies.
But it lies also on vagrant workers who carry a virus about the country.
Free condoms are literally at every turn, speaks to Anneta Lennartts, "but them almost don't use.
Other culture - a flesh to a flesh".
A little to support a cultural exchange, Ibmogni's chorus each two-three years makes a trip on the South of Africa and sings the songs full of grief, fighting spirit, confidence and black consciousness which many on South country of the black continent know since an apartheid.
The bus full white, which is sung by songs in black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and pleasure, but even, sometimes, caused tears in the face of severe frontier guards.
The trip always brings also into Esitzheni where singers visit sponsored children.
In spite of the fact that the small village hardly can be found on the card, in a valley of the river of Etsulveni it more than is known.
"Go to Esitzheni, there light", - local people speak.
And after 8733-kilometer flight back in Haydelberg when stamping singers come back to a rehearsal hall on Bergkhaymer Street, it is possible to see that this light burns as well here.

Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The probe "Messenger" found proofs of that on a planet Mercury is ice.
The ice cover can have thickness to 20 meters.
Space department of the USA of NASA proved ice existence on a planet Mercury.
Though it is located most closer to the Sun, there also there is a frozen water as appears from three researches published on Thursday in the special magazine Science.
The probe "Messenger" found proofs of that region of a planet constantly being in a shadow is covered with ice.
Its thickness has to make at least 30 centimeters, and it is possible, even to 20 meters.
Allegedly, water occurs from a comet or, probably, an asteroid, faced Mercury.
Nobody connects ice opening with life existence on a planet, the research supervisor of a probe Sean Solomon told.
Temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However these opening could help to explain how water and other construction elements of life got to other places of Solar system.
Imperceptibly for inhabitants of Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example "Phoenix", investigate Universe depths.
From time to time they send to image Earth: small windows in infinite distances.
The image arrives from the camera which was developed by the German researchers from Max Planck's Institute.
Eight planets of our Solar system, and also Tserer's dwarfish planet.
As well as Pluton which addresses round the Sun for the Neptune, Tserera, by new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, isn't "planet".
This fragment of an infrared picture of a telescope "Spitzer" represents "a family portrait" uncountable generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, it is more difficult to identify pink "newborn" stars in a star circle.
This region of a zvezdoobrazovaniye - scientists unromantically call it W5 - "Spitzer" in constellation Cassiopeia, at distance of 6500 light years is open by a telescope.
This iridescent heat of a dying star photographed NASA telescope "Spitzer".
The ring similar to a donut consists of a material which the star threw out in the course of dying.
In the huge fog Trifid removed for 5400 light years from Earth, from gas and a dust there are new stars.
NASA telescope "Spitzer" took this picture of a galactic maternity hall.
The star congestion of the Galaxy which is also called "Seven sisters", it is possible to see at night with the naked eye.
Certainly, with a telescope of color turn out better.
As the red eye winks at the observer a fog the Snail in this infrared picture.
It is located at distance of 700 light years in constellation of Aquarius.
Similarity to the terrestrial continent brought to this fog the nickname "North America".
The combination of the normal and infrared photo provides an expressive color rendition.
This new star in all beauty managed to be photographed only by means of infrared sensors of a telescope "Spitzer".
Saturn and its rings: As they arose - one of great riddles of astronomy.
Probably, it is splinters of the moon of Saturn which completely disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most accurate pictures of a telescope "Hubble": galaxy Whirlpool
Depending on a color rendition pictures of spiral galaxies turn into the real works of art.
The picture published by the European Southern observatory shows removed on some thousands light years a fog Trifid in constellation of the Sagittarius.
The name Trifid occurs from the Latin word trifidus (three-submultiple, three-separate) as dark strips of a dust divide the heated heart of a cradle of stars into three parts.
In Zmeenosts's constellation astronomers photographed a harbinger of space collision: at distance of 400 million light years from Earth of a kernel of two merging galaxies rush towards will each other and inevitably face.
Telescope "Hubble" removed this birth of a star in a spiral galaxy of M83.
The one who doesn't like technical reductions, can call it by the nickname "Southern Lantern Wheel".
The photo of a space telescope "Hubble" shows a fog fragment the Iris in Tsefey's constellation.
The fog removed for 1400 light years, consists of the dust particles which sizes are from ten to hundred times less, than at a usual house dust.
This image was made of optical and x-ray pictures of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from the black holes, removed on 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies under the name Arp 273 was photographed for NASA by a space telescope "Hubble".
Big spiral galaxy scientists call UGC 1810.
In this star fog there is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle constantly creates new stars.
This star cloud connected to a fog the Socket, also constantly creates new stars - at distance of 5000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly being shone galaxy with a small black hole still there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it arose shortly before the Big Bang when in the Universe generally there was a hydrogen.
Our views in the Universe: the major telescopes
Possibly, the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey - still before Galileo Galilei started one year supervision over stars later.
Since then mirrors of optical telescopes became more increasing - and spaces available to their look everything are deeper.
Within 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, a telescope to "Plaited white bread" in observatory Palomar under San Diego was the biggest telescope in the world.
The mirror represented here, had diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the USA, "The big binocular telescope" is established.
He allows to look in space by means of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8,4 meters.
"Gran Teleskopio Kanarias" has the huge internal device - diameter of one only mirrors makes 10,4 meters.
The mirror of "A big South African telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of depreciation.
Nevertheless in the diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
Lack of an inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened under a vertical corner is limits its mobility.
The telescope of "Hobbi-Eberli" in Texas also has the fixed vertical corner.
Its feature: high svetosobirayushchy ability.
It reaches - despite rather small diameter of a mirror - parameters of the largest world telescopes.
By means of a radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the Search of Extraterrestrial Reason project (SETI), any owner of the computer can help, having provided the computing capacity.
View of observatory of the European astronomical service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There is "Very big telescope" - completely corresponding to the name.
Its four mirrors allow to shine in a telescope even an average infrared range.
In the Chilean observatory of ESO installation European "Very big telescope" also is planned.
Its main mirror has to be stretched on the whole 42 meters - and will be made of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
However photos should be expected not earlier than 2018.
Till 2007 both telescopes "Kek" on Maun Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered the world's largest.
In them two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters are established.
Telescopes "Kek" are a part of observatory of Mauna Kea which along with them looks in the sky also by means of "Subaru" and IRTTF telescopes.
Besides, to Mauna Kea there has to be a new huge telescope - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
Here they can admire illustrations.
However the most important views from space are delivered by a space telescope "Hubble".
Since April 24, 1990 it delivers pictures of the far worlds.
Since March, 2009 a space telescope "Kepler" looks for planets outside Solar system - first of all such on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011 NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets were revealed since the mission beginning.
In the photo the last preparations of a space telescope "Kepler" are imprinted.
James Uebba's space telescope (JWST) will be sent to space not earlier than 2018 onboard the Arian 5 rocket.
The main mirror of an infrared space telescope has diameter of 6,5 meters.
One of problems of a telescope: it has to all over the world the first stars and galaxies to look for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that on the South Pole of Mercury there is an ice.
However authentic data on it aren't present as "Messenger" rotates closer to the North Pole planets.
Radar measurements for decades specified that on Mercury there is an ice.
Thanks to the probe started in 2004 "Messenger" - to the first which rotates round Mercury - scientists are sure now of it.

Drink oil every day - and live till 168 years
In the southern Azerbaijan many inhabitants reach in a bible way respectable age.
Here even there is a longevity museum.
Solution search in the country where 97-year-old aged men seem still relatively young.
In the southern Azerbaijan many inhabitants reach in a bible way respectable age.
Here even there is a longevity museum.
Solution search in the country where 97-year-old aged men seem still relatively young.
Through Talyshsky mountains it is possible to call a trip wild and romantic.
The minibus with rumble slides on the twisting road by the hills which have grown with the dense woods, rough small rivers and simple country houses.
Everything around is so green and is bright that it is possible to think as if you are in Schwarzwald.
But it is the most South country of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is in only several kilometers from here.
Here live талыши - one of the people of the Caucasus of which it is known a little, unless only that they perfectly speak on the farce and azerbayzhdansky and differ longevity.
Terminal point is Lerik.
The small town is proud of too heavy architecture of Soviet period which isn't in harmony at all with a picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come almost here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiresome.
On 323 kilometers eight hours as the road has only one strip leave.
The legendary wealth by which the country is obliged to oil of the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, didn't reach yet.
However Pilata Fatulayev (48) is convinced that to eat than interest tourists in Lerika.
"In May of Baku became famous for a song festival the Eurovision - and next year at us the festival of the oldest people of the world" will take place, - Fatulayeva speaks.
She is a director of a museum of longevity probably the only thing in the world.
Here the biography about eight dozens talyshy of these places, which is documented more than 100 years. Fatulayeva points to the black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, to him here 120 years.
At the age of 136 years he gave birth to one more child
But a disputable star of a museum is shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov to whom 168 years were allegedly executed.
Birth certificates, however, aren't present.
And taking into account that to the oldest person, whose age is documented, 122 years were executed, Myuslyumov's age is represented extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973", - Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years at him the daughter allegedly was born.
Whether shepherd Myuslyumov so added couple of tens years to the age?
After all even Rembrandt Sholts, the researcher of age from Max Planck's Institute in Rostock, heard about long-livers in Central Asia.
"Amazingly many people of old age can be met also in some regions of China, in Japan or in Hunz's valley in Pakistan", - Sholts speaks, "on Sardinia also there live very many very old people".
However due to the lack of documents scientific confirmation of age is impossible as there were no registers of a civil status.
Every day glass of drawn butter
Nevertheless there is a fact that people around Lerik amazingly often reach bible age.
Now here lives 20 people 100 years are more senior.
Why here, in the south, there are a lot of long-livers?
The Azerbaijani guide Fareed Mugimzada explains it with special genes talyshy.
The director of a museum Fatulayev, on the contrary, believes that matter in a food.
Talysha love meat, bread and most of all dairy products much of them drink on a glass of drawn butter every day. However it is unlikely such high-calorific diet can be healthy from the diyetologichesky point of view.
Or matter in a primitive way of life which keeps to people youth? In Chengemiran, the tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, lives Rubab Mirzoev.
In 97 years it is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in the simple wooden house typical for all Caucasian region.
She sits on a floor with an oil barrel which tirelessly rolls there-here.
Here under one roof there live eight people, including one of sons and Mirzayeva's daughter who already have long ago grandsons.
Also nearby two kids skip.
In kitchen for guests prepare tea which give in typical big-bellied glasses армуду.
Mirzayeva has ideally equal and strong white teeth, under a head scarf she hides long chestnut-colored braids which her son with pride opens before us.
I always wash hair with milk so they never dropped out and kept color.
"And I never used shampoo", - Mirzayeva speaks.
The monthly pension suffices on life
She always ate only that grew in own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For all life I never bought products in shop.
Then she tells about the husband who served in army.
It was heaviest after World War II.
But it became better when "the beloved father" Heydar Aliyev got up at a wheel.
Promotion not often sounds in speech of the old woman.
However the cult created round a figure of the father of the nation which ruled the country as the dictator, in Azerbaijan practically knows no limit.
It was in power till 2003, then reins of government were accepted by his son Ilham.
Nevertheless among the Azerbaijani old men there is no poverty.
230 manats (approximately to equally same sum of euro) Mirzayev receive monthly as pension, for local conditions it is the sum for which it is possible to live well.
And, probably, long ago Mirzayeva's grown son too the rights: "Old men in our culture are respected deep respect".
They live in a big family, are loved, surrounded with care and are happy.
Than not the reason to survive as it is possible more long

The word "human right" is absent in the constitution
Revolution returned to Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo testify to deep split of the country.
Future constitution based on Sharia, met furious repulse.
The Egyptian president didn't stint pathos.
We have to create transition.
"And its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before god", - he told on the state television.
His speech was turned to all people, but first of all to Christian Copts, the liberals, the educated Muslims and not religious Egyptians.
After all all of them who still have been hopelessly separated in confused opposition, feel fear.
Fear before the religious state on Nile on favor of powerful "Muslim Brotherhood".
Mohamed Morsi, without apologizing almost, I told that he temporarily cut off competence of the constitutional court and expanded the competence, "to rescue revolution".
However that actually the 61-year-old engineer having degree of the doctor of the American university of South California wants to rescue, isn't quite clear to Egyptians and the whole world.
Whether judicial authority will be deprived of force?
Actually 234 articles managed to be dragged in a night 15-hour gallop with obstacles in Islamic adjusted constitutional meeting from 100 participants, and it partially causes fears.
As well as in the previous constitutions, in the project it is said that legal proceedings rely on "the principles of the Islamic right".
But what means "principles"?
It was and remains interpretation business, and it is possible to be afraid that Islamists will use the indistinct formulation and arising in connection with it legal люфт for more strict interpretation of Sharia.
At least, one newly introduced article hints at it: in all affairs concerning Sharia, it is necessary to attract for council university Al-Ashar, the most important Islamic establishment of the country having big authority on all Sunni Islam.
It shouldn't, but can mean that the clergy supervises behind the legislation that de facto would have a consequence restriction of judicial authority.
In the draft of the constitution a lot of things are an interpretation subject
One more problem: jurisdiction of civilians to military court has to remain.
These courts in the period of the power of Mubarak served for suppression of oppositionists.
After overthrow of the dictator in the military conclusion were to 11.000 civilians.
Also, as it is told in the project, the state has to protect "true essence of the Egyptian family" and "to support its morals and values".
Legally it is formulated so indistinctly that public institutions by means of this article will be able to supervise even the maintenance of cinema and literature.
In clear it means no other than censorship.
In general any article doesn't establish directly equality of men and women.
But another forbids to offend and discredit prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
But that such insult and as it has to be punished, remains not clear.
Doubtful the formulation that "the insult of people" is forbidden also is submitted.
Whether will be caricatures on the president or jokes about the jurist enough?
The interpretation question, as well as a lot of things, according to him, will be presented soon" in this project which Murcia offers for the signature and which to Egyptians on a referendum.
"Revolution returned"
Some weeks the opposition against a superiority of Islamists is formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity in the evening of Friday on Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy this document still before it will be able to come into force.
"Revolution returned, and we will win", - Hamdin Sabbakhi who has taken the third place on presidential election told.
The Nobel prize winner of the world and the former head of the international department on atomic energy Mohammed El-Baradei declared that to the draft of the constitution a place "on an ash heap of history".
Through service of short news of Twitter he accused adherents of Murcia of desire to head "putsch against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to its palace and we will send it", - oppositionist Yasser Said told.
"We weren't tired yet, blood of our brothers yet отмщена", - quoted the Egyptian mass media of oppositional politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that don't want to watch a referendum that would make it invalid.
"The Koran - our constitution"
Well organized "Muslim Brotherhood", in turn, called for opposite demonstration, but, from precaution, not on Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on other coast of Nile before Cairo university.
A large number of women took part in it under covers and adherents салафитов which shouted: "The people demand God's application of the law".
They demanded from Murcia: "Clear the country! " also assured: "The Koran - our constitution".
Race for power over the symbolical area on which everything began, provoked a condition of almost civil war.
Followers of Murcia, quite obviously, didn't want to go on this risk.
"Muslim Brotherhood" declared that both opponents, and supporters of the draft of the constitution spoke loudly and clearly.
Now came to allow to the people to solve time at a ballot box, in what direction the country has to go.
The majority for the project of Islamists, is considered it the solved business.
"The concept "human rights" isn't mentioned never"
Hafiz Abu Sayeda in rage from this forced constitutional process which, generally, had to last till February with participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old lawyer on human rights and the chairman of the Egyptian organization on human rights (EOPR) protected "Muslim Brotherhood" when at Mubarak they were imprisoned or appeared before the court.
Not because it shared their outlook but because human rights for it are indivisible.
He was beaten, sentenced, arrested for it.
And now the words "human rights" never meet in the new constitution, he regrets in conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
Expansion of influence of Murcia on all three branches of the power disappoints the lawyer in the state.
These measures represent obvious blows to democratic rules of the game and will lead Egyptians to new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto cancelled it", - Sayeda regrets.
After all without civil public organizations the democracy can't function.
Sayeda feels that all left it, even the international community which looks at ideological fight of the directions on Nile with a curiosity and tension mix.
For it there can come payment.
The demonstrator on Tahrir Square warns: "You create the monster whom you won't be able to supervise".

Norwegian ракфиск: the smelling fish most badly in the world?
At the five-million population of Norway one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but also around the world.
Probably, the secret of success of this country is somehow connected with local addiction to one extremely fetid fish dish?
Take some become overripe pieces of cheese.
Place them in a lot of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there on a week.
At you the smell striking sense of smell ракфиска - one of the best-known Norwegian delicacies will turn out.
I am in a small town under the name Fagernes, in three hours' journey from Oslo.
Around the picturesque types covered with snow. It is very beautiful, but in air the ineradicable characteristic smell is poured.
Rakfisk is the trout salted and roaming in water about one year, depending on what musty smell need to achieve.
As twilight is condensed and becomes cold, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes, devoted to this most, we will tell so, to a fascinating dish.
"It eat crude and wash down with a shot glass аквавита, local caraway vodka", - Havard Halvarsen, the local firefighter by profession and in combination "the rakfiskovy general" who directs carrying out a festival explains.
Everywhere round us people eat the fish cut by small cubes and wash down her with considerable portions of alcohol.
"It is pleasant to someone аквавит, than ракфиск more", - Havard speaks.
This drink is capable to interrupt a smell.
I try couple of slices.
If it is possible to carry by a piece near by, everything isn't so bad - a little than differs from a portion of a land which you long carried with yourselves in the bus.
Rakfisk is the Norwegian product from absolutely other times, poverty times when, even before emergence of refrigerators, fish in the fall presoaked in hermetically sealed barrels with salty water.
Then in the deep winter when fish already well and thoroughly began to ferment, her took and, having muffled perception alcohol, used in food.
For memories of last generation that fact that thousands Norwegians were compelled to leave the country in job searches and to emigrate, mainly, to the USA.
Now the population promptly grows - more than 13% are made by immigrants who are attracted here by workplaces, high salaries and the developed system of social security.
Inhabitants of Sweden (the old rival, and not very long ago and much more prosperous neighbor) in large quantities come here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as a certain important symbol, indispensable, though a little fetid element of the past of Norway.
This one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here everything is expensive - the small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost to you 9 pounds sterling (14 US dollars).
Norway seldom appears in world news, and the majority of inhabitants of the country, seemingly, suits it.
People here still reluctantly mention Anders Breyvik's name, the racist and the extremist of the right sense, last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, act of terrorism call "happened on July 22".
It is very difficult to Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of similar atrocities and murders.
At the heart of today's wellbeing of Norway growth (since the beginning of the seventieth) one of the largest oil and gas branches in the world lies.
"However oil - not the only reason of our prosperity", - speaks Anna, our waitress carrying trays with sustained rakfisky, the woman with a long fair hair and amazingly blue eyes, an embodiment of Nordic wellbeing.
We such people - as you call it - judicious.
As well as the majority of Norwegians, she perfectly speaks English.
We don't like to be exposed on display, we aren't boastful.
Norway very carefully addresses with the oil - the most part of the income of oil and gas branch is invested in the special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years preceding the world financial crisis when all squandered money which at them wasn't, Norway it is economical I counted all expenses.
"While it is possible to ski in the winter and to go hiking in the summer, it is enough of it for happiness", - Anna speaks.
"Also is ракфиск", - she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in snow in a queue for any food - ракфиска I have had enough.
Here the hamburger with losiny meat is exactly exotic, tasty juicy meat.
But in the evening we wait still bigger quantity of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel carry out the special dinner devoted ракфиск during which visitors determine by vote the best or, probably, the most fragrant fish.
There is a direct air in which show the leader in a tie butterfly, surrounded with plates with the rakfisky.
It is similar to the song competition "Eurovision".
"So, the Torahs Juergen, what assessment you put for the best fish there at yourselves in mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, here our assessment"....
All laugh and applaud.
Someone falls from a chair, probably, having touched аквавита.
Or perhaps having simply inhaled a smell of this fish.

The hard beginning of the career is necessary to the president of Mexico Enrique Penya Nyeto.
While the newly elected president of Mexico Enrique Penya Nyeto is going to enter a position, the correspondent of BBC Will Grant invites us to look at difficulties which it should face, and on the mixed expectations of the population of its country.
Traffic in Mexico City now in especially deplorable condition.
This city is overloaded with transport and in the best time, and since Monday the steel obstacles which cutting some key highways to the capital and have caused chaos on roads were erected.
However it was made not not to allow people to reach for work from suburbs and to prevent participants of protests to get to the parliament building.
On Sunday the new head of Mexico Enrique Penya Nyeto will put on a presidential sling and will accept reins of government the country.
It is faced by a difficult task.
Mexico achieved good economic indicators at Felipe Calderon's administration which now puts the powers, however the country wallowed in war with drugs which in six years already carried away about 60.000 lives.
"My government declares to the people of Mexico the readiness to struggle with violence", - Mr. Penya Nyeto told earlier this week to the U.S. President Barack Obama in an oval office of the White house.
I am going to offer new strategy of safety which will allow us to reach this goal.
To such statements near the U.S. President political career of Mr. Penya Nyeto developed on a post of the governor of his native state of Mexico City.
On its homeland, in the densely populated and extensive staff surrounding the capital of the country, opinions on the new head were shared.
Rectilinear person
In the idyllic small town of Valye-de-Bravo, for example, it remember with warmth.
Inhabitants put it down to credit tourism revival, development of the resort sphere and infrastructure creation.
It is possible to reach the city on one of the new highways constructed by g-ohm of Penya Nyeto which strikingly differ from roads with hollows and holes which were earlier on this place.
Plates with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum devoted to climatic changes.
"We pin on it hopes of real and serious changes", - the friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the congressman of staff from institutional and revolutionary party (PRI) led by Penya Nyeto tells it.
We expect the real and resolute changes which are so sharply necessary for our country, first of all in the field of safety and economic development.
After 81 year of continuous stay in power the PRI party was forced out in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera recognizes that after him 12 summer absence in the presidential palace Los-Pinos the party lays hopes on Enrique Penya Nyeto.
Besides, it disproves charges of triviality which were brought to the new president by opposition.
It is very rectilinear and very devoted to business of an embodiment of the vision of the future of the country.
This is the excellent statesman, and, first of all, the person, able to listen.
But in other part of staff many people had other idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkoyotl known also under the name of Syyudad-Nes, is the most striking contrast with paved streets of Valye-de-Bravo.
Hidden under platforms of highways, it in many meanings is the suburb of the Mexico City.
And problems in municipality too have severe character of this megalopolis.
Earlier this year for suppression of the gangs trading in drugs in these areas, armies were attracted; and the violence concerning women has here especially acuity.
On the waste ground near an extensive dump only some tens bodies of the killed women in the last two years were revealed.
More than one thousand women was killed in the state of Mexico City during a governorship of Mr. Penya Nyeto is considerably exceeds a similar indicator in the city of Ciudad Juárez which has sadly become famous for violence which name became nominal when speech comes about murder of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Penya Nyeto, about him at the best it is possible to tell that during the stay on a post of the governor he didn't manage to cope with a problem of murder of women.
In the worst case its administration accuse of full ignoring of this problem.
The inhabitant of the concrete house similar to the majority of houses in this decayed area, Irinei Buendy hardly constrains tears, showing me photos of the late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version Mariana in 2010 committed suicide.
However her family considers that it was killed by her roommate.
"When I reached her house, was it seems that her body before it washed up", - Mrs. Buendiya remembers.
There were signs of that it was beaten, and the body already stiffened.
Mariana's mother retells this history, and the portrait of the daughter looks at us from a wall where it hangs near a crucifixion on which only one word is traced: justice.
It, according to them, it was refused to this family.
"Officials of staff treated me as with the old gossip dissatisfied with the violator of tranquillity.
They want that people simply took trust everything that they speak, and kept mum.
But it is wrong, so it is impossible, in particular when around there are a lot of violations and defects", - she speaks.
Having put on a presidential sling on Saturday, president Penya Nyeto together with it will assume hard responsibility.
For the last six years tens of thousands of families in Mexico mentioned the crimes connected with violence, and the new president promised to make the solution of this problem priority during the board.
"I hope that he will be just the same president what was the governor", - Olvera, the congressman from Valye-de-Bravo from PRI party speaks.
However the family of victims in Syyudad-Nes most of all are afraid of it.

Bradley Manning didn't complain of the bad address, declares charge.
Accusers try to refute Bradley Manning's statements for bad conditions of detention.
During hearing special attention was paid to Manning's stay in military prison in Kvantiko, the State of Virginia.
Protection demands to close business on the ground that conditions of the conclusion of Manning were cruel.
The private of army of the USA accuse of stealing of several thousand classified documents.
On Friday charge tried to prove that private Bradley Manning accused of the largest leakage of secret materials in the history of the USA, didn't use a set of opportunities to make the complaint to the bad address which, according to him, he happened to transfer, being in military prison.
During cross-examination at pre-judicial hearing in the Fort Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State of Maryland, the military prosecutor major Eshden Feyn declared that records of weekly visits of Manning by representatives of administration of prison in nine months of his contents in Kvantiko, the State of Virginia, don't contain complaints to the bad address.
Cross-examination within consideration of the petition of protection about diversion of Manning of that conditions of its conclusion were cruel and in itself were sufficient punishment, was carried out next day after Manning declared that being in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
The military specialist in the analysis of the prospecting data, arrested in June, 2010, is accused of stealing of several thousand classified documents during service in Iraq.
These materials were published subsequently on the Internet on a site WikiLeaks.
The WikiLeaks resource didn't confirm that Manning was a source of information.
During hearing on Friday prosecutor Feyn together with Manning saw reports which were filled in after Manning's visits by representatives of administration during his stay in Kvantiko's prison where it was on the terms of a high security of the conclusion from July, 2010 to April, 2011.
During visits serving prisons asked to Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked on Friday about reports, Manning recognized that estimates the address to from prison administration as "excellent", and the general conditions of the conclusion as "very professionally organized".
The considered reports don't contain complaints to the bad address in spite of the fact that Manning directly asked about conditions of his contents, Feyn claims.
Manning answered that he expressed oral concern about these problems and that representatives of administration visiting it discussed with it these problems and declared that in them will be engaged, but didn't fix it in writing.
"They wrote down "problems are absent" (after discussion of my complaints), but it doesn't mean that I didn't lift this subject in conversation", - Manning speaks.
The military judge, colonel Deniz Lind, too I asked Manning why that didn't complain of the illegal treatment of him in January, 2011 during meeting of the commission considering suicide intentions which it expressed in writing for some months before.
Manning answered that during that meeting he wanted to achieve that from it removed a mode of "injury prevention" and softened conclusion conditions.
Representatives of the military management explained that the limited mode of the conclusion - is one level lower, than the supervision mode for the purpose of suicide prevention - was entered for protection of the prisoner, and also for the sake of safety of others.
"I wanted to let know administrations that with me everything is all right that they cancelled an injury prevention mode... that level of mine life improved, from my point of view", - Manning explained.
On Thursday Manning testified to the arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait where nearly two months before transferred to prison on naval base in Kvantiko, the State of Virginia, in July, 2010 contained it.
He reported that thoughts of suicide appeared at it in Kuwait, and that once he fainted because of a strong heat.
It explained that is psychologically very heavy when to you don't let know as your fate is decided, and that occurs in the outside world.
"My world contracted to base Camp-Arifzhan, to the sizes of my prison, - Manning on Thursday told.
- I thought that I will die in this cage".
Being in Kvantiko, Manning, according to him, carried out the most part of time in the small camera - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours per day - all alone.
Manning reports that to him allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, bedroom-slippers, some articles of clothing and points.
He says that tried to move as to sleep or even it is simple to lie in the afternoon forbade rules.
According to Manning, during a dream into eyes to it constantly I hit light getting outside of the camera.
If security guards didn't see his face when it turned over in a bed at night, according to him, him awoke and forced to turn over on a back.
Advocaat Manning gave official objection concerning the illegal treatment of Manning in January, 2011.
In April, 2011 Manning transferred to military prison in Fort-Livenvort, the State of Kansas.
Besides, on Friday the judge asked Manning on the statement which it made during evidence on Thursday, that after once at night he forced to sleep naked in its camera in Kvantiko, it forced to face naked security guards and other prisoners on morning check.
Manning declared that had no opportunity to be covered with a blanket during check.
Answering questions of the judge on Friday, Manning told that understood from the order of the security guard that has to throw a blanket with which it could be covered, but recognized that anybody directly didn't order it to throw it.
On Thursday Manning declared that last night him forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show to the officer that it doesn't constitute danger to.
Manning reported that told the officer that could use an elastic band of pants or bedroom-slippers to injure itself, but didn't make it.
That night, under Manning's certificate, his underwear, bedroom-slippers and points took away from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge, at least, will consider that he had to worry during the conclusion, and will significantly reduce an imprisonment term in case Manning is found guilty by military court which has to begin consideration of its business in the beginning of the next year.
Protection declared that plans to suggest Manning to admit guilt for less serious crimes, and to challenge other charges as excessive.
Renewal of hearings is planned for these days off, it is expected that the party of charge will insist that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning contained in Kvantiko according to the rules regulating the maintenance of arrested with the most high security.
Among the charges, put forward to Manning, illegal assistance to publication of data in the Internet, the information transfer, concerning national defense, and stealing of state ownership or documents are registered complicity to the opponent.
If he is condemned at all points the indictment, the life imprisonment can threaten it.

My crisis of national self-determination - the story of the American of the Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were compelled to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans are inclined to blame those who left because they remind inhabitants of the country of hard times.
Ruben Navaretta considers that Mexicans of the American origin are broken off between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City I passed along the corridor for arriving, came nearer to a zone of border control and froze.
Signs indicated two turns: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I faced some seconds them, without knowing where to go.
I grew in the central California, and me all life called the Mexican.
This simply conditional name just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves as Italians.
Later I stopped on a difficult design "the American of the Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need in conditional names or difficult designs.
I was simply American.
I speak Spanish to ask rather well questions or to answer them.
But my lexicon is poorer, than at native speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
Therefore I got the American passport and became in turn for Extranjeros.
I remembered this history a few days ago when the newly elected president of Mexico Enrique Penya Nyeto visited the White house and met the president Obama.
On the agenda there were habitual for meetings of presidents of these countries questions: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penya Nyeto willingly spoke about lifting of the Mexican economy thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico instead of getting over to the United States.
He wants to sign the contract on partnership with the USA and Canada and to create a certain North American trade block like the European Union.
Besides, president Penya Nyeto promised to continue war against narcocartels in Mexico, however any specific proposals didn't sound.
For Mexico the relations with the United States - the question heavy and executed of old offenses.
The majority of Americans never reflected that in 1848 the United States intruded in Mexico and under a barrel of rifles compelled her leaders to refuse a half of the territory.
But Mexicans think centuries, instead of minutes, and see reminders on those events in everything.
Therefore any statesman of the USA needs to mention though the criticism word towards Mexico, in the press and among elite of the Mexican society complaints that Americans encroach on the sovereignty of neighbors are right there distributed.
And Montezuma's descendants are filled with eagerness to fight.
Thus the relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of the Mexican origin, living in the USA are the most difficult.
You want to talk about offenses?
It is enough of them.
In Mexico there are winners and lost, people who find in this country for itself opportunities, and for whom such opportunities aren't present.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio there are a lot of people of the Mexican origin only for one reason: at some instant their family history someone - the father or the grandfather - had no opportunity to realize itself in Mexico and was compelled to go to the north.
Most often it were Mexicans of a certain type - swarty, poorly educated, from poor country families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico it see differently.
Today our life is an embodiment of the American dream, we studied at good schools and got good job, but to us not to forget what even this dream - American, instead of Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and isn't clear, but we know, what country to consider as the.
United States of America.
Besides we know that the majority of representatives of the Mexican elite and ruling class don't love us.
We answer them with the same.
They see in us a reminder on humiliating defeats and treat us as to people of the second grade, as to artificial Mexicans.
We insufficiently well speak Spanish, and our communications with Mexico are insufficiently strong.
Our existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't leave.
We wouldn't appear now behind a silk curtain, having found in the USA full life, but having lost spiritual touches.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the USA in the childhood, and it reminds me that between the real Mexicans and Americans of the Mexican origin there are certain friction - Mexicans understand the national identity more accurately, and it is offensive for Americans of the Mexican origin.
She is the citizen of the USA and considers that belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time my many familiar Americans of the Mexican origin don't feel belonging to one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we love also Bruce Springsteen.
Receiving best of two worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
In Mexico we are Americans.
And in the USA us call Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during the trip as though our relations without that are insufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and representatives of the intellectuals want to restore the relations with diaspora.
They want that Americans of the Mexican origin worked as some kind of ambassadors of Mexico and presented its interests to the USA.
We could tell to the American friends about what is the beautiful country and as it is healthy to visit it, and could convince political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Aha, certainly.
It won't work.
It is too much offenses in the past.
And considering a gap between rich and poor, the corruption and drug traffic revelry, many of us at all don't consider this country such fine.
Excuse, but deal with it, амигос.
And it is fair.
If the part of Mexicans can't still forgive to the United States how they arrived with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they should take and that fact that some Americans of the Mexican origin still in offense for how quite recently in Mexico managed with their relatives.
Yes.
Perhaps, we have more than general, than it seemed to me.

Old fights in the new Middle East
The Ceasefire Agreement between Israel and Hamas group can become the fragile base for the further world
Whether the long-term world between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East is possible?
The next round of bloodshed pushes to a conclusion about futility of such hopes.
Sound, the become habitual, senseless disputes on the one who began the first; set of buildings are ruined; over 140 Palestinians the majority from which made civilians, and six Israelis are killed; for the first time during the conflict, let out from the territory of the Gaza Strip of the rocket fell in a neighborhood of the capital of Israel of Tel Aviv and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
However in spite of the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly got stuck in the immemorial conflict, changes came to the Middle East.
It is possible to treat it differently, however events began to whirl "Arab spring" a set of the settled realities in a rebellious storm, and Palestinians with Israelis didn't manage to stand aside from the whirlwind which has shaken the region.
It becomes possible, as a result, their fight of even more bloody than earlier.
However there are the reasons, giving vent hope on from this deadly deadlock.
War without winners
At first sight current situation doesn't give reasons for optimism.
Even if ceasefire, the agreement about which was signed on November 21, will be carried out, the collisions which have occurred on this week only strengthened positions of security officers from both parties.
Leaders of the Islamic Hamas which has come to the power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will declare that they compelled Israel to recede, despite the losses suffered by them.
In spite of the fact that some leaders of group were destroyed, and 1,7 million inhabitants are blocked in one of the most densely populated and problem corners of our planet, Israel didn't manage to destroy Hamas.
Actually Hamas increases the popularity on the West Bank - one more Palestinian territory supervised now by more moderate movement of Fatah.
Moreover, leaders of Hamas can quite come to a conclusion that time works for them.
In process of growth of influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world Hamas has new influential and rich friends.
The reviving regional leader Turkey which once was the closest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, acted with Hamas support; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.
Triumphing supporters of Hamas declare creation round Israel of an Islamic half moon - from Lebanon in the north in which the militarized Hezbollah group, to Syria in which more and more pro-Islamic insurgents it is just about overthrown Bashar Assad's power, and further to Jordan where the authorities of the king threaten allies of Hamas governs.
The most considerable change of balance of forces in the region happened on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt where at president Mohammed Mursi movement influence the Muslim Brotherhood became stronger.
Hosni Mubarak who ruled Egypt within 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was the secular dictator who wasn't paying special attention to support of Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the contrary, is the organization in many respects similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements of Hamas can become the significant player, whose voice won't manage to be muffled even to Israel and America.
At the same time supporters of the "rigid" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In military sense of Hamas it was prostrate.
The Israeli antimissile system "Iron Dome" justified costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the rockets started Hamas.
Citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least any time.
As for diplomacy, the USA remained are true the invariable position; many European countries also laid blame for the beginning of a final round of violence on Hamas.
One more important factor is economic prosperity of Israel, in particular at the government of Benjamin Netanyahu who substantially ignored peace process.
In spite of the fact that since 2004 about 30 Israelis were lost from the rockets released from the territory of the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize a problem of suicide bombers, partly at the expense of a wall which comes on the territory of the West Bank - considerable part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements which continue to extend despite illegality of such actions from the point of view of the international legislation.
The position of prime minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - within preparation for the elections planned for January 22 - united with even more aggressively adjusted conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What sense to indulge Palestinians and to give them own state?
If to give in their charge all power in the territory of the West bank, whether they from there will start starting rockets towards Israel how it is done by their colleagues in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to hold them behind a wall and rigidly to suppress any attempts to raise the heads.
Probably, supporters of the "rigid" line will win a victory; however their calculations can be disproved in the Arab spring.
Thus that Islamists who come to the power in Egypt and other countries, have not the most warm feelings to Israel, internal problems become their priority task.
The defensive part of the budget of Israel is more, than at all his Arab neighbors, together taken.
The initiation of war with a regional superstate hardly will help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen own economy.
The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Murcia which together with Barack Obama worked over ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark itself the beginning of changes.
Israel, in not smaller degree, has to consider long-term consequences of the policy.
In process of approach of democratic changes in the Arab countries, deprivation of Palestinians of the right to self-determination represents a time bomb which will blow up sooner or later in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus which has been blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
Repressions already undermine bases of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - growth of the Arab population - only aggravates these problems.
For bloody operations which are performed everyone some years in the territory of the Gaza Strip for Hamas suppression, it is necessary to pay in growing discontent of the international community.
Both parties need an external impulse
There is the only decision for which sane representatives from both parties, and also the most part of other world and our newspaper continued call: formation of two states and a concession Israel of territories in exchange for safety.
There is a hope, not too impressive in short-term prospect, - hope that ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the conflict parties more effectively.
Egypt long ago it is time to them to make the decision to block arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, and also Turkey and Qatar have, more than ever, advantageous position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state accepted since 1967 taking into account an exchange of territories and sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries also have to make efforts reconciliation of movements of Hamas and Fatah.
It would make more for creation of the Palestinian state, than the forthcoming vote in the UN recognition of virtual statehood of Palestine can become which result.
The role in setting Israel for a negotiating table, has to play and the president Obama.
During the first term it didn't submit own plan of peaceful settlement.
After return to the White house it still shows unwillingness to be connected to the solution of this problem.
It is catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States are vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
It is possible only in case of the peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.

In Australia the law on the unified packing for cigarettes came into force.
Preventions of harm of smoking and the image of the parts of a body struck with diseases contrastly are allocated on the sad green boxes identical to all brands of cigarettes.
The Australian law first in world practice on the same packing of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color registration of different brands by an identical box of sad and olive color with terrible pictures of the parts of a body struck with an illness and images of children which health is undermined by smoking of their parents.
Besides different pictures and the inscriptions warning about harm of smoking, the only difference between the packs, entered without fail since this Saturday - name of brands which are printed with an identical small print.
These are the most severe in the world of a condition for registration of packings of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia declares that the purpose of this measure - to hold youth from smoking, depriving this addiction of the fashionable status.
In a basis of such decision results of the researches which have shown laid down that the people, not started to smoke till 26 years, in 99 cases from 100 so never and don't become smokers.
"It is obvious, what even at the most early age children understand sense which the tobacco companies by means of packing registration" try to inform, - Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek explains, referring to the researches which have shown that, for example, the crown in a logo associates at children with idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the share of smokers smallest in the world so these changes won't especially affect profit of multinational corporations, however possibility of acceptance of similar measures is considered already also by other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strenuously counteracted adoption of this law.
The tobacco companies claim that it only will increase a share of the black market in which cheap and available cigarettes will be on sale.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, other than what reflected his initiators", - Scott Makintayr, the representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia considers.
Producers of counterfeit production from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha from the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that demand for cigarette cases and the silicone cases hiding unpleasant pictures on packing, promptly grew (practically from scratch) since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in high court of Australia where tried to appeal against this law.
According to Sandra Ha, the Zico company already realized about six thousand products to the enterprises of wholesale trade and expects new party.
For us it is good business.
Potential hindrance for efficiency of similar measures is, according to experts, popularity of social networks among that part of the population on which these measures are directed.
After acceptance in Australia of a number of the laws which have made illegal TV advertizing of cigarettes and support by them of sporting events, and also forbidding to sellers to expose cigarettes in a visible place, advertizing of tobacco products moved to the Internet.
The government of Australia forbade the local companies and websites to place advertizing in a network, but it can't limit in it foreign sites.
"If you trade in tobacco products and you still had only this small opening, idea to advance the goods on the Internet will seem to you the extremely tempting", - Beki Friman, investigating questions of public health at University of Sydney explains.
Freeman notes growth of number of reviews of the trademarks, the ordinary users written from the face allegedly, on such social networks, as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
There is a question - whether this work of the ordinary citizen who so loves Marlboro cigarettes what didn't regret forces and time is valid and made the video, or behind it there is an advertizing company?
The Australian office of the British American Tobacco company claims that in branch now are more occupied with adaptation to new rules, than advertizing.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures, as sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and Dominican Republic for contest of new rules: these states make a complaint within the World Trade Organization, declaring to that trade underwent unfair to restrictions in spite of the fact that trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.
The decision of the WTO is expected to the middle of 2013.
According to Thani Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries possibility of adoption by them of similar laws on packing.
In 2001 Canada the first entered obligatory placement of the photos warning about harm of smoking.
Now this rule is accepted in more than 40 countries, including in Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Possibility of toughening of laws is considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa and India.
Great number of smokers in Australia defiantly don't obey innovations.
These pictures don't touch me.
I simply don't pay attention.
"Simply you snatch out a cigarette and you hide a pack in a pocket", - Victor El Heyg buying cigarettes with the photo of a tumor of a mouth on a pack explains.
Frankly speaking, the only thing that can force me to throw is my small daughter.
James Yu managing shop of the tobacco products King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that identical packing complicated a problem of arrangement of goods of regiments
"Earlier at me on unloading of new party hour, and now four hours left", - he complains.
"The government should take and absolutely to forbid a cigarette, we then would tell: what to do, all right, everything is over, we close shop", - he speaks, throwing up hands up.

To miss in the world of electronic networks and continuous connections it isn't so bad.
I unexpectedly had to spend five hours to this Thanksgiving Day at the airport because mechanical malfunctions were found in our plane and it replaced with other plane of which we and waited.
Thus, I had enough time for reflections about the boredom nature.
I won't deceive you.
In the afternoon at the airport waiting for flight it is really boring, and here not strongly will help neither books, nor magazines, iPhone, even duty free shops.
However recently more and more scientists and specialists in children's development express in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss not so badly.
It compels a brain to distract for interesting adjacent subjects that, probably, promotes creativity.
And as all of us constantly are in the modern world in front of any screen, advantages of boredom pass by us.
We need to strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time isn't present.
We still will return to it.
Earlier I, as well as many, considered that boredom - the invention of rather recent times when people had more free time.
It not so, is approved by Peter Tui, the professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University Calgary, the author of the book "Fascinating History of Boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"Actually the boredom can brag of very ancient history", - he speaks.
On walls in Pompeii Latin inscriptions about the boredom, dated are found the first eyelid.
Thus there is open a question of how we understand boredom.
The problem in that, says John D. Eastwood, the associate professor of University York in Ontario, Canada that the understanding and boredom vision often changed.
Having studied materials of researches on this subject and having asked a question to target group in 100 people, professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: the boredom is when people "want, but can't be engaged in that would bring them satisfaction".
Difference between boredom and apathy, he speaks, is that the missing person doesn't do something that would like to do.
At apathy of it doesn't want to do.
The basic in endured boredom, he says, it "violation of attention and the moods connected about it deterioration and feeling of that time hangs heavy".
According to the description the boredom can seem very similar to a depression.
However professor Eastwood claims that despite possible communication between these conditions, missing people see the reasons of problems in world around and circumstances, and the people enduring a depression, see problems in themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us that it is boring for us when actually it is simply difficult to us to concentrate on something.
In the research "Unoccupied reason: boredom definition from the point of view of attention", published in September issue of the Perspectives on Psychological Science magazine, professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the experiment made earlier which participants listened to record of the voice reading the magazine.
One participants heard also loud sounds of the irrelevant TV program included in the neighboring room, others heard the same sounds on low the loudness so they could be sorted, and the third group listened only to record of a voice without a foreign sound track.
Those participants who heard the TV with low level of loudness, noted that it was boring for them, is more often than others - it was difficult to them to concentrate, but they didn't know the reason of it and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to concentrate attention on a difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, Mark Dzh speaks. Fensk, the associate professor of neurology at Gvelf's University, Ontario, and one of authors of this research.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, peering at a stream of products on the conveyor in search of the marriage, distracting music can help to avoid boredom".
It is considered, it continues that when people start rocking on a chair or to draw a scribble on a sheet of paper, they do it with boredom, however now we know that actually such actions simply help not to relax physically.
"Research showed that children to whom don't forbid to fidget and spin, study better and more information, than children from whom demand to sit quietly" remember, - the professor Fensk claims.
At any moments all of us test boredom: at a flight delay (as in my case), listening to monotonous speech, looking through the uninteresting movie.
However different people show different degree of tendency to boredom.
In the 1980th years researchers developed for measurement of such specific features special "a scale of tendency to boredom".
For assessment definition on such scale questions and statements, for example, "A lot of things from this are used that I should do, monotonously and monotonously" or "Too a lot of things are interesting to me therefore on anything there is no time".
Researchers defined by such questionnaires that boys miss more often than girls, - Stephen Vodanovich, the professor of psychology at University of the Western Florida, - in particular in the presence of various external irritants speaks.
However as a whole teenagers in general often miss.
In 1991 Read Larsson, the professor of personal and social development at University of Illinois, made experiment during which it contacted the help of a pager almost with 400 teenagers and their parents of 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of teenagers declared that is boring for them at school and during homework performance, and 23% declared that is boring for them outside school.
Thus only 3% of parents noted that it is boring for them.
Professor Larsson notes that he has no data on what would be similar data on boredom now, a 21 year later.
However he knows that "it is the share of teenage age peak of tendency to boredom", generally because to children and teenagers don't allow to solve fully, than to be engaged in it.
Let's return to my initial question: the boredom is useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations it as show researches, can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risk gamblings or abuse of certain substances in attempts to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers reflected on communication between boredom and creativity, professor Vodanovich who has devoted to studying of this problem more than two decades speaks.
"So our brain prompts to us that it is necessary to be engaged in something another; it also is boredom", - tells Gary Marcus, the professor of psychology at the New York university.
However this brain not always knows in what exactly it is better to be engaged.
If it is boring for you and you will direct this energy on game on a guitar or culinary experiences, you will make to yourselves better.
However if you begin to watch TV, to you it becomes better only for some time, and it will pass soon.
Therefore if your child misses and you give him iPad, it will cease to miss, however he won't learn to struggle with boredom independently or somehow otherwise to operate the time and employment, - the professor Fensk speaks.
"And such skills of independent regulation are involved in the most different situations", - he claims.
Your child learns not only to occupy independently himself with something, he also studies self-checking in general.
I don't think that the boredom needs to be extolled somehow.
However to consider it as something bad too isn't necessary.
It is necessary to learn to feel comfortably even out of a continuous stream of actions and technologies rather.
Professor Eastwood agrees with it.
"We see it so that we need to test more often boredom, thus that the boredom is the extremely unpleasant, unsatiable desire to be engaged in something intelligent", - he speaks.
Actually people seek to be disconnected somehow from constant cares and it is simple to relax.
"In the modern world we got used to continuous excessive stimulation of sense organs, - he speaks, - and when there comes silence, we are lost and we don't know that to do".

While it is unclear as the new law on marihuana legalization in the State of Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orosko, the nineteen-year-old player of a soccer team and the student of public college in the southeast of the State of Colorado is accused of commission of the criminal offense, being that will be absolutely lawful in all territory of the state soon: storage of a small portion of marihuana and tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko says that once in September he with friends was in Lamar and went in the car on the prairie near border with Kansas when they were stopped by police officers.
After the police officer found marihuana in the car, to Mr. Orosko the summons for storage of drugs and knowledge of the adaptation for the use of drugs - small offenses came, the penalty is due for each of which of 100 dollars - and date of a court session is appointed.
"With us treat as criminals", - Mr. Orosko speaks.
Whether but criminal it?
As a result of uncertainty which proceeds some weeks after the State of Colorado voted for legalization of the use of marihuana in small amounts for entertainment, the solution of hundreds small lawsuits depends not so much on the law, how many on a consideration place.
Charges of the small offenses connected with marihuana, already are removed in hundred cases here and in the State of Washington which took a similar measure.
Police stations already stopped bringing charges to aged people of 21 years and are more senior for storage of small doses that will begin to be considered lawful as soon as in few weeks the law will come into force.
However in more conservative districts of Colorado accusers made the decision to consider the existing cases connected with marihuana, and still make responsible for storage of this drug.
At the same time in some cities from suburbs of Denver to mountain regions of the West vote to allowing emergence in their places of the new shops licensed by staff on marihuana sale.
"All this develops so promptly that I at all don't know that to wait further", - Deniyel Dzh speaks. Оутс, the chief of police in the small town the Aurora in the east from Denver.
Representatives of supervisory authorities in the State of Washington too it is puzzled scratch the heads.
They should create rules for definition of an order of licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and marihuana sale, and all this needs to be made till December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, it is good or it is bad, advances the majority of other states in settlement of use of marihuana, at first in the medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado more ordered market therefore they will serve as a good example", - Brian I. Smith, the representative of Council for regulation of production and sale of alcoholic products in the State of Washington explains.
But now nobody can make more, Mr. Smith recognizes, than to put forward any offers and to hope that it will work.
"We have no real precedent by which we could be guided", - he speaks.
The bill of the State of Washington called I-502, will come into force on December 6 and for the whole year will cast staff into a condition of uncertainty when the system of the state licensing still isn't present, and the right of possession of marihuana is already legalized.
And there are after all still difficult technical aspects which need to be solved during this period, for example, how to find balance between the staff order about "adequate access" to the licensed marihuana with a ban on trade in it at distance of 1000 foots from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be especially difficult to place the licensed enterprises for trade in marihuana within the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs", - Ben Livingston, the representative of recently created research group "Center of Legalization of Marihuana" explains.
On November 21 the chief of police of Outs from the Aurora dispatched to the subordinates by e-mail the message that the prosecutor's office of the city won't attract any more the persons which have reached age 21 year, to responsibility for possession of a small amount of marihuana and that the police stops convicting people of these violations "from this time".
The chief of police of Outs reported that the police will watch observance in the city of the rules regulating activity of persons, growing up marihuana in the medical purposes, and will pursue illegal dealers and distributors of drugs.
The prosecutor of the district Ueld in the north of Colorado, Ken Bak, represents more strict approach to this question.
After vote under the bill he declared that the prosecutor's office still will make responsible for possession of marihuana, mainly to induce using her faces to receive medical treatment.
At present accusations of storage of two and less ounces of marihuana though many of them are accused and of other violations are brought to 119 persons.
"An obligation of our institution - to pursue for actions which are considered criminal at the time of their commission", - the Mr. Tank in the statement told.
Reaction was ambiguous even in such places, as Mes's rural district where participants of vote rejected the offer on marihuana legalization.
The police Grandee Dzhankshn, the largest city in the district, any more doesn't make responsible full age for possession of a small amount of drug.
District attorney Pete Hauttsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss charges on already open affairs connected with storage of marihuana.
"I consider that to provide law observance until it won't change - our direct duty", - he speaks.
In spite of the fact that 55% of inhabitants of the State of Colorado which have taken part in vote, supported this decision, inclusion of questions of use of marihuana for entertainments in the state and legal system won't be simple.
And inconsistent reaction of inhabitants in different places of staff bared ambiguity of the relation of local authorities to staff experiment with marihuana.
"District attorneys in this question have a cultural barrier", - Sean Makalister, the Denver lawyer representing interests of condemned for storage of marihuana, and the local representative of the National organization of reforming of laws on marihuana explains.
"They so long pursued people for it that now can't reconcile to that it any more a crime", - is told by him really.
Colorado and Washington - to the first states in which a small amount of marihuana treat the same as to alcohol - is fated to become an experimental field in country scales for check of the idea of legalization of drugs.
Supporters of legalization and officials of staff plan to broaden the territory of the legalized trade, but at the same time they cautiously wait for instructions from federal the authorities which still plan to consider sale and marihuana cultivation as federal crimes.
Supporters of legalization of marihuana hope that the Justice department will concede in this question.
Despite the arrests which have slightly received a broad resonance of dealers and the patients using marihuana on medical indications, the federal government in most cases authorized trade in marihuana in the medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Fight agents of Bureau with drugs will rush hardly into houses to confiscate a small bag of marihuana, however they hardly will begin to close eyes on regulated by the staff authorities shops of recreational marihuana which are resolved under the new law, Kevin A. Sabet, the former adviser for questions of fight against drugs in Obama's administration considers.
Some cities in Colorado didn't begin to wait actions of the federal authorities.
To presidential election some local administrations approved the moratorium on opening of new shops on marihuana sale which and so couldn't open earlier, than in a year.
Last week Montrose, the city in the western part of staff, nominated a six-months ban on trade in marihuana which, most likely, will be approved next week to consideration.
"We don't want to appear in such situation that we will grant to someone the license, and then it will cause serious problems at federal level", - Bob Nicholson, the member of city council speaks.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now the contradiction is available at us between results of local vote and subjects, for what staff voted.
There are more many unresolved questions.

Petronella Uayett: me survived from Oxford that I am a conservative.
Prosecutions of students of universities for their views began not today.
How many I remember myself, I always dreamed to arrive in the Oxford university.
Mine the father and the big brother studied in Oxford and described it as the educational institution best in the world, the modern analog of an antique symposium putting two bases of a civilization - free-thinking and tolerance.
And still, two weeks of study later on department of history of Worcester college of the Oxford university in the late eighties, I collected suitcases and left that poured out in the first real scandal in my life.
My father didn't sustain and began to cry.
Friends were confused.
The The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I threw college because it wasn't pleasant to me that my classmates have sex in the neighboring room.
Writer E.Normann Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from chipped cups.
Actually everything wasn't so amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because me systematically poisoned and intimidated.
At all because of my quite unusual name or that I studied at private school.
Me poisoned only for one reason, and in this glorified cradle of culture it looked the true barbarity and blind fanaticism: my father, nowadays the late Woodrow Uayett, was known for adviser Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of conservatives.
You ask, why to remember it now?
According to the last data, the new generation of students adhering to right-centrist views, is exposed to the same persecution.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred to conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week the group of such students demanded the same protection of the rights, as that which is provided to disabled people, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from student's club of the Christie's Case college in Cambridge declare that them "often actively isolate, subject to personal attacks and force to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter into committee on the equal rights of college of the additional representative to provide freedom of expression of the opinion.
Their situation was aggravated only by the documentary film which has left recently on BBC 2 about policy in the student's environment "A wonderland: young, clever and right" in which conservatives presented clowns and neo-Nazis.
In the movie Joe Cook, the former president of Association of conservatives of the Oxford university who goes in Rolls-Royce was shown, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver knob.
At other universities conservative students complain that of them do "whipping boys because of increase of a payment for study".
Luke Blek, 20 years, the vice-president of Association of conservatives of Nottingham university, in interview of one of Sunday newspapers told that "in the university environment the distortion towards left-wing views increases.
People who at all don't know us, consider us in advance as impudent and with impunity violent children of rich parents".
Semyuel Roberts, 21 year, the student of department of history of the Christie's Case college in whom the application on protection strengthening was submitted, calls such atmosphere "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new president of Association of conservatives of the Oxford university, says that the relation of members of student's club to carriers of right-centrist views considerably worsened.
"It represents threat as for the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, and it is simple for normal life of clubmen", - she speaks.
The first some weeks in Oxford I was not simply in minority, I was one.
I arrived there in September, 1986, the shy and timid eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was in a fever with hatred to conservative party.
In a year before the university vote deprived the former student Margaret Thatcher of her honourable degree because of reduction of budgetary appropriations on the higher education.
In such atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even to Stalinists.
In the first days of the week of the first-year student when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time that waited for me ahead.
I yet didn't know that teachers not only made light of persecution of conservative students, but also with pleasure took in it part.
Political affairs - a strike of miners, privatization and disagreement of the government to apply sanctions against the apartheid government - got into the Republic of South Africa through the walls of audiences sheathed by wooden panels.
At my first seminar I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I wasn't ready to that followed it.
"Ms. Uayett, - the teacher, nowadays the late Harry Pitt, - please told, translate the first paragraph".
The text was given me hardly, I faltered.
Harry Pitt was very choleric man with the person similar to a pie.
"Tetcherista essentially don't study French or simply brains don't suffice to them? " - he asked.
Other students started giggling.
At me tears in the eyes acted.
"I advise to you to take some initial lessons of French in free time if you, of course, aren't so occupied, mixing in society", - Pitt grumbled.
I returned to the room of the absolutely unfortunate.
That evening in college I sat at dinner one; then someone patted me shoulder.
It was James, the second-year student from faculty of English which was presented as the member of Association of conservatives of university.
"I know who you are, - he told friendly.
- Unfortunately, business is as follows:
over everyone whom suspect of sympathies for conservatives, will scoff.
To me it is hard, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher therefore to you it will be more difficult.
The majority of conservative first-year students pretend to be that they are labourists".
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to play the hypocrite.
I insisted that agrees not with everything that speaks to Margaret Thatcher.
Cunning wasn't successful.
The first-year student of faculty of philosophy, policy and economy who itself studied in Eton, told: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You infectious".
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How conservatives have sex? - I asked one of them.
- They bang each other, the truth?"
I felt as, has to be, homosexuals before cancellation of criminal prosecution in the sixties felt.
Whether I will be able sometime to lead normal life in Oxford?
Or I should meet adherents only under the screen of night?
Whether I will be compelled to become a labourite and to hide the real belief?
Three years coming me began to seem a hell full of persecutions and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, the conservative views, Norman Stone, the professor of modern history wasn't hiding.
It hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also that he was an adviser Thatcher concerning foreign policy and one of her speech writers.
In college it practically didn't appear.
He despised it for provinciality, meanness and commitment Marxist детерминистскому to a view of history.
In 1997 it accepted a professorial position at university of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you won't be happy", - he told me.
I began to go to Oxford from the parental house in London, trying to find a shelter among relatives and impartial capital friends.
I told the father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
It didn't believe me.
During its study in the forties any political views there were accepted.
"But after all same the best university in the world, - was told by him plaintively.
- There of the such aren't capable, only not in the city of dozing spikes...
Even my communist friends always behaved faultlessly".
His damp eyes grew turbid.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I am sure that it simply jokes.
You will hurt to me heart if you throw university".
I was exhausted with constants to trips to London and my emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also the conservative, didn't sustain pressure and refused the belief.
Next week during a seminar when the next teacher of history absolutely seriously called me "the enemy of the people", I decided to arrive as.
In soul being burned with shame, I admitted that "I was raked over the coals by parents", and called them "old fools".
The respite was short.
My father was fated to hammer the last nail into a cover of a coffin of my career in Oxford.
At that time he wrote every week on two columns for the editions belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I didn't return.
You can call me the crybaby and a rag.
But in eighteen years nobody has to become object of such rage and intimidations in educational institution.
That is more sad that it was Oxford which not only let out fourteen prime ministers of the Tory, but also to this day is behind undeserved reputation of university at which appreciate equality and free-thinking.

About an exhibition "Valentino: the master of sewing" which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Nati Abaskal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemitsa and other known clients of the Italian designer
The Somerset house, the former residence of English queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, worthy to accept an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized it during opening "Valentino: the master of sewing", a triumphal retrospective exhibition which unites more than 130 dresses of the haute couture created by his "house" over the last 50 years.
"I adore this palace", - he speaks with the unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is final part of the history which only character - "or the signor" Garavani, however it couldn't be written without his eminent clients.
Valentino always felt the fascinated rare and far world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition opened till March 3, personal letters and photos signed by the most notable aristocrats, from princess Salima Aga-khan to the lord of Snowdon, including Mari-Chantal, the princess of Greece, and Margaret, the princess of Great Britain abound.
Valentino shows these personal memoirs as trophies of the social lifting: from the modest tailor from the city of Vogera in the north of Italy to an idol of international "elite".
To be in love with a royal yard - in it there is nothing bad.
"They at least don't extinguish stubs of the cigarettes about your magnificent carpet as it is done by some fine stars of pop music", - baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitsa speaks.
In the 60th and 70th years both of us lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino - the matchless owner also receives guests with generosity and elegance.
"All of us very much liked to come to its chalet in Gshtaada", - the former wife "Hayni" Tissen, the close girlfriend of the forgotten beauties like Marella Anyelli or Evgenia Niarkhos explains.
Valentino always preferred elegance to glory.
And despite it, it - a star.
The Valery Mazz, representing to Valentino
Valery Mazz's Argentina model remembers the charismatic fashion designer.
Once we went to have supper to it home, it was after fashion show on the area of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy the-junior.
Valentino's style was shown in everything - in each detail of his apartment, in its furniture, in food, in music.
"To each of Valentino's guests I allowed to feel important and favourite", - remembers the "top model" which work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during a Week of haute couture in Paris.
"It never gets out of fashion because its sketches are the real works of art", - it finishes.
Parade of family trees
Garavani's life - history not oderzhimost, and vlyublennost with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of galleries the Somerset house was turned into a glamourous podium of sixty meters in length which offers change of roles: the visitor takes a place of models and has to defile on a podium, beholding "audience" from dreams which sparkle masterpieces from Valentino, such as a dress which Jacqueline Kennedy for the wedding with Aristotle Onassis chose, a suit which was used by Monica Vitti in "Night", or a coat from wool and skin which belonged to the empress Farah Dib.
In this public from models such names, as Sibilla Lyuksemburgskaya, Gloria von Turn унд Taksis, with Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg shine.
Here you are Abaskal and the fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - as the first love, "it is impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It were trousers, a shirt, "vest" and a jacket from a collection fall-winter 1971-1972.
"It was the gift which it to me gave", - speaks to Nati Abaskal, one of muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to the rests for his feminity, for his big love to women because he emphasizes our beauty", - the former duchess de Feria adds.
I very much like colors which it uses: in them there is a lot of light and they "approach" to his face.
Proportions are ideal.
The princess and fashion-maker Patritsia della Dzhovampaola д "Arenberg too can't forget the first time when put on in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I will have age and an occasion to put on one of its evening dresses...
At last that hour in the late nineties came.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put on it a holiday in the lock of my cousin, the prince Edward de Tench.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with frills, "corsage" pleated and cut without shoulder-straps.
"It was the dream which has become a reality", - Rodrigo's widow д "Arenberg speaks.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless", - this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires explains.
The princess д "Arenberg stores the festive dresses from the fashion designer with "the maximum care... because the dress it isn't simple a dress, it also set of the memoirs accompanying it".
"King" of fashion
The great ending of an exhibition in the Somerset house - Mari-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlosom from Greece in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer of the seamstresses calls) were required to make this dress of silk of color of an ivory with incrustation by the pearls, twelve types of various laces and a loop in four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Syuzi Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone of haute couture of the end of the XX century, "return of clients from the high society".
Drugged many years "lifestyle" of elite, now Valentino himself is her best representative.
The gentleman of the Big cross (a distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Gentleman of work, the Commodore of an award of Arts and the literature, awarded the order the Honourable legion, Garavani collected as much honors, how many any of spouses of his clients.
"Always my attention was drawn by its refinement, its tranquillity, its accurate and faultless appearance", - Arenberg remembers д ".
The last time I saw it a month ago during a solemn dinner in D'Orsay Museum.
He sat at a table with countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"It was perfect, time doesn't exist for it".
If it is told by the princess...

The heaviest profession in the world: miners from Kavakh-Idzhen
For four euros the Indonesian miners risk life and health, dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur on volcano top on cool stony tracks
There are people for whom their work - a hell, and others literally work in a hell.
Among them Anto Vidzhaya, one of 400 miners who earn on life by sulfur production in Kavakh-Idzhen's located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java the volcano.
Every day Anto goes down on the bottom of a crater where the sulphurous gas rising from depths of Earth, stiffens at contact with air.
Having broken away huge pieces of the sulfur which gross weight can reach 70 kg, it puts them in two bamboo baskets, shoulders baskets and bears them upward on the steep stony road.
To the volcano top which height makes 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, however are required to emaciated loaders more than 40 minutes to rise at a snail's pace, hardly keeping balance and carefully groping the road not to stumble and to fall from break.
They know that one wrong move can cost them life as it happened to one tourist from France which broke a few years ago from Kavakh-Idzhen's rocks.
Miners from Kavakh-Idzhen earn 5 eurocents for each kilogram of sulfur which extract
Having appeared above, they force the way through between tourists who photograph them as though they were monkeys from circus and, wearily bearing heavy baskets, three kilometers to scales which the mining company arranged slightly above, at the height of 1.850 meters walk.
It is a question of PT Kandy of Ngrimbi, the enterprise which operates since 1960 this volcano and, better and not to tell, the workers to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10.000 rupees (83 eurocents) to petrochemical productions, after all this mineral is widespread in an everyday life and is used for production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for sugar bleaching.
"As norm is carrying of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each trip", - explains us Anto who usually carries out three daily carryings.
It spends three hours for each of them and at the end feels broken, however they allow it to save up 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of day.
Though it seems a hardly anything for such inhuman effort, it is three times more than that it would earn in the field.
"The day payment to miners is very high by local standards where 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros) pay for gathering coffee a day and average monthly earnings is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)", - the loader who worked as the bricklayer at the tourist island of Bali earlier explains.
There its salary made 75.000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the site wasn't such heavy, but Anto returned with the family to Banyyuvangi, small town near a volcano, for the weighty reason which in Indonesia is same shattering as sulfur: "I married the girl from Bali where one induist, and I brought her to Java that it accepted Islam".
Anto has an asthma, he labors for breath, constantly coughs, and at him слезятся eyes because of toxic gases
In the 27 years Anto spent three years, risking itself in Kavakh-Idzhen which sulfur already started affecting it despite existence of a mask and special glasses.
It has an asthma, he labors for breath, constantly coughs, and at it слезятся eyes because of toxic gases which are emitted by a volcano.
It is the price which he has to pay for achievement of the dream.
"Two more years because I want to open shop will work or to study Spanish or French", - he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and clever young man could be the tourist guide, the waiter or the porter in hotel, but instead it performs work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur doesn't cease to follow at night when its characteristic yellow color turns in blue and shines among a gloom.
Throwing down a challenge to shadows, Anto goes down in a crater, shining itself the road with the small lamp connected to its helmet which he bought on the money.
About 400 porters drag baskets with sulfur on the shoulders from a volcano bottom
Despite high profits, the mining company didn't mechanize sulfur production for economy of expenses and doesn't provide any equipment to porters who work for the account and with such deprivations.
Actually, they don't receive even part from 30.000 rupees (2,5 euros) charge for photographing which, along with the entrance ticket for 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros), security guards of this reserve raise from tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its people mules.
"This work for cattle, instead of for people", - declares to Badrusin, the thickset porter of 42 years who spent three decades since left college on Kavakh-Idzhen.
Capable to lift to 110 kilograms, he assures that will suffer work "so much, how many will be able" because money for education of the three children aged from 18 till 10 years is necessary to it.
I won't retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life
Though sulfur burns a throat and burns down eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense columns of a smoke leaving a volcano, they are so hardy that any doesn't complain of the serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their habitual trouble breathing, arthroses, knee pains and shoulder ulcers which were deformed under weight of baskets.
Balancing with a basket on a back, Unaynik only can lift now 50 kilograms in the 53 years.
Every day it and his companions take out 15 tons of sulfur from a volcano which three trucks transport on a warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming distance in 18 kilometers on a narrow track among thickets.
"I won't retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life", - Unaynik declares, widely opening a mouth in which there is no several teeth.
From his five children, the senior, 30 years, too works with a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty immortalizes from generation to generation one of the heaviest occupations in the world: in what human mules from Kavakh-Idzhen are engaged.

Singapore looks for children to rescue economy
Singaporeans accuse career, a stress and housing prices and education of absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow".
I am a husband the patriot, you are my spouse the patriot, we will fulfill our civic duty and we will create life!
Can seem improbable that these lines are part of advertizing of mint flat cakes, however despite it - or probably thanks to it is this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of a rap which uses local sayings it seems "Let's put бао (roll) in an oven" to laugh over birth rate level in Singapore.
The advertizing agency which made this video, BBH, cherishes hope that by means of advertizing they will manage to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, speaks that wanted to use the music force that people fulfilled "the national duty".
This thing only for the Internet therefore we needed to make it cheerful and ridiculous.
It is the main problem in the country.
We the worst in the world on reproduction similar therefore we felt that is that subject which we have to mention.
We knew that the government tried to make a lot of things, for example to carry out start of a pheromone perfume or to organize parties of fast acquaintances (blitz appointments).
Many of these ideas, probably, were creative, but optional worked.
Therefore we thought why us not to make the most creative thing from possible to solve this problem, namely to compose a rap?
1,2 children
Who doesn't perceive it so thoughtlessly, so this government of Singapore.
It spends 1.300 US dollars a year for policy for enthusiasm of citizens on the birth of bigger number of children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides to 15.000 dollars on the child, prolongs maternity leaves and provides tax privileges.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and hi-tech state city in South East Asia, also known for conservatism of the management and the strict public control.
Birth rate level in Singapore, according to its national administration on the population, is now at the level of 1,2 children on the woman.
The last time it was lower than 2 - that is known as replacement percent - in 1976.
So why Singaporeans have no bigger number of children?
Tan Vey Min, the director of Office of policy of married couples and families of National administration of the population, says that the reason for that "the improved education" and "wider scale of career opportunities".
"It allowed people to have wider scale of options in that, as for the vital purposes and priorities, besides a wedding and family creation", - she explains.
These changes of social norms promote growth of number of bachelors and postponement of marriages and the births of children therefore birth rate level in Singapore decreased.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy which is directed on sharp increase in immigration for opposition to population reduction, causes indignation among local population.
In Singapore there are websites where hardly hidden xenophobia concerning many new immigrants prospers, in particular Chinese whom criticize for maintenance of salaries at a low level and unwillingness to be integrated.
Immigration growth also is considered as one of the reasons of that last year the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result on elections since independence.
After elections there was an attempt to solve a problem, by means of quotas and more heavy taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling of birth rate has known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, expenses on medicine and policy of immigration, the example of Singapore also starts having some unexpected consequences.
The government makes efforts that so much small housing wasn't under construction.
For example, it started influencing real estate sector.
The guide to city development passed to control of number of the small apartments known as "a shoe box" which can be built in certain districts of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters very well are on sale.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote a single way of life and deprive of incentive of builders who want to build big family housing.
But Lim Yu Put, the director general of house-building firm EL Developers, says that them "shoe boxes" are on sale much quicker, than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in that sense that such apartments are bought up for some days, even weeks, quicker, than apartments of the bigger size.
As a result of it our monetary receipts increase.
Nevertheless, he recognizes that new norms give clearer reference points for builders to whom put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project earlier.
The too overstrained
Singapore is a city-state.
Though these new rules can be a step in the direction of increase in national birth rate, after conversation with Singaporeans who work in financial quarter of the center, apparently, that they won't have special effect.
"People are very overstrained, housing expensive, also as well as education, and because of it many people postpone it", - the young manager speaks.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to have own money and time", - other young man of 20 years speaks.
Men and women mention the career, a stress and housing prices and education as the reasons which prevent them to bring children.
So, as though the government tried to induce the citizens by the birth of children, in that, as for a child-bearing, the last word remains for Singaporeans.

Personal in an offline - personal in online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of Royal academy of Spanish, it is a question of property private or "to the sphere of private life which have the right to protect from any intervention".
What is personal for the minor 16 years are more younger?
How it applies this definition in the everyday life and on social networks?
Whether he understands dangers to which is exposed at discussion on the Internet of situations which for certain wouldn't share out of the Internet?
elPeriódico interviewed five children from ten to 15 years, frequent users of a network.
In four cases they associated the term with "something very much mine", in the personal plane, and "the password and a user name" when applied it to social networks.
"I wouldn't load my biggest secrets into a post", - ten-year-old Jorge when tries to explain value personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where it has accounts two years speaks.
"It is very confidential secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world", - he claims.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
Also I have a good time with the acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share the photo which doing not wash, or someone who behaves silly", - he speaks.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes or to write offensive or furious comments.
Jorge assures that knows 35 friends, which at him in FB, and the nine followers in Twitter.
Majority of them relatives.
In a course, she has mother the password to one of accounts.
I got Twitter to express itself and to write interesting tweets.
"I don't know, whether answer me, I only load them", - he adds.
"Social networks - entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or to the friends quickly", - he specifies.
Without reflecting, answers that never would accept inquiry from the unfamiliar person.
Wouldn't began to reckon with someone who would recommend it to the stranger.
14-year-old José's case differs.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the last recognizes that doesn't know 20 people added in its list of friends.
"It doesn't frighten me because we have something the general, music, for example", - specifies it.
According to the boy, anybody didn't ingratiate with him and didn't ask his home address or phone number.
"If on me begin to press or demand, I will simply remove them from the account", - he recognizes.
José became the follower of Ask after recommendation reading in Twitter.
Experience of isn't alien to the boy that today it is known as a kibermobbing.
One acquaintance of my friend blackmailed on a social network.
To it threatened and extorted money.
"He didn't learn who it was", - he assures.
The victim, according to José, didn't remove the account.
"Only I included confidentiality".
Then he explains sequence of steps for account control by safe image.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would load photos of acquaintances in inconvenient or konfuzny situations.
Yes, I would make it if the person isn't pleasant to me or if I want it.
"Though I know that it is a kibermobbing", - it confirms.
Key questions
Maryelos Porras, the teacher of English and the expert by training and to training, considers that to direct children and teenagers, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks - to inform.
"The Internet appeared as means for information search, but with the advent of these sites rules of the game" changed, - she notes.
Porras specifies that academician Mark Prenski, the master of pedagogics from Yale university and the author of work Digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms for an explanation of this phenomenon.
Digital natives it they, children and youth who were born in an era of technologies.
"We are digital immigrants who should teach them while we still study", - she speaks.
Explains that this subject is difficult, "because we ask to have them a certain criterion of that is possible or it is impossible to extend, publish or speak, aged, when the maturity doesn't suffice for this purpose".
"Also that they were selective while it is most important to be for them popular to have thousands friends, without thinking of consequences", - she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality children and teenagers, - to ask questions which force them to reflect.
"To speak to them that they didn't do it, it is useless", - she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things which you wouldn't tell to the stranger, so why you do it on the Internet?
Or, it would be pleasant to you if published the photo you like that, what you published about the friend?
Whether you know, what others publish about you?
When you sign photos from parties, whether you ask for a permission from other people to mark out them?
And one more, whether all need to know, what you do at every moment?
One more point is to let to them know that they have to behave online the same as do it an offline.
Rules same.
"Out of the Internet of people behaves yours faithfully, responsibility and other principles as has to be on social networks", - she claims.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardy, the university teacher, the professor of primary education and the consultant by training, explains need of that heads of families politicians of social networks honestly read.
Understanding each of points, they have the good bases for conversations with children about preconditions of opening of the account on the Internet.
"For example, age and that it is authorized to extend or publish", - he speaks.
According to Gaurdy, a key question - to remind children a lesson "don't speak with strangers".

The list of participating presidents that displeased hundred journalists from various national and international mass media who asked more data was the only document extended during the day.
Subsequently the Administration of the President of Peru sent the electronic message of mass media with "the final declaration" summit, however it is a question of Umala's statement, instead of for the official document with which the summit came to the end.
Last October Peru accepted the III Summit of the South American and Arab countries (ASPA), and that time in spite of the fact that it was demanded persistently by the press, the so-called Limsky declaration which earlier declared too wasn't widespread.
On the ASPA official website it is possible to check that the document was published last Tuesday.

The summit took place in the absence of presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which membership in the Union of South American Nations it was suspended since 2011 after impeachment of his former president Fernando Lugo, I didn't participate in a meeting.
The accepting president, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening of discussions in the morning and for summit closing, soon after midday on Limsky time.

Among these projects he mentioned that five treat Peru, and are limited to cross axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at big communication with Ecuador, however it didn't provide more details.
Also final document mentioned a political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that electoral process will serve in this country to its repeated joining to the Union of the South American nations" from which now it is excluded.
Need for that Latin America remained the wellbeing and world region, would be integrated, and had good relations between neighbors, was other subject emphasized at the summit.
In this sense the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, told before starting participation in a regional meeting that hopes to meet the colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for negotiation in a valid form of sea dispute as a result of a verdict of the International Court of Justice challenged by Bogota.

"South America has to study at Europe in a question of integration of nationality": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that creation of the general nationality is the purpose in which "South America, in this case and, has to study at Europe".
Correa who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of the South American nations (Union of South American Nations), carried out in Lima, declared to the state television of Peru that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other collisions, "however now they nearly one fatherland".
It protected, in this context, the project of establishment of the South American nationality which is approved by the participating countries of the Union of South American Nations.
"It is necessary to achieve free movement of citizens and workers over any South American country as it already happens to members of the Andean community, but still there are reactionary sectors which want to return us to the past", - he warned.
The Ecuadorian president proved, besides, the supporter of renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition of decrease in influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and acceptances in attention of those who signed the Pact of San Jose about human rights.
Those who gives lectures, never assume any obligations, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, we sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Interamerican Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States", - he declared, hinting at the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks to Julian Assange.
Correa assured that isn't sorry about this decision because with it he didn't betray the principles, and observed the "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that in due time "there were certain suspicions that Assange will be extradited to the third country and process" won't be observed.
It scarified, besides, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for interrogation concerning an estimated crime on the sexual soil while "the Swedish legislation finds it possible to carry out it by means of a videoconference which could be made of embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of physical and intellectual health of Assange.
"I didn't speak with it since it arrived to our embassy, but the ambassador to me told that it had a small pulmonary problem, anything serious", - the Ecuadorian head of state told.
That really is, so it is danger of deterioration of its physical and intellectual health because of an imprisonment in small space without opportunity to do exercises on air.
"It influences health of any person", - he added.
Correa specified that the solution of the problem of the shelter granted to Assange since June in Ecuadorian embassy in London, by means of granting a guarantee of inviolability which will allow it to go to Ecuador, is in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and emphasized that there were negotiations in London about search of a solution of the problem of an imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We don't carry on negotiations on human rights, we in this case don't use this word, but there were continuous discussions.
"The solution of this problem is in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange, Baltasar Garson's lawyer, conducts a number of processes in various European instances", - he mentioned.
Also I expressed opinion that "if Great Britain will provide tomorrow an inviolability guarantee, it will end".
And if Sweden as it is allowed perfectly by its legislation and as it already did in other cases, interrogates señor Assange in embassy of Ecuador in London or will interrogate it on Skype, tomorrow this problem will be settled.
Correa used a case to prove as the defender of freedom of press and emphasized that doesn't suffer "mediocrity, dishonesty and lie which distort freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of freedom of press it is not spoiled villains politicians, and the bad journalists supporting a profit, blackmail and extortion", - he told.
In this aspect it remained happy that already these journalists, "neither bankers, nor the bourgeois countries predominant forces don't dominate in Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen revolution for development continuation in a right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto of Paraguay in the Union of South American Nations at least to the following elections, reasoning it that the organization "has to be firm and not suffer opportunism and support of revolutions behind a mask of legality" because actually "it destroyed legality of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president considered, besides, "absolutely reasonable" desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to carry on now negotiations with Nicaragua on sea borders between two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of justice of the Hague which appeared in favor of the Nicaraguan sea sovereignty.
At present this decision isn't observed.
It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they have to be overcome by desire to go together.
It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and to continue to move forward.
Also he stated hope of good completion of dispute on sea borders which conduct in the same court of Peru and Chile, and stated that "it is correct to address for Latin America in the international instances if two countries undertake to make the decision, whatever heavy it was".
Concerning opportunity to act as the candidate on the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to stand for the third term in a row, he specified that considers this opportunity "with big optimism and pleasure though it is sometimes quite heavy".
Correa assured that if will lose on elections in February, 2013, will leave public life.
In the personal plan I was never interested in the power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be corrected only from the political power.
"My political movement considered what exactly I guaranteed this probable victory so it is necessary to recognize this responsibility", - he told.
In case of a victory it would become my deadline as the president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, the same.
"This decision", - he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicolas Maduro who told me that he went on treatment which was already planned, routine and that is expected that he will pass campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean an aggravation of a state of health of president Chavez", - he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the VI summit of heads of state and government of the Union of the South American nations (Union of South American Nations) which came to the end with appeals to bigger regional integration for maintenance of progress, equality and safety.

AIDS mortality today - result of late diagnostics
Fabricio was 21 years old when to it declared that its analysis on AIDS yielded positive result.
"Me as if deafened", - he remembers that difficult, despite all step of the doctor, the moment.
The young man hid it from the family.
Having decided to cope with an illness independently, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And its efforts came true - he already celebrated the 43rd birthday.
Fabricio - one of the "oldest" patients of HIV office of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) hospital where he got in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.
He lives with the diagnosis "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) 22 years. In the early nineties it would be difficult to believe in it - too little then existed treatment options, too few knew about an illness, too took a jaundiced view of patients.
So, even the director of clinic of the Mexican institute of social protection didn't want to say goodbye to it, "because it had a cut".
Differently, in those days to have AIDS was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive at this syndrome and to make it, without worsening quality of life.
Nevertheless, without knowing about the illness, still many people come when the virus already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 year later after emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first declared cases, "big achievement at present is that a survival of the patient who begins treatment in due time, and a survival of the general population in accuracy are identical", - the head of HIV office of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva specified, having referred to that this information is confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific edition.
The infectiologist and the expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008 scientists came to a conclusion that AIDS isn't a sentence, however duration and quality of life depend on extent of defeat of the immune system which is available for patients at the beginning of diagnostics, with the best expected life expectancy at those who doesn't use drugs: up to 30 years with CD4 number 200, and to 50 years when it is reported about 500 CD4.
In other words, the aforesaid means that the one who receives the diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years", - he explained.
To estimate this progress, it is necessary to remember that life expectancy of Mexicans on the average makes today 76 years.
Though mortality considerably decreased in recent years, in case of Mexico, number of the people dying of AIDS, decreased with 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of YuNEYDS), that from the moment of emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in a national database died is also right also.
Only in Halisko 255 people died in 2011, and 187 death by May of this year are already registered; nevertheless, it is claimed that there is a universal access to anti-retrovirus preparations since 2005.
- Why still there are lethal outcomes?
- Personally it seems to me that a problem not in access to treatment.
So I imagine it, affairs in our hospital so are.
At least the last 12 years we had no lack of medicines, a problem that patients come very late because don't know about the infected condition, that is, at late stages of a disease.
It provided shattering data: "Nine of ten patients come when already have any opportunistic infection; that it is necessary to make to have a greater impact on the general mortality, so it to carry out diagnostics at earlier stage and therefore it is necessary to provide tests for detection in mass scale, for all people who will ask it".
In the offer experts and officials of the State Council in AIDS prevention in Halisko (COESIDA), and also patients, like Fabricio who addressed for check in the private laboratory, induced only that it was made by his friend and, despite the early age agree in opinion, it already was at a stage of AIDS and even had Kaposha's sarcoma, a cancer tumor which is one of widespread complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that will die, and want to know nothing.
"Time all the same I will die, I will be better to be torn three times a week", - they speak. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I well eat, I do exercises, I take medicine.
Today, his parents only know that he has a cancer.
I lead normal life, as any other.
"I work, I have many occupations, I travel, I conduct active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I care of myself and of other person", - listed Fabricio who agreed to share the private life with MILENIO JALISCO to move the statement of those who now, in a context of the World day of fight against AIDS, feels fear.
Let will be checked if there was a risk of infection, let as soon as possible learn, whether are they HIV-positive, so better and if they already have a diagnosis, let learn that can live as any other person, being responsible.
This its message summarizes a fight subject against AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind a counter
Abyss bikes between programs in the field of health care and the simple citizen, are believed by Ricardo Salazar, the journalist from Guadalajara who took up the issue, connected with HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the places devoted to this task, "actually distribution of condoms increased, earlier to us gave one or two, now to us give packages one hundred, and it is very good, but it appears that there are those who now still has no access to a condom", - he told.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections there are teenagers.
"Why they to you? " it is a popular question, with malice and condemnation, from social workers, school consultants, employees of drugstores and workers of health care which teenagers don't want to hear, the propagandist assured.
I suggest to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only behind counters and that one hundred them was in machine guns in public toilets in places which are visited often by youth.
It not dissoluteness encouragement.
Speech doesn't go about beer and motel payment, governor Emilio Gonsalez when it asked answered, whether distribution of condoms is possible at his management.
"It not sexuality, is best of all to make condoms available to those who already practises sexual activity", - he noted.
Key data in Halisko
13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) are registered.
Staff takes the 4th place in a national rating in new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.
92% of infections belong to a sexual way, 6% through blood and 2% to a perinatal way.
By estimates, 50 thousand people can live with HIV as on one registered case is from 4 to 5 people who don't know about it.

Considering ratification of the decision by appeal court of the United States which cancels restructuring of a debt of the Vitro Group, reached by means of competitive production in Mexico, the scenario establishes fatal precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country which has problems with solvency.
It seems that procedures in support of a survival of firms which are permitted by the Mexican laws, aren't valid in the country of strips and stars, in a contradiction with the international agreements.
In the practical sphere, approval of the decision passed on June 15 by the judge Harlin Hale in court of bankruptcies of the northern District of Texas, leaves defenseless the Mexican firms in the face of possibility of seizure of their property on that party of Rio Grande.
However the resolution opens doors to the leading producer of glass in Mexico for the appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, bringing into the proof three discrepancies.
As the introduction while the judge of business notes that creditors have to be regulated by the Code of the USA about bankruptcy, the Appeal court of the fifth district located in New Orleans, says that the main trial concerns the competitive production considered in Mexico.
The first point means cancellation of the international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of the enterprises of a transnational profile.
Actually, the Model law of the UN on international trade law unification was for this purpose created, defining as the arbitrator the American institute of the right.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of competitive production of debt which had Vitro branches before the parent company, wouldn't be reached the majority necessary for the adoption of restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity is recognized by the Mexican laws.
Actually, Vitro wasn't the first case when this scheme is accepted.
There are half-dozens of examples among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts guaranteed Federal institute of competitive productions.
Truly as well that subtracting voices of branches, anyway creditors of Vitro who fought against it in vessels of the United States, namely stervyatniki funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, wouldn't reach the majority.
Vote would be 45 percent against 37.
The Appeal court lowers these data.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of a difficult situation against which that came up since 2008, mentioned by a serious economic crisis which overtook the United States, striking blows about the country.
Meanwhile the family firm Gonsalez Sada will show the decision appeal in appeal court that vote reached its plenum, that is, five judges in view of the fact that three voted only.
In case of failure the petition for the certificate which will demand process revision from court of the highest authority, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States will be shown.
Worst of all that the court rejected the document directed by the government of Mexico as amicus curiae ("the friend of court") in which process to which Vitro within the Law on competitive productions follows is described, signaling that it exempts itself(himself) from observance of the agreements signed by both countries to connect it with article 15 of the Law of the USA about bankruptcy.
Besides, it is noted that the country obeyed to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations on international trade, that is, to the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Cannon from two boards: they hit into Vitro and hit into the country.
General balance
Considering the complaints postponed on some months placed on a table by labor unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarraga Andrade who is accused of roguish management, the Trade-union association of pilots of pilots already found a bottle neck.
The instance headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, just submitted the requirement of criminal case against the National commission on banks and securities which is accused of preventing to justice.
According to it, the supervisory authority systematically refused to provide reports in the Prosecutor General's Office of the republic concerning the operation executed by the businessman for extraction of confidential fund F/589 of IXE bank of 198 million peso, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed on purchase of actions of Professional management company of hotels.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of a network of Posadas hotels.
Surround Dragon Mart
Having gathered on days off at a forum at the Caribbean university, the group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved creation of the wide front for opposition to opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We speak as you know, about the huge center of sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America and Caribbean countries of production of the isolated country, with a residential zone nearby for the staff of 150 companies.
Before Canacintra it was succeeded to unite governors of a southeast zone for opposition to monumental forces which razed to the ground part of protected territories and put forward serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
Concerning the requirement of the senate rejected by the government to explain, under what conditions and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Trade agreement on fight against the counterfeiting, known as an abbreviation on English ACTA, according to the Mexican institute of industrial property, this business already passed to archive.
As you know, action was executed in spite of the fact that the senate disqualified opportunity to consider it as breaking freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in long-term prospect
Seeking to extinguish long-term debts, without influencing on short-term, the builder of housing of Homex places in the market Exchange certificates on 500 million peso.
Release is the first of four identical, with the offer of payment of percent each 28 days.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Inveterate basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes was connected more than 60 years with these sports and, thanks to it, visited the whole world.
Very few people in Puerto Rico store in memory so many basketball stories, as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And after all before the cerebral hemorrhage chained it to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was shipped in sports within more than 60 years, as the player of small categories, the player of the Highest basketball league, the representative and the head of BSN with Cowboys of Bayamon and the president of Federation of basketball.
"I carried out many roles in basketball throughout the life, including a little at the same time as when I was the president of BSN, the director general of the National team and the president of federation in the nineties", - Reyes remembers during Primera Hora visit to it home to Bayamon where he lives with Isabel, the faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes doesn't exaggerate, doing this statement.
Walls of his house, almost everything decorated with photos and the memorable things collected for its long way, testify to it.
Bayamon in heart
With the greatest emotions it stores what remember its way through Cowboys, since the middle of the 50th years as the player till 1982 when 15 years of its performance as a coagent or the agent of the contract were executed.
"It were my best years which I enjoyed most of all because had opportunity to be part of eight championships of Cowboys since 1967, as the agent, a coagent or the head.
There were many years of pleasure, including five championships, passed from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, in a year of a debut of Jerome Minsi in BSN.
Since that moment and from now on "Kuko" Aurtis who was the great administrator" began to direct, - Reyes specified.
I remember that Jean Bartov who went here and was at university of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I for you have very strong player, growth 6'7".
"You want?"
And it was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players who Puerto Rico had.
Boards then I recommended the sniper Raimonda Gauss who obtained nationality and I became one of our best goal-scorers.
I remember that told that if Minsi brought a champion's title to Bayamon, the Gauss would help to win one more.
With Gauss I took pleasure in a champion's title of Cowboys, but already at distance because by 1988 already appeared the chief of federation.
By then I preferred to enjoy its achievements and achievements of Minsi in a national team.
I remember how we won for the first time against the USA during the Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then the World Cup of 1990 in which we received the fourth place came and it there had to be a bronze if not that Canadian judge who forced us to change final game, told Reyes.
That team from the World Cup of 1990 is the best national team what you ever saw?
It among the best as well as that that won against Dream Team on Olympic Games of 2004.
But my darling was that that from Pan-American games in Cuba in 1991 when we won gold and broke the national team of the USA which was quite similar to that which won against us bronze in the World Cup.
In that team not only again played Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fiko Lopez and 'Pikulin' (Aurtis), but also young (Javier) 'Tonyito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quichotte' Morales who couldn't participate in the 90th year because of an injury of a knee.
The team which, probably, was not the best in the staff plan, but brought us a gold medal and big pleasure, there was team of the Olympic qualification tournament of 1995 in Neuken, Argentina.
With role players like 'Kanito' Nyeves, Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Hurruitner instead of players, temporarily detached for a disorder in the Pan-American championship Mar del Plata, we won gold contrary to all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubts, it there was Pikulin Aurtis.
Its indicators on the international tournaments impress.
Anybody in Puerto Rico didn't dominate at this level as it was done by Pikulin.
And it without his career in various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto-Rican the head?
It is very difficult question.
We had very good young growth including of Julio Toro, Flora Melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raimonda Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young, I very much like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you consider the main achievement in federation?
Participation in the most nice era of a national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early nineties in BSN was to 17 teams in a season.
What did you need to make?
There were things which I wanted to realize, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that boys from Ponce played only in the area and only against teams from other parts of the island in national play-off.
Now children travel and play too much, and it is excessive.
At least, I see fruits of obligatory certification and a course for managing directors, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What you now do?
Most of all I listen to music, I look musical videos of my era at YouTube, I enjoy the grandsons and occasionally I go on basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy society of my spouse, Isabel who always was with me.

Hegmen played Ewing as insatiable corrupt official with a charismatic smile: the dishonest businessman and the unfaithful husband who wanted that his spouse the alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), placed on treatment.
"I know that has to be on J.R gravestone". - Hegmen in 1988 told.
It has to be told: "Here the honest citizen of J.R is based. Ewing".
It is the only transaction which he lost.

The course which investigates "Doomsday" begins
Every week students investigate the apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, the zombie, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester when the professor of religion Stewart Sharma decided to give a course about a doomsday, he knew that had an irresistible bait: the end of "a long countdown" calendar of the Maya, on December 21 for which many people as grasped at the proof of that the doomsday approaches.
But Charm of concept had no that it expected in the next few months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, financial crisis which some call "dolgoarmageddony", and the growing conflict where will involve Israel, a place where Christian theorists of the end of times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that it will be the most apocalyptic semester from all", - told Charm this week to students of University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If to analyse that occurs in the world now as though we still had only 30 days, it was really good period.
Also you remember that bad it is good for at whom apocalyptic views.
And he isn't the only professor who offers courses on "doomsday" in this semester, theoretically the last in the history.
At Templsky university the associate professor of Barry Wacker gives the course "Mass Media, Culture and Doomsday".
Every week students investigate apocalyptic subjects, such as nuclear war, the zombie, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas extend over time", - he told, and a way with which offer the hypothetical scenarios causing certain acts of the person.
If the nuclear material falls into hands of terrorists, for example, war can burst.
This month students analyzed movies on apocalyptic subjects and studied as they correspond to examples from real life.
"I tried to tell to students that probably probably plausibly and is impossible", - told Wacker.
In the main campus of University of the State of Pennsylvania the professor of history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, the associate professor of history of art and anthropology, united to give a course which "Doomsday" is called simply.
"We don't add '2012' always to have opportunity to give a course once again in case the doomsday doesn't come", - Restall told.
Despite "inevitable destruction", students have to study, prepare projects and pass total examinations.
In Penn State total examination will be accepted on the eve of the Apocalypse that doesn't leave to students of other choice, except how to work "till that night in which allegedly there will come a doomsday", Restall told.
Courses were quite popular.
"Places ended in two hours", - Restall told about the course for students with a high GPA in which 35 students registered.
We received messages by e-mail within many weeks before a semester from people who asked, whether there are still places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course one of the most interesting.
"I like to observe that people do to console itself", - told Brigid Robinson, the 23-year-old student of office of religion and sociology from Haddonfild, to New Jersey, to Rutgers-Camden.
And apocalyptic thoughtway, secular or religious, it only question of a consolation or its absence.
Will Vekesa, the 25-year-old student of office of psychology and nurse business, told that watched all apocalyptic movies.
"I never heard about a course which would teach it", - it noticed.
It is pleasant to me.
But any of the interrogated students - not to mention the professor - didn't tell that trusts in doomsday date on December 21.
"Our first project mentioned a prophecy of the Maya, and in some way we discredited it", - told Juli Zeglen, the 21-year-old student of a last year at Templsky university from West Chester.
Maya never predicted a doomsday; it is simply key moment in a calendar, Restall told.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in the western culture which totals some centuries where people react to changes round themselves, predicting a doomsday.
The Internet caused increase in this speculation.
"In other places people don't think of it", - he told.
Mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Doherty, the professor of religion of university of La-Sal who teaches courses on Philippines this year, quickly answered a question of, whether he knows about any course about "doomsday" there.
"Philippines don't take part in a doomsday", - it wrote, hinting at the order of higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Father.
Restall paid attention that throughout long time was spoken about many days of the last court, and told that if will occur nothing on December 21, "people will start thinking at once of the following date" or to philosophize that on December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers carelessly treat this date.
Some told that are going to go for "doomsday" parties.
"Perhaps, I will call someone from friends together to laugh", - I commented Samira Ford, the 20-year-old student of faculty of communication.
