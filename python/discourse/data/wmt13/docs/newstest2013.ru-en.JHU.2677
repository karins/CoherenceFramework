Republican resistance to Obama's election strategy
Republican leaders justified their policies need to struggle against spin in the elections.
However, in the center of the бреннана believe the myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strike.
In addition, the lawyers Republicans accounted for only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing we can say with confidence: these new trends will have a negative effect on turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.
Unlike the Canadian American states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States.
This is why most state governments since 2009 pass laws, усложняющие registration process or voting.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 States.
As a result only for one year 2011 was made 180 bills, restrict the right to vote in 41 state.
New election laws require voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship and identity card with a photograph.
In addition, these laws are cutting the early voting period, упраздняют право voter registration in day expression and take away the right to vote with the citizens, who has a previous conviction.
Before the 2006 elections no American state does not oblige voters to present identification card with a photograph.
Indiana became the first state, who introduced such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law, adopted in 2008 in Indiana.
The Republican authorities hastened to spread this practice and to other states.
In the last two years they have bills, binding voters to present identity card with a photograph, in 34 States.
It is important to note that in contrast to Quebec American citizens do not have a universal ID cards, such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, then there are 21 million people, reaching the required for voting age have no identity card with a photograph, which was issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people, зарабатывающих less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of people aged 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required ID card with a photograph.
But that is not all.
Students - voters, which is supposed to vote for candidates from the democrats in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph, issued by their educational estab-lishment.
But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote for the Republicans, mainly used for voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state has demanded proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Starting in 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.
These measures, obviously, are meant to limit voting immigrants from Latin America.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have laws in 2011, упраздняющие voter registration on election day in eight states.
They also have the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction has not passed without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped to make the lists of about 10 million people.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, has led to a fall in 17% of registering new voters in 2010 as compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other States, laws, aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters, voters ahead of schedule, were афроамериканцами, although recent accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters statewide.
The same thing happened to come from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted ahead of schedule.
Unlike the white, which, forming 76% of voters, among them достроково accounted for only 46%.
Of course, законодатели-демократы and their supporters are actively opposed to adopt laws that restrict registered voters.
Several draft laws was ветировано губернаторами-демократами.
The most ambiguous laws was suspended for intervention by the Prosecutor General of the United States.
This has partly to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of 34 States adopted laws requiring ртедясчмеойс identity card with a photograph.
However, the new rules, joined the action, of course, затруднят implementation of the voting rights at the 2012 election.
Criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws that have been adopted, seeing in them a clear focus on it, to influence the 2012 election results in key states.
The report center бреннана from 2011 demonstrates that States that implemented these laws are 171 of 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing clearly: these new provisions will have a negative effect on turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.

Prostate cancer screening, pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test gives sometimes erroneous results лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные, which lead to бесполезному medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to underlying диспансеризацию is, from which begin to doubt even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
The research, conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among the groups, so the data is difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the European, found differing levels of mortality in those patients who were screened, and those who do not it took place.
The study also found that, after the 12-year-old observation, the likelihood of a metastasis in 30-40% higher than those who do not have passed screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to take from the test with 40 or 50 years, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin also are at higher risk.
The key point is that the right decision, as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and вялотекущим.
The patient needs to clarify the degree of risk his ракового disease, offering him options, without necessarily prostate cancer treatment, which poses no danger to life in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many men who have detected cancer, will not take place, as their cancer treatment not aggressive and poses no threat to life.
We will offer them an active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly we with precision define criteria for making a decision about who should or should not pass a course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend is to pass the test.
But it is important to consult with your doctor to determine or not, you have to pass the test.
In cooperation with the International Association of urology, мовембер created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons test on minoris.

To prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no чудо-рецепта, to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if all the people well fed and enough move, 30% of raco could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, this figure rose to at least 50%," said André болье, a spokesman for the Canadian association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer caused by наследственностью.
Several types of cancer are completely unaccountable.
For the Canadian association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many of the other.
It is doing enormous damage to health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says spokesman andre болье.
Promising fact: ten years after abandoning the smoking risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the car, overweight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophageal, pancreatic and ovarian cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," add the association.
Food
The association also recommends that restrict their consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer.
It should also avoid meat products.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The last may harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," "explained in the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists engaged in research on the impact of vitamin supplements to the development of cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies cannot be called clear.
According to the scc, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D and there is no complete clarity.
But Mr. Beaulieu stresses that their anxiety and family medical history is important to discuss with your doctor.
"The analysis does not lead to cancer."

Boson Higgs in detail
Last summer, a message that scientists might find boson Higgs, caused a real boom - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, nor much or little.
In addition, this is the last particle whose existence has been predicted in the standard model - our best, or, in any case," the least imperfect "descriptions of nature and behavior of matter," but that had not been found experimentally.
But physics are not fully confident that he was talking about бозоне Higgs.
We know, without any doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that she strongly resembles boson predicted the standard model Higgs.
In addition, the new data presented this week at the one major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is confirmed, although for the complete confidence of some data still lacks.
Imagine all the same, that it is about бозоне Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world one law is inevitable, гласящий, two things that cannot be in the same place at the same time.
To get around this rule there is no way, not even try too hard, otherwise навредите itself.
But although the particle physics is quite a strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: the Pauli exclusion, which suggests that the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "квантовом state" is a "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, the share of particle physics in two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called фермионами, who wisely obey the principle of spin-statistics.
In the other same scurrying around бозоны гнусная gang anarchists, who have no respect to anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can преспокойно prove to be in the same place at the same time.
According to website (by the way, quite extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, these бозоны are, in turn, into two groups: meson, of which we speak here will not, and "force" through which particles are the main forces of nature and to which in some ways is boson Higgs.
These same бозоны, it should be stressed that not all such exotic creatures, as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly банальному бозону: фотону, or "частице light," which is a "courier" electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle, which has an electric charge is accelerating or changes direction, it "violates" electromagnetic field in that particular place, like a stone, rubbed in the pond.
From this "violations" making-an-agent-of electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is nothing but, as фотоном - and, therefore, one of бозонов "a host of power."
More stable field
The same thing is happening with бозоном Higgs, with the only difference that to this boson appeared, must be "broken" another field, the Higgs field.
But the Higgs field is much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to initiate it, need to achieve very high energies, as if it was about замерзшем pond surface which could be shaken by a very large stone.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator, as one who operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful and also to explain the relationship between бозоном Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others - no: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact, have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not have it.
So, what can bring all of these studies," Ms. plamondon asks? "
In science, they are used to validate the standard model (cm), and it also allows physicists find divergence between the results of observations and predictions cm.
Besides, some of them passionately wanted to this divergence was found, T. K. the slightest discrepancy may open the door to new physics "and" plug some holes model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (ой-ой!).
But while at CERN such conflict is not found.
The consequences
Benefit from this research for the daily life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 1960s, pioneers of laser research at bell labs could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.
They foresee their application in science, but not more than that.
In fact, already the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at bell labs, where in 1960 was invented laser, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous were импульсными) in 1962., said that initially the laser was seen rather as "lab gadget."
Imagine...
And in addition, the application may have to інструментарію accompanying the study.
For example, the same уиллиард Boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, though this was not at all its original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
It is, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that it may be.

Palliative care is the best way to die... лучшие "debt"
The Commission çà äîñòîéíóþ death in Quebec recently discussed a delicate question the end of life.
The debate should soon resumed, and at this time is preparing a bill.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
"Debt" tried to look closer to home.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. gromashevsky still lived alone in his apartment in montérégie.
Prostate cancer, разрушавший it from within, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived for seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the runaway-house palliative care виктор-гадбуа in belœil, where arrived the day before.
"But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he says.
The disease does its work: unbelievable weakness, which does not give yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat.
Sitting at a table, on which is a delicious lunch, he surrenders and agrees to have helped him to eat.
He бодрится, even manages to smile, talk to strangers work around him, bring him drugs, lead him into the bath.
Courage in a death.
"My greatest desire to me cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found the cure of this malaise.
"During the life we are taught that a man must urinate standing," said Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the runaway-house виктора-гадбуа.
Regress to the child - for some an unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on the ability of people to come to terms with the decline in", "he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people, dealing with паллиативным departure, important events случаяются and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who come in palliative shelter виктор-гадбуа all suffering from cancer.
The forecasts were taken to a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses does not provide more aid, called "therapeutic."
Ms. and. 89 years, most feared to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has allowed me to know their children.
"I have good kids," she added.
"I don't want anything in life," she said, before being allowed to put her mask, облегчающую breath.
She will continue in the coming days, his son's last visit приехавшего from Italy.
In the runaway-house виктор-гадбуа with a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
This is palliative care, which remains, when nothing more can be done.
To make the death more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11 700 people are one place in the institutions of palliative care.
This very little, given that, sooner or later, we are all dead.
Here, life goes on in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel is one of the doctors shelter.
Whether the comfort of a physical, emotional or soul.
Dying we agree to provide ротовые protect of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he will ask.
Diabetic we no longer make to control sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we brought beer. Mr X, who died today at night.
His son допил this beer in the feet in the late in the morning.
"We help the relatives, as well as patients," says natalie savart, Director of patient care.
In the runaway-house виктор-гадбуа no one day is similar to the previous one.
Next to 93-летним man, who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, seated on their pillows during a toast in his honor, young people die tragic 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and перепробоваший all, in order to survive.
"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," is concerned about the Christian says Dr. Martel.
53% of patients, taken to the shelter виктор-гадбуа, come out of the House, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to паллиативному care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to паллиативному care, i.e. to care that is provided, to alleviate the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the runaway-house.
And some institutions, such as the shelter виктор-гадбуа society and palliative care at home of Montreal, are more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients.
It is this big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many doctors, specialists in паллиативному care to fear the law, легализирующего эвтаназию and help in suicide.
Since October circulates manifesto, signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. балфуром маунтом and Dr. Bernard ляпуантом and endorsing the their disagreement with this initiative.
According to Dr Christian Martel, Quebec health system not effective enough to secure the right to high quality palliative care before will be allowed a transition to euthanasia.
Recently," she says," I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I am afraid that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already were minimal, when she was exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my онкологу that I 'D stop treatment, she said that she regrets that I' D stop me struggle," she said.
At the same time she told me itself, that my days are numbered.
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank medical staff, for what they did not fulfil their request, after the team of паллиативному care makes it easier for their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain.
According to элси Monroe, director for паллиативному care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to обезболиванию in 8% of cases.
At the end of life doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, all the time.
It cannot be more than to pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more patients, which fails to ease the pain, can have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want me to установчий эвтаназию," it means "I want me to become easier."
The establishment of this report was made possible by the journalist from the Canadian Institute of Health research grant.

Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for building roads, building contractors, the funding of political parties and specialists on the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system," опутывающей construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and hit men.
"The industry," which is very expensive cost taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious, as this system breaks down after they were put in it all means," Jacques дюшено jokes, MP and former police chief Montreal. "
It is thanks to him in 2011, the scandal erupted as a result of investigation malfeasance, connected with дорожно-строительными contracts in Quebec, on which the Prime Minister of the time from liberals, Jean charest, very reluctantly agreed.
"Report дюшено" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, would only one Ministry of Transport has kept a billion dollars in contracts," if some withheld their instincts to take part.
The Commission charbonneau "has already shifted its two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will "open schemes, behind the individuals."
The permanent division to fight corruption, was created in 2011
The case подключилось created in 2011, the permanent division to fight corruption, the composition of which came in a vast state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, moreover, the staff of the special unit "hammer," which after the 2009 forced сточный "cartel" Montreal, stop завышение value of contracts.
In recent weeks has conducted a series of searches, and some municipal officials in particular Franco зампино ришару маркотту - the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
The queue - Gilles vaillancourt, recently retired from the post of mayor of de Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
His suspected неоднократном receiving bribes when placing government contracts.
In addition, the indictment of was charged several engineers to service шляхiв сполучення Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony аккурсо and Lino замбито.
The last blew up a bomb, however, Roosevelt was skeptical ñëåäñòâèþ about the "system" of government contracts.
Within a few years замбито gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal, a mediator, linked to the mob, which, in turn, translate money Party mayor жеральда tremblay "joint Montreal."
In 2000's замбито сорил money right and left. He listed more than 88 million Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) various parties province, mostly Liberals, who came back in power.
In addition, he admitted that he was illegally collected funds for former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party natalie нормандо.
Sewer contracts, in which завышали cost
In Montreal," the system worked "corruption trouble-free.
Gilles сюрпренан, a former engineer on civil construction, described in detail the Commission: in the ten years he has received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, on the golf tournaments, in restaurants, in games of hockey and bribes in total on 736 000 dollars in exchange for a sewer contracts, the cost of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that received on ëàïó завышая accounts for 30-40% with a fake additions.
Then one organizer of Party mayor, мартан Dumont, accused Mr tremblay is that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of parallel budget, наполнявшего party's dirty money.
After these revelations of Mr. tremblay resigned in early November, погрузив Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal руло was one of the first deputies in Montreal, забивших alarm.
Mayor of ривьер-де-прэри on the east of the island, it is against the 2010 sale of the municipal area, purchased for $5 million and перепроданного... for 1.6 million developers at the height of the construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She said that in the investigation, which eventually will be launched, it "drives for plug, allowing to understand the functioning of the system, кишащую ants, to stop гангрену and identify those responsible."
This process it характерезует as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning wounds, but Montreal will need its own inquiry group and the observer, to avoid a return of dubious practices.
As we убираемся home.
On a regular basis.
Jacques дюшено notes with his hand, that his officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but "especially concerned about the role of" elected officials who knew about this scheme, "but not involved in fraud.
Given that the proportion of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec offers limit to $100 donation parties, but, according to him, it will not change the situation: "as long as we will not strictly limit elective spending, in politics will be dirty money."
It requires a full reconstruction of the system of government contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go below; вникнув boldly in the essence of things, we can build a house on a more sound foundation, with the best control and legitimacy."
If this story and casts shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. дюшено encourages those who laughs, look in its own backyard.

"псж - not FC Barcelona!"
This season you in псж have achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained individual сознательностью, but can - and a new dimension of псж.
Profit great players.
Next I расту with them every day.
Technicians also brought a lot of things.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football everything is happening very quickly.
But I am not распаляюсь.
From the very beginning in the middle of the preliminary preparation in the NIF клерфонтене and before my arrival in saint-étienne I always strode forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition, the Carlo ancelotti...
Deposits of this summer in унiкальну not play matches a very high level.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to what a player such as I, poised to be the level and place to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo ancelotti has supported in my position.
He helps deputy, such as Claude makélélé, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti is respect for the maintenance staff.
Today in the first League he has no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with top clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles Paris.
In January I had with him was обнадеживающая conversation.
Then I wandered away from a series of injuries.
Trust me, which he has also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season псж?
In the first League leader Lyon took place we have.
But we are still at the ready.
One of our main objectives is: we spectacularly have been qualifying in one eighth Champions League Final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to get as much as possible.
Now it may be.
We will be able to say their word face to face with a very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to return match in one eighth of the final.
Whether псж can become a first class European club in the short term?
He has already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and secure position in a long-term perspective.
Today it is not.
Financially псж have tools to make the project viable.
Not to take the title in the first League, as last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we actual fervently wish to get the world title.
Last season we were close to it.
In May, it was frustrating, because we had all to come to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think, everything will be fine.
In spite of the fact that in the fight for the title have taken such a strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think, that we have the power to win.
Do you think that the media are too much from псж?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.
We fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we home выигрываем 4-0 against troyes and we still find for that раскритиковать, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what the first people expect from us.
We can never win every weekend with a score 4-0.
We do not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to introduce the game.
The team is formed from time to time.
We have proven in the Champions League, that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which is already two season fails to pass in one eighth of the final, although they too have spent huge amounts of money.
Given the amount invested, we were 15 points ahead of you already to winter перерыву.
It would disregard for our opponents and for the French.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new псж.
It shows how fascinating first league.
I hope that we will be able to smile and say to yourself, in May that, despite all the difficulties, we won as a result.
псж, it seems, depends entirely on the feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, if we say that there is a "златанозависимость."
This only means that ibrahimović very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
It has come to this and he proves that he first League star.
Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he is a great player and star on a global scale.
In the Group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He respects people who surround it, too.
What he did, it's really only.
It stimulates and others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also encourages all to move forward.
As you have євро-2012 from French national team?
As frustration.
I earnestly wish to participate in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time.
I saw there many things, and I came out stronger.
Today I can play good qualifier matches.
This is what I hoped since my baptism in blue.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and must now behave образцово.
What do you think about the first months of Didier дешама чолі blue?
They advance for him.
He has a good position in qualifying for the group to the world.
He strict coach, he is close with the players and inspires victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has reached its goal, he has qualified us in the euro.
I hope that Didier deschamps will blue in Brazil.
A deserved draw (1-1), вырванная on October 16 in Spain - is a fundamental match?
This match gave us confidence in themselves.
Each fought for all.
Before this shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.

Pay and sell without the help of banks - with bitcoin
A complete contrast to the current currency exchange, based on центробанках, numbered transactions between receiving the parties C Commission fees for processing them.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, bitcoin, invented сатоши накамото (a pseudonym), at the same time is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure exchange of bittorrent protocol, which allows you to exchange files between members of one level.
About 200 000 operations have already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites беруть биткойны for implementation of donations or as a means of payment.
Course биткойна, reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before to return today to about ten dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in his report about virtual currency, published in October, interest in the system.
He describes биткойн as "the most successful virtual currency," "rival the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."
биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies, as "credits" used to advance in the video game, which made during the game or who may buy (and sometimes and exchange).
Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the operation of exchange controls and always handled any central body.
In биткойн all web sites are also holders of accounting books, auditors, currency issuers, покупателыми and sellers.
How is this network?
Each deal between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only payment for each new user can choose another address, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction, signed by equipped, using encryption system with a key.
The network also can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to змісту file, possibly to check that биткойны, used in the deal, really exist in public accounts book, разосланной across the network.
The key hurdle is the registration of new transactions in this book.
It passes through the mathematical task разосланной computers, decided that, like a central bank, receives the privilege to add this new line.
It is about phase hashing file conversion, then there is a large file in a digital signature, a short and unique.
Computers "adopt" a new transaction and add to her room, before the "хэшировать" all together.
The goal is to find the number, which will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number found other nodes can easily check that it correctly.
It is thus нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change a digital signature.
If to obmana користувач very fast (less than ten minutes) would have wished to pay twice one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would have been confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer, determined to task, receives 50 биткойнов.
To avoid inflation, награда regularly is divided in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of биткойнов in circulation therefore limited to 21 million, but they делимы until one стомиллионной that leaves another reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
The network already has had its ups and downs.
Sites that provide services bitcoin were attacked, and биткойны were stolen from reserves.
"Used a defect does not apply to the Protocol," says Pierre нуаза, who recently launched paymium - company осуществляющую payments real money using network bitcoin.
The ECB also reported about possible money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But cash also have this disadvantage.
Major players such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as блог-платформа wordpress, their permit.
Recently, ADI Shamir and dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and found that almost 80% биткойнов are not in circulation.
"Giant sales-outs" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," rejoice Jon холмквист, working in coinabul, which focuses on the conversion биткойнов in gold.
Pierre нуаза, another author of the allowance for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as the operating networks.
His system, paytunia, is the equivalent of credit cards (in real money) or, payment via mobile phone, but it uses bitcoin образуемый transactions, thus getting cheaper.
The owner of better control over their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs, which do not need to install new hardware or software.
Only enough to address, which can be "photograph and recognize" phone, clarifies Pierre нуаза, reassuring that he has already thousands of users.
There is a general trend of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal.
"Before bitcoin settles itself, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to a variety of risks that are supposedly today elevated, in case the success of this system.

We have gone from Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops had left his area of responsibility in Afghanistan (kapisa province and суроби).
NATO and the Americans should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, not relying only on us.
The US suffered mostly Afghan peasants, which we regard as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and покалеченными.
The Taliban is made up of Foreign extremists, the former commanders, скрывающихся in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as it was in the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are suffering, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer, as soon as the West will behave more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from bases ниджраб, which I watched from the heights of hills засаженных almond trees with French credit, took place in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, without being атакованными.
By the end of 2014, the Taliban will not be in Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their overpowering promotion from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, the country was in the fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
The capture of them under the control of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women - paid for bigotry these farmers, in which they were al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved and in our days.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a state of dependence.
The main characters in the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become the speculators, exciting, public lands to resell them under development immigrants, returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American субподряда contracts.
They discredited; most of them, by the way, even the not fought.
People, as I have heard in rural areas, would want a government that was not of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as leave those who managed to American generosity: capital outflows substantial.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world in the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs, these young people, who do not want to return to мракобесию old parties, nor the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and the Turkish soap opera, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment the army is.
The government, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate?
The old commanders ведшие anti-Soviet struggle, already taking measures to restore provincial guards, who would not abide by the central authorities.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, must be to a certain extent децентрализован, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly before the election, stated in April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
Industry was not put on their feet, no dam функціонує, no ирригационная system is repaired.
All imported; nothing is done, except for fruit and vegetables.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would be required.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral riches.
It only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to their own.
Without energy for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot, without means of transportation to their export through the mountains, no mining.
The Chinese have almost pokinuli copper deposit of months айнак, leaving international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) dogs величезний Buddhist complex and remain the most major employers province.
It is also necessary that in one day by the Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports have restored normal relations.
The French fighting forces ended on November 20.
The new agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: liceum for girls, for boys, the Faculty of French language at the university, the French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
In 2009, in an effort to win the "hearts and minds" and meet the impossible task of assistance with offensive operations, service "военно-гражданской activities" at the Ministry of Defence (cimic), упраздненная in 2012, together with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive involvement of local labor force, could help stem the rising: irrigation wells, drinking water, regeneration, fruit trees, soil protection and increase the area of arable land.
As we leave the memory of itself, having spent two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget has promoted would improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2 000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests on the implementation of the small agricultural work, coming from the local community in the province of kapisa province.
To get rid of the uprisings руководимых foreign groups, which want to farmers, as they told me, you have to give them a small невоенную support, which would be well under and would come to him directly.

Difficult birth Constitution Egypt
This is a risky step President Mohamed morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play vabank.
Finding all by surprise, on Wednesday, he announced that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the Head of State has provided the Assembly two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on the preliminary text, in which several times were introduced amendments that weakens the institutional stability and lead to legal conflicts.
This new initiative only increased the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President is determined in his "автократическом breda," continuing "to violate the word" and "violated the right."
In the camp of his followers are confident that this way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon the intention to explain to Egyptians text, Article after Article.
The President is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging across the country.
Mohamed morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in one interview us weekly time.
The more that call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum, the Egyptian people," or you голосуете for my text, or I leave himself extraordinary powers," which, as expected, will be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, for the most part, the Islamists, voted yesterday in the text.
Most Liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, have they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey his opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to братьям-мусульманам.
It is no wonder that, in most cases the articles were проголосованы unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, amused by the fact that one of the few differences emerged around day... time for prayer, as some members of the committee concluded that the hours of the constituent assembly were incorrectly configured.
The text, which was yesterday still voted on, consists of 234 articles.
The international spotlight, Article 2 eventually remained identical to the article of the constitution of 1971, reading, that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
салафистские party, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" on the "rules" that would give the possibility of their more rigorous application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," meet the Liberals, who see in this a PR.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.
They point out in particular to Article 220, which grants al-Azhar university advisory role, in particular, with regard to verify compliance with sharia laws.
According to the expert on Egypt Sophie pommiers, it is alarming, that to." people to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can observe the emergence of theocracy."
Many Liberals, in addition, взбудоражены fact that the next President of this university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.
"At the moment, there is no specific religious interference.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the civil rights.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, is not улемы, and people with a university education, some were taught in the French system "- reassures Alexis блое, which prepares thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "around Article 220 may be the ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, ") ED.].
And in the future may be wondering how civil judge competent to make decisions about it."
In addition to their religious aspect, text, adopted yesterday, is being criticized because it gives broad powers of the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood say they significantly reduced compared to what were under the old regime.
Another controversial issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held not in Parliament and in the national defense Council.
It also will not be denied the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
The past also expressed concerns about the text, which they see as detrimental to freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now is an insult, that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles more said about protecting women, emphasizes хеба мораеф, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in the Article 36.
The word, which was in the previous constitution.
At the same time as the Egyptian President was to play last night on TV, strikes are planned today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"The great and powerful" to Moscow will: migrants will save money on language
While MPs and human rights activists argue that will give the law on compulsory language testing, the country has already appeared, fraudsters selling "липовыми" certificates
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million gastarbeiters.
Much of this Central Asia: citizens of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose is to earn money to support families, who stayed at home.
From December 1, the law came into force, according to which every labor migrants must be to take an exam on the knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule is valid only for those who want to work in the service industry, housing and utilities, побуту and retail trade.
But with time," promised in the federal migration service," tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
The grant will have not only the language, but also of Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to confirm and to obtain, and to extend work permits.
An exception is only valid for the citizens of those countries, where Russian is the official language.
People, and not covered by the успевшие get certificates and diplomas on education to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The benefits, обреченность and protection of rights
The examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language name of Pushkin, peoples' friendship University, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Pass the tests of migrants will in all cities; now in Russia have opened more than 160 such centres.
The initiative on a testing supported and members of the State Duma and the Federal migration service.
But the human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask in the press, and that it is, in fact, give?
That will change binding knowledge of the language and to the Russians, and for the visitors?
First of all," meet the representatives of the migration service," This will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery."
Very many people say now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of Russia's federal migration service in Tajikistan Victor себелев.
Protection of their rights should begin before their departure.
Only organized system will set on 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems appear the migrants without occupation, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding the language - sure себелев - the future a migrant is doomed to face new people who under the guise of aid всунут him "путёвку" in terrible close Barack, where he and dozens of such will languish for months without food and documents, вкалывая 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise one thing, and on arrival they cheat, select passport does not pay the promised wages," confirms the head of labour migration management Ms Tajikistan толиб Sharipov.
Not ругайся насяльника!
However, while many citizens of Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, recognised that not only do not know the language of the country in which seek to, but also the собственных-то write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their wine, how much trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford to get even толковое primary education.
In fact, their families can't even feed the children, not to mention that did them wear обувать and снаряжать in school.
дорастая to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult, if not with knowledge of the language," they confess.
"You feel humiliated and crippled."
However, in relation to the law about the language of human rights defenders mark an important moment.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the status - will be neither exam, no further official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or unauthorized entry воспрещен"
Many of the visitors claim that receive official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is the bureaucratic препонах and all those same language difficulties.
Moreover, the legalization of costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And here is false registration can be done quickly and all for one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists a citizen of Tajikistan умед хушкадамов.
"налетай, not скупись, buy the painting"
There are not only in the first day of the entry into force of the language, it emerged that false мигрантские documents on registration.
Several "sham" certificates on the linguistic tests have already seized by the federal migration service.
Fake papers printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners were they not for nothing: each of migrants, надеявшихся thus make their task easier проходження tests, paid for document seven thousand rubles.
It is in testing with more than two times more expensive procedures official: it will cost labour мигранту in three thousand.
In fact, that the main challenge in the near future - to protect the system from corruption, to "ID" cannot be simply buy, converge and the representatives of the authorities, and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities could promise гастарбайтерам, not managed successfully pass the test the first time, time to explore the basic language course.
In addition, visitors, not knowledgeable of Russian, will be offered work in areas not involve active communication with people.

The Interior Ministry does not take in illegal arms market turnover
The proportion of crimes with the use of legal weapons is extremely small
Russia's Interior Ministry offers to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities at the recent incidents: press shots at weddings, when it cost without victims, and butchery, designed by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry виноградовым, resulting in press killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing травматики in public places and increase the age from which you can get a license for weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea of an elected head of the Duma committee on security and combating corruption Irina яровая and promised that amendments to the law on weapons lean to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "twisting hájek."
The network has an open letter, whose authors - representatives of various public стрелковых organizations - need to abandon the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons are minimal, told the BBC Russian service юрист-криминалист Vasily foresters.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of 2012 belgrade-radio scoi crimes with the use of firearms, registered in the bodies of internal affairs, while during the same period, there were 1168 thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter assured that tightening legislation in the field of civil weapons puts the criminal not to go on "black market".
Now, according to them, you can find any weapon in Moscow at a low price.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Internal Affairs argue that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
"Black market" weapons program through multiple channels.
Major such channels five, said a retired Colonel Victor huperzia, who had worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and military headquarters.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first is "army or military footprint," that is the weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapon was dragged out and Russian officers, and Caucasians," says huperzia themselves.
The kind of "black weapons" - stolen by criminals have representatives of the security forces.
Huperzia explains that this includes and gone with police warehouses, and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "suticases" go on sale with military warehouses.
For many military warehouses often there were explosions.
"There are proven version that part of arson were made specifically to укрыть shortage," says a former military.
His contribution, according to баранца, make weapons manufacturers.
"Now get divorced private arms factories, which can withstand competition in the international market and not thrown weapons under the floors on the black market, including in Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of "black market" smuggling.
Especially many ïîñòóïàåò pistols and rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its production, sometimes primitive and arouse the Mafia, who organized the flow," explains a former military.
Where are the guns?
Experts thought, what is approximate share of each of the sources of illegal weapons on the black market."
The report about this in 2011, prepared a center of the troubled государственно-управленческого design and analysis.
Experts analyzed the statements of the Ministry of the Interior and rosstat криминологическую literature and open data portals on arms issues.
Most of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all the weapons on the black market was there "to the officials, whose work connected with weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places armed conflicts, 14% of cases occur theft on stage production of weapons, 5% fall on the "black archaeology."
Retail assistant one of weapons stores, who asked not to be identified, said that the weapons found black копателями, long ago nobody buys is too old.
More often than not, as he says, the new party sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through ensign man buys one, for example the gun TT.
He prescribed it, pass through the fence.
"He carries it in the city and sells here for 900 euros per share with two shops," he says
"However, the police informed of all cases, therefore periodically when burning plan for раскрываемости crimes, is conducting secret purchases from merchants illegal weapons," adds consultant.
"As in a luxurious shop"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through friends.
I actually look at sites, in blogs, until the friend, who proposed to arrive at the platform "begovaya answered," where will the man who увезет me in the corner, "where we will be cleared.
Price z-11 I learned only there
Military analyst Victor huperzia
To obtain a gun I need a familiar, which have a way out," says retail assistant." I have such a familiar is, but I do not believe in it.
Sellers in the markets is, but there also needs to come, figuratively," from Ivan ivanovich, who asked to convey that the daughter tooth fell."
I am now even a couple of кастетов took out through human, in which I am sure.
He, too, their supplies only me, because she knows that I do not rent the him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor huperzia tried themselves as buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.
Scheme, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photographs, where it was "anything."
"I felt like in a luxurious shop," recalls military.
The buyer, according to баранца, do not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.
I, a potential customer, not simply buy - we go with the seller in the forest, where we target.
"I give the opportunity to shoot, and when I am assured that weapons beats well, begin to bargain," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet are on websites and groups in "vkontakte," which offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
To do this, do not need any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising hat on the site "buy combat rifle or machine."
On it users leave their application and asking questions.
And a sell?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling maintained).
"Buy тт.москва" - tersely formulates the request "федоренков."
The Federal Security Service now разбросила a huge network of fake websites and want to buy the weapon is rowing by shovel.
People go, as the прикормку golodnaya fish, and then drill in Siberia coal
A military analyst and former military Victor huperzia
I heard about such schemes: usually the site registered outside the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer at the ATM produces îïëàòó.
"In response, send a photo and instruction, where hidden weapons," says spokeswoman громадської організації "right on weapons" Dmitry кислов.
Victor huperzia argues that leaving the application on the site, you can go without weapons and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service now разбросила a huge network of fake websites and want to buy the weapon is rowing by shovel.
"People go, as the прикормку golodnaya fish, and then extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, it is possible to meet the amount from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry кислова from the "right to weapons," Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
Wait ïðèäåòñÿ месяц-полтора.
He shipped from warehouses long-term storage management of these warehouses middle managers.
According to the official стастистике відомства, compared with January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in general in Russia has decreased by 7% and amounted to 22,9 thousands, and the number of identified facts theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.

Fast food and supermarket employees in the US strike
Through work on the counter "McDonald S" passes to a quarter of all American teenagers
In the last days of America, a wave of protests against low wages in department stores of Walmart and fast food restaurants popular networks, such as "McDonald S", "Burger King," "taco bell," "уэндис" and "Kentucky фрайд чикен."
While no one is predicting becomes whether this wave in the ninth shaft or her ñóæäåíî выдохнуться in the early stages.
Shares support unions and left a number of public organizations.
But modest wage increase, which receive ordinary workers Walmart and fast food system, the aim of co-sponsors of the protests is the creation of a trade union organizations in them.
As long as this sector of the economy almost not immersed in trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The campaign began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday," when in America has orgia cheap sales захватившая millions of consumers and sometimes accompanied by потасовками.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, in which worldwide employs 2.2 million people left their jobs and пикетировали together with trade unions and leftist activists stores corporation, whose product designed for people on modest and middle income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many низкооплачиваемые Walmart workers come only in their work.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap, partly because there is little pays its workers.
The past also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of lift trucks or hand scanners.
The participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" required to increase wages and complained to the fact, that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
типичному employee Walmart, получающему $9.5 per hour, this expenditure is not on budget, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will increase среднуюю salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation in $3.2 billion.
It is about 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.
If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth at the expense of buyers, then every visit to the store will do their best to 46 cents more expensive.
For a year they will spend on some 12,39 dollars more than it is now.
Supporters of the Walmart rather noted that protests have occurred in only nine States and neither малейщего damage inflicted corporation.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. to midnight Thursday of the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 goods in the second.
A total of its cash machines manufactured in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
A spokesman for the corporation Dan фогелман argued in an interview ëåâîìó site the huffington post that jobs have left a total of less than five employees of Walmart," and that "protest was simply a" инвестиционный пиаровским gimmick "slaughtering its trade union.
"Free banking!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not object department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore their here as long as no), and "макдоналдсы" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald s says that he sells billions of porcius, and after that he didn't even gives you the hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!
джумейн Williams, a member of the city council in New York
At the moment the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation is 7,25 dollars per hour.
Fast food restaurants, over time, its increase, but not much, and their average rank-and-file employees receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
In this expensive city no one earns less than them.
How can you be in New York on such money for me incomprehensible.
Once through the "макдоналдсы" took place almost a quarter of American teenagers who подрабатывали for their прилавками after school, living with parents.
Few people saw in that the main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly наталкиваюсь on interviews with workers "макдоналдсов" who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even to feed her children.
On the other hand, the forum newspaper The Wall Street Journal hangeth comment, which the author notes that irresponsible to have children, if you don't know what you are going to feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday the "макдоналдса" on 40th street and Madison avenue, demanded that кассирам and поварам fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, that is more than doubled their present minimum salary.
They also demanded that in the fast food were established trade union organizations.
American law prohibits the administration that prevent and punish the trade union movement activists harassed and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes it easier for them to life.
But to cover the trade union fast food is difficult and objective reasons.
One of the main is uncommon turnover.
Restless
Noisy protests took place in this day and have a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The highlight of the action was in the middle of the day ìèòèíã макдоналдса near Times Square," on which "have made several local политиков-демократов, in particular, a member of the City Council джумейн Williams, insisted:" McDonald S "says that he sells billions of porcius, and after that he didn't even gives you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!."
Demonstrators have supported and other prominent New York democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of bill de бласио, insisted that "we must all join in support of fast food, so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every нью-йоркец!."
As has described what happened to the New York Times, it was the largest share of this kind in American history of fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of the rapid catering, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
So far it is not clear, will establish whether this spark enjō mass movement.

"So far to fool the brain turns out rough"
Popular among fans of modern technologies тему augmented reality lately taken perceive mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, in the summer, at its annual conference the current model showed Google, and then it became known that the application for the patent filed in November and Microsoft.
But out of the conversation with the head of a group of interactive using 3-d technologies in кэмбриджской laboratory Microsoft шарамом изади suggests that this company for scientists points - the stage.
Their beckons the prospect of manipulation of the virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
Tell me, please, in general terms, what goes on in your research team?
"We are human interactions with machines, but at the same time try to раздвинуть border this interaction.
As long as mankind in mass застряло at the stage of working with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes тыканья fingers in them.
We also want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate any fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, console xbox and kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the xbox today without kinect sold, because all the interesting жестовое management.
"What we still lies ahead?
"Despite the fact that kinect suffered interaction at the physical level, much still happens at the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The improved information (system gets more data), and the conclusion is not very much.
We are trying to change this, working on a three-dimensional display systems on the basis of the various technologies, including проективных.
You need to release a computer in our physical world, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, we need to recognize not only the user, but the space around it.
Then we can add to the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell with these stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice control?
A popular thing, but not overestimate her?
"It is definitely not a panacea - raises the question of privacy, because they don't always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.
In fact all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, within which we thought we had project on gestures, but not over размашистыми, and over such скупыми short.
The gestures were not a camera device but наручным браслетом, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
As long as he's a big, but theoretically it could be reduced to the size of the wrist watches.
But in general the future for a mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice.
- It's like?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this bank газировки?
You say, and at the same time show.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- That is, you want to make users to adapt under what can or cannot at the moment the machine?
"It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more precisely determine human reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution on depth, this is very important.
"If we talk about your work with sensors xbox kinect, which you have claims to modern cameras?
Don't have permission, depth or something else?
"In principle the current generation is something from which you can start in our work on three dimensional recognition.
Of course, it might be to get megapixels 8 with the speed of 1000 to/from.
But it is not in the мегапикселях themselves, and as a matrix and depth.
With the last point of view all current technologies are not good for us - it adds work designers algorithms.
You should remember that is not only about the resolution on axes X and y and z.
Also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
The man is dynamic, and the current 30 to/from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen бетишес of our рэдмондской laboratory made the sensor touch with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 MS, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index.
Not everyone understands how this affects the human interaction and machines.
I would really have the equivalent of such a device, not only in my work requires касаний frames per second to be more.
"And the number of cameras increase does not need?
"The kinect now there are three cameras, one of which is actually" infrared emitter, "and the second is a receiver reflected signal.
And here is already the third camera is, actually, a sensor visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it, increasing the volume of payments.
It would be nice to create a flexible àíàëîã ãðàæäàíñêîìó kinect, play with camber of cameras, and see how it can help in 3D визначенні provisions.
"As far as I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, not presented to the public his glasses.
You don't think in terms of daily use augmented reality glasses - it is one of the most promising technology platforms?
"Of course, all the while slob around, holding a smartphone in raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the steep option would be" переходящая дополненная reality, when "on the basis of cloud platform you could switch to points on a smartphone, a projection screen and then everywhere.
Points is a very personal device, in that their strength (private things only see you), and at the same time weakness - дополненная reality on the basis of points you will not work on the virtual objects together with other people.
"Imagine for a moment that manipulation of the virtual голографическими objects in the air is available not only Tony старку of" Iron man, "but also a simple upon his death.
There is one issue on which often show critics such ideas: no тактильного revocation.
Hands feel nothing!
What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
"In his lectures I often say that дополненная reality is the seventh in succession a breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think, eighth may well be additive тактильных sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a background for the image.
It perfectly captures clicking!
But there are also technologies that really are aimed at giving this картинкам "in the air" осязаемости - for example, interference aimed several ultrasound rays to a certain point, where is his finger, gives a sense, but as long as it is very weak - as if you подули on pads.
There are and bracelets on the wrist, which affect the nerve endings in the toes is also a promising direction.
"And you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think that he feels that vrode should feel at that moment, when he sees something?
Is this a good idea, we have not tried to do so.
There is one more task, over which will fight for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in very limited space, to believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - work and on the concepts of cross-country tracks don't, such as in the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
Yet to fool the brain is rough, work is still very for many years.
That's what makes it work on the virtual reality such attractive to researchers - many things absolutely in their infancy.

вкусовщина instead of culture - росбалт.ру
Rosbalt continues to project "vanguard" of Petersburg, dedicated to all citizens, who are ahead, in the vanguard of art and culture.
In this топ-список already потрапили ÿðêèå firures арт-сцены St. Petersburg, whose achievements are outside the boundaries of the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing national fame.
A new hero "росбалта" - эпатажный artist êèðèëë Miller.
The whole town knows kirill Miller - bearded man's man dressed in red, which meets all the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the fashionable тусовках and вернисажах.
картины kirill Miller always gather crowds of spectators, no matter where they were.
Kirill Miller - one of a St. Petersburg социально-философских сказочников, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant man петербурзького advant-guard the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, he man city appearance on the streets of the smile, the townspeople поднимающий all mood.
He recently took шарманку and became the St. Petersburg шарманщиком in hands, as ripe for this complex role of all its богемным existence, philosophy and image.
"Kirill, and why do you still go through the city in the red, but not in yellow or бирюзовом, for example?
"I chose red as designer who views and image.
In this world of red color is a compromise between the artist, имиджмейкером and society.
Although the society all that a little Gray, not causes aggression and excitement the malign properties.
But my provocations aimed at making conversation began.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
"And when you realized that there should be an artist?
"The exhibition in the nevsky, where were exposed to my work.
I realized that this is my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists took place, and the new, free like me were unclear.
I began to be friends with artists new wave, with постгазоневщиной, which led to the "пушкинской-10," and more wave was not.
I throws in theatre, clothes, music, in all genres, beyond words.
"All of this объединилось in your арт-клинике..." I was important find themselves in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where should meet all the best creative forces.
In 1995 I took on пушкинской-10 territory, and there, there was no repair, existed музыкально-артистический club, a Bohemian club House st.-petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: prefectures of текила-джаз remember of a string led the project "the van Gogh's ear."
Cord and his friends sang under plywood light songs, they were in обтягивающем tights, among them was a trendy now composer Igor vdovin.
When the band has played live, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was leading many programs to хали-галивских times.
We gave them трахтенберга, and went to his great career and basic education and upbringing he we have received.
Gallery "D 137," Club "griboedov is echoes from арт-клиники.
There our employees and завсегдатаи left.
I hero yesterday's century, when culture mean something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was "the people of our City."
In the "artist of the Year" was named I ended my culmination.
The new times by the old rules uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years easily become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not really cultural.
"Your work is characterized by recognizable style.
"A lot of my pictures - it hits in them a great relevance and acuteness.
I will have software exhibition," the Russian Museum in клоунах."
Clowns - timeless category.
I used to social was now being so - it is painful and scary.
But in клоунах all spread, tragedy will be removed.
I love the grotesque, I have гротесковые ideas.
For example, saving the world by changing totalitarian in the form of an order.
Now on odezhke vstrechayut, guided by foreign mechanics, and not on the inner man.
And, maybe, his hand to file cannot be a spit need.
And deception will be filmed by dressing.
"Recently we have seen you in the role of urban шарманщика. - Cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, like me, not them to be.
"Well may and commercial art can be beautiful?
"Now commercial art should be careful and considerate, sweet.
Is disintegration of the crops.
Before people crowded together in ñòàè, La Bohème one loved простаки more.
Now all crashed on микросообщества, now it is difficult to like it all.
I am not стодолларовая paper to all like.
Now we need to think, who will be like.
Now each cult hero to 100 fans.
"And the стаса mikhailov comes to several thousand!
- брошенки come to him, сексо-социальная сфера works there.
And the cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 thousand not come, and ultimately less management, money, all чахнет.
I have fans, the most important thing is they don't cheat, do not spoil acquired.
I wrote in his youth such pictures that one collector they have on the wall next to фальком and ларионовым hung.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Now often confuse.
They say: a spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a person culture yesterday, grew by examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, abandoned the money for the sake of drawing pictures.
I for one that's culture.
"Kirill, which lacks the St Petersburg?
"Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official from the culture.
But not all of them can do culture.
With the right Tsars, all was not so, kings, cannot really understood in the culture, but they felt the need to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow now good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg, which could be experts, but they are pushed, as need higher experts who correctly will appreciate these experts and give them the way.
Now thrives вкусовщинка.
The same erarta, but they are distinguished by what they honestly say that not all modern art, we accept there are such artists, who must seek to other museums.
"What is for you - St. Petersburg?
Petersburg - this is not the Cultural Capital of Culture in Moscow, much more, there is the soil.
But on our stones of art to grow hard.
We need a cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, this is wrong.
Here is a lot of people in Europe любопытствующих. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have is this layer тонок.
We need to make a fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented in grant St. Petersburg

Give birth in space
The earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with астероидом-убийцей.
Caravans spacecraft with activities on board go in search of a spare planet.
To save Humanity, the question arises as to continue his Rod in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact these planets only two, which you can learn at least hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior fellow at the national astronomical Institute named п.к. штернберга (гаиш) Vladimir сурдин.
But if conditions more suitable for life on Mars, the temperature on the surface of Venus - 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in outer space.
Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
A half-century ago conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations grown in orbit peas are no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - getting in the orbit of insects, tiny fruit мух-дрозофил.
In 1979, the space was sent eggs перепелок to check as embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
We get the output is absolutely normal young bird.
But the further problem begins.
"The problem with the fact that this nestling should find support, he must stand on its legs and start moving," he said of the laboratory of the Institute of biomedical problems (имбп) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir сычев.
Not having found support chicks randomly around.
And after 10 hours in new-born therea ïîëíàÿ atrophy instincts.
Chicks failed to respond to light and sound.
And there was the trouble is that after four days they just died.
"And two times we вылупляли chicks, then refused, because you can't just there to work with them," concludes follows the failure of the experiment with birds in space Vladimir сычев.
The last time with animals biological "миниковчег" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
But the биоспутнике "bion" will only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with mice, which were sent to space already with the fruit.
In principle, there is not found anything supernatural.
"It was just the биоспутниках, but again - this is a unique experiment, and such research should conduct," said Vladimir сычев.
After the landing of the space of rats have offspring.
But approach the problem of reproduction directly in space until it turns out.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing, habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man is, unlike зверюшек, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create подобающий emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are not carried out.
But women in space travel for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at терешковой.
And the most precious, that have the humanity is a woman's body.
Our gull is, and no one on earth could not say whether he will continue after the flight into space.
Whether she will be able to give birth to a child after the flight.
"It is on this question no one answered," says a veteran of the rocket and space industry vakhtang vachnadze.
In June 1964, only a year after flight into space, the first женщина-космонавт Valentina терешкова gave birth to her daughter.
Father child андриян nikolayev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second женщины-космонавта Svetlana савицкой побывавшей twice in orbit and even поработавшей in open space, was born the son.
But the risk remains.
We have little налічується kosmonavtov units, which have after long flights all cost, and growing a healthy generation.
"And if more, that this is dangerous even in the orbital flights," the cosmonaut concludes, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia's Valery polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating an artificial gravity.
гидролаборатория CPC - a mandatory step in preparation for the flight.
Here in a zero плавучести astronauts working skills in outer space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults, let water and warm, but still, alien, the environment for babies - native element.
Small ихтиандры áóäòî confirm - life on the land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between what the baby is approximately 9 months from her mother in окоплодной fluid, it is easier to get on then to водичке.
In principle it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, is just 2 weeks.
"It's very little, to forget something," says swimming instructor грудничкового Marina aksenova.
In short, if a child born weightlessness more natural state, then, for women - is gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness дряхлеют muscles, pelvis, ability to falls to expel the foetus.
Oh well, skip and it is relying on stimulants ancestral activity.
You can, of course, in a special Chamber to go at birth, she will push him.
"And then what?" asks нетривиальные questions Valery polyakov.
On the other hand, a child needs artificial gravity.
Not feeling of Earth's gravity, the body will not form the skeleton and the muscle system.
Newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special нагрузочный suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will be vital.
"And this experiment, to which we will go with you, having the birth of a child in чужеродной environment, will lead to what we bring to the ground the disabled person, fully human дезадаптированного foresees," the head of the committee on bioethics имбп Ras Igor pestov.
Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a time, it will be a reality, when zemlyane on their ships head to the distant planet, which will become home to their descendants, born in space.

Public procurement industry in Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This statement Miroslav kāla, Vice President of the Supreme контрольно-ревизионного management, from an interview for the website aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but he must apply correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have," commented on the current situation kāla.
These conclusions provides a joint inspection of Czech and German authorities control.
As an example of improper practices are Peter нечаса approach to so-called шварц-системе.
Recently, the prime minister said that GDP (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs audits - is it is prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be installed in any way, and, if he is something bans, and the Prime Minister cannot match the work of the institutions, which are expected to remain check and achieve the fulfilment," concludes kāla.
At the meeting of the ревизионного Committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within which was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was it?
There is a parallel test that we started in mind, perhaps, two years ago.
Simply put, the question that European law says, how should receive government procurement, it goes on to national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All the information was collected and, even if still unfinished inspection revealed the interesting differences - in short, the legislation we have can be "accurate and infallible," but in practice we on some parameters are behind Germany.
It follows from this that it is not enough to create more and more revised rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law.
As well as this project can help you, what it means for you?
Such a joint control can contribute to efforts to stop the laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economy means getting appropriate things for a reasonable (but not always) low price, to avoid the enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.
But the fact that we do not reach, lowering the limit orders.
Perhaps this system переполнится "securities" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the restriction does not declined.
You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of legislation on public procurement.
But as функціонує control system in Germany?
There is there such an organization as our chickens (контрольно-ревизионное management) or is it works differently?
As for institutions, is there as our chickens bundesrechnungshof by on our principle, there is also the Board, is a bit different, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the powers of the similar to a certain extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a division of audit and at the level of Federal Land - in a system that differs from ours.
Brh can manage only federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at federal level calculation chambers.
As for local legislation, there is easier than we have?
In general, I wouldn't want to compare without concrete evidence, but in some respects Germany take a model, but you cannot definitely say that it is better in all.
So, because they are better with the control?
Definitely not, but again, such comparisons are not like me.
But it must be said that even the country's main face many challenges.
Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, then as reflected on your institution amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow, are the consequences?
Given that the legal force of the amendments are short, it still doesn't display in our work to control.
As we spend control in fact, it is necessary to consider some delay.
Only take this into account in the training of future inspections - we have started to use our new tool "risk detection неэкономности" through which we were taken away almost 14,000 public contracts. We have analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will come, because change restrictions, change the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will justify itself.
The problem, which can occur, that is, that the rules "ужесточатся" and it is impossible to comply with them.
The functioning of the previous rules by controlled companies intertwined with the supplier (for example, the regional operational programme - with Regional Council) is that any failure to observe the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.
Whether in such a case, tighten the law in such a way?
I don't think this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit a formal error, not trade-distorting for a solution.
This system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this path will not anywhere.
Recently, the prime minister said that GDP would not bother entrepreneurs audits of so-called шварц-системы, what does it mean?
"шварц-система" banned or allowed?
The law should be installed in any way, and, if he is something bans, and the Prime Minister cannot resist the bodies, which are expected to remain to check and achieve the fulfilment.
You can say: "we would change the law and let it," but we cannot say that we pretend that nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement has a strict rules, how and what must be formally, and rightly so. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified just because of the formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but he must apply correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have.

Shimon орнест: at concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that less than a month should be the end of the world?
This is just one of the many disturbing news, on which we, the people, so easily попадаемся.
Together with a group of the tap tap we constantly шутим on this subject and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concert against doomsday.
Could you tell us more about the readers?
It is about a national fundraising event, which we are here already within two years.
We decided to use marketing potential, which has the Mayan calendar, the end of which is announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before the event, on December 20th at 21:00 parallel runs three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They come to an end, roughly speaking, at the moment, when on the Pacific island of Kiribati, whose time zone for 12 hours before we have completed maysky calendar.
Who came up with the head of this idea?
Initially, it was my idea, we all think up together with our artist гонзой аугустой.
In addition, that we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about those in what state the world once we pass our children.
At the end of May of the schedule we have created a unique collection of objects of shoes, T-shirts, bags and original ключиков against doomsday. These things can be bought on the site www.e-tap.cz and thereby also give us support.
The group the tap tap along with other musicians also sang the anthem against Doomsday, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."
It is already fancied by listeners YouTube anthem on these бенефисных concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything will work out and the end of the world does not come.
His запоют all performers at all concerts at the same time.
Hymns simultaneously ring also live on Czech television.
Words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomasz ganac participates in the performance of the xindl X...
As you have begun to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other personae Czech cultural life, because we have many charitable events and concerts.
Try to actively use them in these projects.
It turned out that many like to work with us, interesting to them.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
The purchase of equipment for безбарьерного educational centre studeo, already the sixth year so we are working with civil îáúåäèíåíèåì tap at the Institute едлички.
Teachers regularly attend school students інституту едлички and spend with them âåñåëûå and interesting events.
The students have no money to go to the teachers, and thus we try to give them the opportunity.
In the framework of the project of additional construction Institute едлички in the future there will be a separate building, in which we переедем with this project.
At every concert nosaukšu several bands and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to make the program, which will attract all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will chinaski support lesbiens illustratosphere with даном barta, the tap tap, marjan bangor, Morbihan and Jiří souchy.
About all the details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan to any such "grandiose event" in the future?
In May, will for the first time to perform on "the Prague Spring festival" and then, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, if we will be in the United States, would like to perform in Washington, D.C. and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The group the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it looks at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their child must travel in the luggage compartment, plus to the large number of cargo and boxes with instruments.
However, while live up to this without problems. The Czech Airlines čsa and British airlines British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, what I once was.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went off without problems.
Thanks to выездам abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward disabled people and so on.
With what you were by now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where everything works better than we have in Russia, we have seen that in the East is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and here is still in the new independent przesuwanie man in an electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
Also there is shyrokovzhyvanym áàíàëüíûå things such as give way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there are already public organizations, who are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, we constantly must catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, runlevel which far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it concerns.
In London and Madrid is normal, that people with severe form of disability to move in the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, yes anywhere...
There is not much that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, in that we are with the tap tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or безбарьерность is one thing, but at the moment, when among us there will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything will change indeed.
As long as this single cases - people with a strong will.
The group the tap tap at the present time is very popular, but back on two years ago, that in 1998, you made her to organize?
I entered the Institute едлички as tutor, had a lot of young people around me, who wanted something to do.
And since I myself a musician and play the saxophone, then along with colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, but over time, as our lead ладя says angelovič, it is a bit out of control (laughs).
The popularity of the same came only in recent years, or something I путаю?
It is true, we help that we started to join the famous singers and actively working on advocacy group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess, in fact as if there is no.
Thanks to the European Union means we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Standing in front of you so well turn the tap tap target?
From the very beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things подражающей one another.
It is logical that all new taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, sorry, this naturally...
But the pity of completely излишня, because people with disabilities are not some affected and all abandoned by individuals, which we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities have something it turns out, this shift is not just for them, but for the whole society.
забезпечив whether success that you are the head of what you consider many?
If we want to do a job properly, we must be in many things бескомпромиссными and hold a certain discipline.
But I think that this is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that two times a week should go to rehearsal, to attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But as happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
At the present time in the group of the tap tap twenty people.
How many of them were in the beginning in 1998?
Only one ладя angelovič.
We open the group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
He will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the stadium incheba in Brno - the club fléda and Ostrava, in the centre of the Czech plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are телемостом in time of the song of the tap tap "the end of the world is cancelled."
The goal of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for purchasing a multifunctional безбарьерного equipment for educational centre studeo when едлички Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert is 400 crowns, for children up to 12 years free admission tickets can be purchased in advance in bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at the meeting of the ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth Member of the European Space Agency as a second country of the former eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994, and in the following years, took an active part in a number of projects agency.
But the way to space Poland began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it is not always before found with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, of lectures and. штернфельда, which on December 6, 1933, represented in Warsaw astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "introduction to cosmonautics."
Ideas of a young engineer (1905 born) left the audience only indifferent, after several years of штернфельд recalled that Dr. Jan гадомский was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France штернфельд won the prize of Robert эсно-пельтри and André Luiz хирша for "introduction to cosmonautics."
Dr. Jan гадомский (1899, 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space science.
He published in the Polish magazine wrote a number of books and hundreds of Articles devoted to this scientific disciplines.
гадомский became known worldwide propagandist space science, and his contribution was assessed in including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway draisine, equipped with missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not clear, even to disperse or braking for carriage was to be used rocket.
Information about this дрезине known only from the press of the era.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to wonder about missile стрелах.
A study by the weapons technology in collaboration with professors мечиславом вольфке and Gustav мокжицким.
Of the remaining materials research shows that come to the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops work were interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized press appeared the idea of the photovoltaic ракеты-истребителя, which offered рогозинский engineer, and the following year вийшла work "air ракета-торпеда and aviation ракета-бомба" author леливы-кживоблоцкого.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war all projects military use of missile technology was a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy), who coordinated the work.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of his work ended because of the war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to a space superpower, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society astronautics (polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 magazine "problems," which are published four long articles on астронавтике.
In one of them Professor m. суботович suggested to organize society, which will deal with космонавтикой.
At the time, already gaining momentum проекти artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is a promising industry.
Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish society astronautics (поа) tried to join the International Federation astronautics (based in 1951), and in autumn поа became its active member of.
And next year the first chairman of the поа Kazimierz заранкевич (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of astronautics.
In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956 поа contributed to the development of a highly successful meteorological missiles rm (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile выполнившей scientific study.
The first type rm-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
Rocket, capable of overcoming the distance 1800 m, was about 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently vibro rm-1а version was built, and in the summer of 1959 on бледовском two-stage missile test rm-2 somehow managed to survive were carried out.
The rocket was about 1.4 m in length, and her weight was about 11.5 pounds.
The next version of the missiles was already in a position to do this scientific work - rocket rm-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was watching the tall wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
Heiress first missiles type rm became rocket метеор-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.
The rocket was conceived as we use two level, its total length становила 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
There are three types (which are marked as метеор-1а -1в and -1с), which were split of the camera to the scientific equipment.
Rocket метеор-1а had space of 0.4 a litre, метеор-1в - 0,34 L, and метеор-1с - 0,62л.
The maximum range of flight for all three types of was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968, in the aviation Institute was the development of missiles метеор-2, and its first flight tests started in October 1970.
Rocket метеор-2 with a 380 kg, was able to cargo weighing 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then were built version метеор-2н and метеор-3.
I should also mention the accession of Poland in коспар (the Committee on space research) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee коспар two years later.
In addition, in the framework of the program interkosmos, Poland took part in the research space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav гермашевский became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir ремека.

The law on public works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The decision caused жваву дискусію in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
либерально-ориентированные economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economies, are in constant conflict with each other.
It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, no private capital limited movement along with raw financial speculation.
As a result of the significant differences in labor costs (salaries) чпъойлбеф price tension.
Under this concept should be understood condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to stand in economic competition is the fact that "" the cost of a competitor to pick up a greater part of the market, and thus increase their own income.
On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries where labor costs, compared with other high.
Because private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including and grow for manufactured them unemployment, the inevitable government spending on social needs.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of masters entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the social, economic and social damage inflicted by them in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that need no specific statistics.
Private capital бесцеремонные methods are at the level of individual economies situation, when governments are forced to engage in competition with each other to artificially reduce social level of its population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give their own population at the mercy of the private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes of the current legislation.
The goal is economically make their ​ ​ people to submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time, serves as a tool for cutting rights of workers in the field of labour legislation.
As a result of the increased level of poverty and, together with the and the difference between rich and poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany for a few years there is public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves their own labor.
The number of these people are already approaching one million.
Within the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy are constantly cases when трудоустроенные people get a salary, that the state should they доплачивать so that they received прожитковий мінімум.
A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern States of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same state, in which people who are under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on нищенскую salary on the margins of society in the hope that one day in the country will come private investment capital.
But it's asked, how did he take?
If the funds will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, марокканец египтянин African still works for a share of European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to nausea, argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not morontia actions to intervene in the economy.
Then you should answer the question is not whether private capital, now almost хртбчмсаэйк policy and to the entire state, in its own selfish purposes?
A clear answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of the almighty and omnipresent lobby in almost all countries.
As a result we have a hopeless situation, проявляющуюся in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany the situation is such that public ministry due to lack of funds is assigned to develop bills private law firms, which are tightly linked with industry.
Then these bills argues the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, according to the constitution of the Western type, and from финансово-мощных groups who want their own interests.
It is obvious that либерально-ориентированная democracy now quickly turns out to be in such a ​ ​ situation, as described аппианом in work "the crisis of the Roman empire in the days of Caesar and pompéia": "the state has long been disintegrated, and agencies are involved in violence.
Bribes, illegal receiving handouts with stones and swords.
Bribery and Corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people walked in the election with zaranee sold voice... "" decent people are generally not of them ran for the office of the governor, at the end of the day once the state for eight months left without consul.... "" seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the necessity of finding an energetic person.. appian thought that it would be "pompey, but they became Caesar that finally changed democracy to autocracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital, already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: repair the unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character.
It means that the cause of the fascist and communist regimes we should look for the reckless economic liberalization systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of democracy liberal type can be seen as a pause, after which is expected to be the next tour.
First of all, tragically, that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe, which we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition both on the international and at national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic in nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen share state involvement in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the government and private capital will weaken a monopoly position in society in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory chaos.
"The violence will be released, and nothing can never go out" - sting, the song "fragile," where the verse рефрена are the words: "Don't forget what we fragile."
"If my sons did not want war, they would not be" - умирающая гутель шнапер, wife меера амшела Rothschild.
The recent wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has caused a lot of responses.
Some are opting for Israel, defending his position in that it has the right to defend itself, and the Palestinians are in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, defending the racism of the Israeli State, genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel has been attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to speculate about who in these periodically recurring waves killings, criminal, and whoever the victim, after all, today's Israeli citizens, including самоуправляемые territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and not witnessed the violence began.
My goal is to offer readers to look behind the curtain, you look at it, who primarily serve which continues for 95 years of tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning backed by historical facts, some of them out on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of modern history.
The history of mankind is first of all the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great and Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people are themselves taking their own steps, or for their throne was someone who has guided their actions to advance the set goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and проистекающей of these authorities could not happen for the life of one generation.
Among астрономически rich families is one that could be viewed as голова спрута (do not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds.
Many do not write about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 1990s, 19th century, to stop rumors linking their name with criminal actions in higher areas, in the shadow of which they were, and who have always led to strengthen their power, приумножению wealth or at the same time and by then, and to the other.
They are stakes in almost all central banks around the world, and against the countries, in whose central banks, they don't have their share of, they do or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the ouster of Qaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has committed his country's central bank in their own hands).
Anyone who has tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the Central Bank for ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the Civil War, he began to produce their own (понимай - government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. deputy Luis mcfadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for a world power in the period from 1859 in 1871 led to developing the plan of three world wars, created by the great Mason 33rd level Al пайком.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and a third should lead to reduce world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (a number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything else, except as a prerequisite for such a project) and the final capture of absolute power.
A method by which has a team of the richest families headed by ротшильдами, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao - order out of the chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which is supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis, caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing габсбургского heir Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, by Bolshevik революциию.
The First World War ended a sudden, unjustified in warrior and economically капитуляцией Germany (there was no longer necessary war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of central European powers, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the unleashing of the Second World War, bankers and policymakers have created a latent conflict situation, once in Germany huge war reparations, which created the background to radicalization of impoverished masses, then was only given the Germans are strong, обличающего guilty and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played function fifth column, in sparking the fire of war.
In the late 19th century Rothschilds provoked a foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Jews with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The declaration of the Balfour Declaration created a premise of the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to be the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to estimate, released the Hitler of chains, in which his holding bankers, or whatever he did was originally planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews to concentration camps have created conditions for recognition of the Jewish state the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, just as Germany was caused by the military репарациями on 2-ю World War II, the state of Israel was proclaimed a war, to create the third.
If the international bankers would unleash the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, it will become a victim of fighting on the front lines, now together with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp divide people on supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is a victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the insult breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their commitment to the global power?
We must distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like the US, international bankers подсовывают people for voting in the election solely its own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu Hawk is a typical example of fascist, loyal international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the ормузским strait, containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (ship corridor is just 2 miles wide)," also will lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In which light now are words, spoken by David рокфеллером in 1994: "all that we need is a crisis, and people will take a new world order."
The new world order in their view is the world masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy наслаждающейся comfort.
World where everyone born the body at birth имплантируют chip, with whom he becomes the creature, which is under total control.
"And makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have on his right hand or on the forehead of the stigma, so that a person who is marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could not buy or sell.
This is the wisdom: anyone who has the mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For is it name human, and the number is six hundred sixty six.

The film "operation" ARGO ": when worse could cause Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed резы shāh, an escaped after the revolution in the United States, which had been the patron saint of his regime for decades.
The US administration for the positive outcome of the situation not предполагался - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
But to achieve liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to a теократического regime, she was not able to.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was reinforced by the unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after talks brokered by the Algerian Government.
Their fate has brought home a wave of solidarity and антииранских sentiment.
Defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election 1980-го року, completed election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, срежессированный actor Ben affleck "operation" ARGO "describes one of the episodes of the history, which brought America small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape.
After the complex changes they finished their way to the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities managed to take them away from Iran, while helped экстравагантная legend cover, according to which they went to Canadian паспортам as members of the crew, подыскивавшие place in the country for filming научно-фантастической epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert "evacuation" Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation of Hollywood.
To the legend was reliable, in journals wrote about the film project, устраивались press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept a secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The film аффлека is a combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "фильм-киноопус," the story of a successful затеи, fraud is an example can be a number of films about the ocean's friends.
The film is constantly changing mood - on the one hand, documented задуманные scenes of Tehran's (the титрах shows significant historical photos of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the film, big differences in this not).
On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, пересекающиеся with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating table, the stairs institutions, on the phone...
Ben аффлеку admirationful managed to make рестарт career.
From высмеянного actor has become a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation" ARGO "his third feature film, after dark detective" farewell, baby, goodbye "(2007) and the thriller" the city "(2010).
At the same time, this is the first film аффлека, which remains in the hometown of director - Boston.
A sense of atmosphere places in this refers to the qualities that возвышали earlier films directed by over Hollywood standard.
And affleck it manifests in "ARGO," where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in reconstruction of real events - entrance scenes of the embassy impressive its clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and непредвиденности, which arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.
A similar effect affleck and his colleagues are in scenes of fictional (a fake headquarters at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply a variety of exciting scenes cinematographic values.
He is quite successfully working with this little, sometimes something додумывает - there's all this goes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents a looming crisis in Tehran's airport and the race on взлетно-посадочной lane look rather надуманно).
The lack of "ARGO" is рассеянность, associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved a larger space, as they do in the film is far from the only.
Film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, this is a film, which you can watch with moderate interest, assessing performance and ретро-стиль воссоздающий триллеры seventies.
But captures with difficulty.
However, this is enough for the reminder of the one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated notions of almighty and всезнающих special services.

The rules of the asset air-balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com each year, performing a poll about the most absurd banking fees, now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd decision or project from EU workshop."
"We made to this last event, in which the EU plans to take 40-процентную quota for women in the major European companies," said "law" організатор questionnaire Patrick нагер.
Among the previously put forward by the nomination абсурдностей - the recent decision of the European Court on the premium rates for men and women.
Until now, women had privileges on life insurance, because they objectively for insurance companies are less prone to risk.
"Further incredible ideas from EU workshop people can advance to the contest before the end of the year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," said нагер.
The controversial resolutions of the EU is, for example, and compulsory adding биокомпонентов in fuel, that result in harm nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury градусников only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of cages for chickens, with the result that this year, significantly tightened eggs.
The criticism was a de facto ban on the use of the term "бутербродное oil" or withdrawal from sale of classical light bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 inches long.
Pan-European device often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any State or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under threat for defends requirements of its banks).
The lobby is: for example, top quality bananas in the European Union must have been achieved in 14 cm in length and not dare show "аномальную кривизну."
At the same time the European Commission оправдывалась that only harmonizes existing scattered national rules that осложняли trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, still has softened standards on the fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to расточению products.
A candidate to win in the poll may become and last year the EU, according to which sold balloons should снабжаться warning that children under eight years cannot inflated them without adult supervision.
The EU has asked the American research, in accordance with which balloons in the game are potential cause of death by suffocation.
This restriction now apply to children under 14 years old, which is forbidden to blow in the trade fair дуделки.
Funny ideas are born and at home
It is absurd and rule, concerning the European officials: anyone who has any official position in the EU, cannot, given the considerate themes for Greece, using the name Macedonia, but must instead say "бюрм" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "principle of non-interference" (admire make), proposed for voting, apart from a few above the absurd rules, for example, a rule about the amount of food in the EU membership of the state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies, which can stay in the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently the Czech Republic topped, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a big fine.
Organizers of the questionnaire also are interested in and the idea to pay for some countries for the fact that they have no sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for a statement about getting subsidies.
But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea.
The European Union will ask about compensation," said in the fall of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture jaraslau palace (чсдп).
As the argument he pointed out that the country had a high grain yield, and as a result of the so-called интервенционных purchases of the state was full of warehouses stocks, which had to be taken.
For the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to паласу, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission has gone to the Czech Republic, organizing a tender to buy grain from the countries, which have no access to the sea.
Subsidies to obtain subsidies offered ñåëàì Ministry for regional development, руководимое Minister Paul German (us-deu), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on making statements on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: bizarre orders are the exception
While the resolution in the Member States can easily become an object of criticism, the efforts of the EU for regulation, as well as a more efficient functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is черпание EU subsidies for projects that have not even hint at something in common with the deepening of the European integration, but which Member States have achieved when discussing the budget.
Causes emotions among Czechs and that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.
While the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and австрийцами retained the name "оломоуцкие сырки," but "туземский rum," whose tradition in our country have roots in the 19th century, our producers were to rename the "туземак."
Called rum can only products from тростникового дистиллята, not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "фета" and "gorgonzola," марципаном from German Lübeck or пармской ham, have proved to be, for example, karlovy vary breadcrumbs, погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and saaz hops.
The trademark of the EU can be proud of pardubice carrots and горжицкие tubes.

People want to have preserved the Republic, but I am an amateur," said окамура.
Mr. Senator, as a person comes to mind running for president?
I don't think about how to become the Senator or President.
If we had everything in the country function without problems, then I wouldn't be anywhere was running.
But I can no longer watch over the last 20 years the country разворовывается scurrying around the thieves, as here, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like it, then try to find a solution, as it is to change.
And since I was four years old and I am an independent person, not belonging to any party, I don't have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of Senator or President.
In the Senate, you have got, but soon went to the castle.
Do you not turn this way back to people who you choose?
I say all the time that включусь in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate.
Later, I said that if I am elected Senator, I will run for president.
My goal is not a post office is a tool with which I can carry out their views.
So I need the greatest influence and vast powers.
But the problem is not just that we as a nation ропщем have themselves in the bar or the TV, but at the same time ready растоптать any who try to change something.
Are added to the media, which human очерняют, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, about me saying that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiří пароубека.
Let's get to your views.
Struggle for the castle you started with theses about material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the inverse property declarations worth more than twenty million.
To do this, we need to change the law.
You have as a President no such powers, and only a Senate may propose laws.
As you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied that all excursions became free enterprise, it managed to push.
The problem is политиканстве - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately repaired obstacles, and this holds citizens.
As an independent беспартийного person I have much greater potential for getting support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I have no party раскладывания through, without looking at the tenets of its can take each party what is best for our country, and to apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or to the left?
With the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to me left.
Not at all important for me is a little left or a little right.
For me, it is important that we went forward.
It is not about what someone refers to the right, and some on the left, I want to unite people.
I always support any good for society decision whether he will offer кпчм or GDP, and I will just against bad ideas.
You're angry, when someone says you populist.
But do you not prove that what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you try to come close to it.
You can call it populism, but all proposals, of which I speak, already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say.
But without the support of Parliament you will remain only slogans.
And with that in politics you long not продержитесь.
Or do you think that when you exit to people and talk to them, then you will be able to implement criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have another opportunity.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on his side, so we have made his.
If I was elected president, it was not an issue to organize direct television broadcast, in which I shall refer to the chairmen of parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to explain why this does not want.
If there is a strong personality, which repeat abuses, it will put pressure on the political scene.
Take direct presidential elections - it was a credit to pressure from the public.
Speak directly, that I am an amateur, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I only a beginner in politics, and for its program to try to get a majority.
Things I am trying to promote themselves; if it fails, after six years of close and return to the private sector.
This is partly sounds as if окамура should save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that one I will do nothing, so I went around a number of famous people with a proposal from running in the Senate.
I went to радиму янчуре, he refused in connection with a lot of work.
I also supported at least a leading journalist Jan лоренцову investigation, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward his candidacy because people really неудовлетворены, but now I feel on balance.
Sixty percent of people do not go to the elections, and the majority of those who went chose representatives of the establishment.
US independent in the Senate only two.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be carried out with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of Mayors and governors.
Do you think about the basis of their own party?
I haven't thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past each potential advocate, and I have no money on this.
There is no money and in the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand Crowns.
You have no money?
You talk about property declarations, and how is your own business with it?
Personal property is valued at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot of land in Prague worth approximately 25 million apartment on 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, the collection of works of art by about 10 million астон-мартин to 3.5 million and škoda суперб million, and even a few million on the account.
By the way астон-мартин I have appeared, because it was my мальчишечья dream - I always liked джэймс bond, which travelled by car, was галантен with women and, at the same time, he fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You ride a астон-мартине, own property on 60 million and you have no money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money especially to invest in it do not want to.
This is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
I should get into debt?
I invested in a campaign already 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have sponsors, shows that my program not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.
Spending on campaign I essentially cover сенаторская salary.
The money but I wouldn't have lived, for example, could not pay his son for the English school, which is 30 thousand a month.
If I wanted to make money, so there would not only ran.
It means, then you will be doing business, to live?
Don't you have said that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, their activities I partially reduced.
For example, managing director of travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like to, that I was бессребренником, which will keep the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How many, as an entrepreneur, you are used to on a monthly basis?
From two to four hundred thousand, to receive and further.
And if I became President, then his business would end.
The full interview you will find in субботнем asterisk-addons newspaper "right."

Architects mvrdv argue that the real adventures are not only in the popular imagination - for example spijkenisse and his recently constructed book mountain - 2 photos
"I thought this building fun, it looks футуристично, finally we have again you can see something interesting," says лизетте верхайг прохожая on the edge of the road.
But Stefan спермон, an expert on it on building located near a large company, believes so: "No, it's really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
All have the Internet, iPad and electronic books.
Now nobody voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned library, right?
Spijkenisse, малопримечательному спальному camp under the following ports: Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
It has a population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this frustrating circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to make a contribution in general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of a spectacularly colored miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library here!
вини Maas of Rotterdam architectural Bureau mvrdv, master of bold столбчатых diagrams and author of the witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, public to the task with his usual невозмутимостью and appeared on a competitive listening in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smirk on his face.
And as long as the members of the jury озадаченно looked and shrugged, naughty Maas folded from its original gift пирамидку in size and completed it in defense of his project the following words: "dear citizens!"
Here's my proposal: "book mountain" in spijkenisse, the so-called букенберг!
Nine years later, this mountain cost 30 million euros grew.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, mail and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses in total for 50 apartments.
In early November," book mountain "was awarded the second prize of the" best library potuyt 2012. "
The project also participates in the national Dutch конкурсі wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything but the postmodern pedestrian zones and surprisingly homely town hall, the white facades which suggest the idea of молокозаводе became richer at one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important thing - in spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.
The long road to the book
First impression: книжное Eldorado under the boy in the plastic bubble for cheese.
There is only one elevator, taking place in the center of the architecture, because these fans and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.
остекленное from all sides room is bright and easily обозримое floors of baked bricks and elegant street lamps accurately provide a sense of public town square.
Urban environment recreated ideal.
View unwittingly looking for the bench, dogs and playing the football of boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually bookshelves are along the facade, and in the middle is a dark room, usually неуютный and faceless," says вини Maas.
We have a classic configuration space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out.
The inner space of book mountains used skillfully: in the center of the offices are located, интернет-библиотека, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities.
Especially glad with black bookshelves, which serve the finish of the walls, then the парапетами, лестничными railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell the unusual.
Even sophisticated civil engineers and architects are lost in guessing, what is the unknown material.
"We were eager to work with secondary materials," explains joop трауборст, head of the project, representing the Community spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a single аграрному enterprise in Friesland we met the by-product of the agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and on the fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots is an artificial волокнистый material миллиметровой thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
The thin textilien serves as a season or two, then it can be to throw out.
For the library this painting - for the first time in such amounts - was спрессовано in the four centimeter thick.
Under the influence of the heat and pressure the so-called ландбаупластик (klp) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, the smell is a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
At the top are 105 steps.
The one who wins over the path length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary CAFE is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also Dutch крокетами and well as trade of its фикусами in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and primarily about the right humidity on literary mountain.
The cost of a new Soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of ecology," says троуборст.
Heat is used for the heating and cooling of the earth.
Although book mountain is under a glass boy in the plastic bubble, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.
Large farms of клееной wood, placed perpendicular стеклянному facade, provide shade and take up most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection provide fully automatic rolling curtains.
Stefan спермон aforesaid skeptic of areas of it, has already visited the new library.
лизетте верхайг also was already here.
As well as преподавательница traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia bogarde, which called букенберг "soul spijkenisse, which has long been lacking."
The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to sacrifice one book from their own meetings.
These books were to occupy the empty space on the shelves is not yet fully укомплектованной library - at the time it was 70.000 books.
The idea worked.
Shelves заставлены up.
"There is nothing worse than полупустая library," says the architect вини Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way connected with the new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
Even if it is only for decoration.
Thus, mvrdv managed to solve Royal task, which on the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.
And they are very young and необразованны.
It is only the starting point for building identity.

Szabo: "The Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to the стефена szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin balanced on a narrow the diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinian application to receive observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen szabo: Germany does not support the actions of Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany should be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position, it also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - while not acting too critical toward Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on a forbidden zone for flights.
As a result, NATO held this proposal.
Germany is hard to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of its foreign policy, namely passes from the policy, which, so to speak, led us to the German foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent edinaya policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that while they only 8 of their role, but are on the way to "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy which is France or Britain.
What exactly is "normal" with German foreign policy point of view?
This willingness to take in its national interest position, unaffected by the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is from exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are largely from the interests of other major countries, and that's why Germany must defend their interests.
Whether these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf States.
So it must be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it is not completely one-way communication.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, воздерживаясь when making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States positieve understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was the same dramatic надлом, as in the Libyan issue.
Germany may even become so a certain respect.
It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that with its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European states?
The power of American domestic politics such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has sufficient understanding of deep inside the European position.
But in connection with the local political situation of the government, of course, cannot openly to hold such a position.
I believe that substantial differences of opinion is not as great as always seems to be.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not delighted by Netanyahu policies.
Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that is what makes the situation a difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there were a single, a consistent European policy, but now it is not so.
So they cannot act in the broader approach and are forced to act, instead relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That's the way they do with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in building a common European position.
It is clear that it is not easy for Germany, at least because of ties with Israel.
This theme was always delicate.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player - whether she would take on a really major role?
Or a leading role still difficult given Germany?
Germany has not got used to it, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far always difficult is to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany takes on a role, are very different антигерманские feelings.
The Germans not just deal with it.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view Germany is considerably more difficulties than the United States.
It must take into account the different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
So, the influence of the United States in European politics constantly weakens, but at the moment the EU is not filled the vacuum, who then?
The Germans would just have to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like, unpleasant or increases the enmity to you - that's just life.

"The protection of trademarks in China:" When PUMA and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is internationally known brand, Polo Ralph lauren, too.
But what is the Armani Polo?
It is completely officially registered name which has nothing to do with companies in China, from the names of which it formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not be the case.
But then it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"Foreigners is becoming harder to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas паттлох, Taylor's lawyer wessing, specializing in the trademark rights violations in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears on the new case of this kind.
имитаторам enough to add just a few letters, to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci виходить lu-gucci, instead of Prada can be registered prada-kny.
The same way legally copied German enterprises, such as sporting goods manufacturer PUMA.
паттлох opens the folder with records відомства registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered the trademark zegna df PUMA, artificial name, in which used the name of the fashion house ermenegildo zegna.
The fact that the Chinese - world champions on copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is well known.
In the big cities there is a multilevel department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However справи паттлоха not such. On behalf of their clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises are officially received from відомства registration of trademarks right to use the name, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "banne минпай" марка-пассажир.
This word is associated with "banne дакуань."
So called women who are hunting for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame
"It damages the business, with the need to fight," óáåæäåí паттлох.
"While trademark, a unique position is lost, image suffered tremendously."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive копируемых products.
According to the company by market research clsa, China, with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest and the fastest growing market for luxury goods.
But to remove shady records in the register trademarks is difficult, and is it's expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcomes.
паттлох tells about matters, in which the Court rejected claims, as at the end of a long time опротестованное name became "reality of the market."
If the complainant not lucky, he will have to pay even плагиатору, as a damaged the his trade sign in China, says паттлох.
Sometimes there is governed by the law of the jungle.
There is also the famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009 the company Daimler lost a court dispute with manufacturers of construction machinery sany, enterprise, which shortly before acquired фирму-производителя бетононасосов putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star Mercedes.
купившая Volvo company Geely originally used сине-белый logo, напоминавший BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China имитаторам from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way.
Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.
The registration of trademarks ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and equipment приміщення there had been difficulties.
But in the past year was "return from an emergency situation in the process to normal."
So, the number of rough affairs возражениям decreased by 22 percent.
It was closed almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production department.
To deal with this is expensive
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year the ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications on the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record and means that China for the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations worldwide, the agency reports.
The same goes for total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.
In 2011 was paid out 1.8 billion yuan fees.
If simplify, this means that each Registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Appeal against it is worth many times more, as it shows the German family enterprises freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the concern is fighting against the Chinese плагиатора.
The Germans have managed to ensure that the illegal production of them fake auto parts was defeated.
But copycat secured a Chinese rights to trademark freudenberg.
It was their own omission, since the names in Germany are not subject to protection, says hanno вентцлер, chairman of the board of freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.
And the registration of trademarks ctmo rejected the claim мюнхенцев.
However, in both the following entities freudenberg won, but nasty party continues to struggle so far.
You need to be on the alert
Now the question is pending in the Supreme Court.
вентцлер hopes to bring it to a conclusion and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But he also said: "the process is extremely expensive and we take a lot of time, money and nerves."
Domestic spending is unlikely to succumb to the accounting firm, the archive had to view even acts of a hundred years old, to give evidence.
Five years ago freudenberg no results suggested the loathly side of the "great шестизначную amount in euro" for settlement.
"It is clear how costly it we should," says вентцлер.
Dangers of Far East threatened to break out even in Europe.
Namely, if imitation of зарегистрируют there for an unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name freudenberg for footwear and leather goods.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent registration.
"We need to be on the alert," says вентцлер.
Both he and the lawyer паттлох recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should be "anything that in any way is to protect, to register also in China," says вентцлер.
Otherwise it can do much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about a sign, you will have to pay the loathly side licensing fees for its own name, explains вентцлер.
Otherwise we will from the market in the dark segment.

World AIDS Day: притоптывать, to sing, to help
In хайдельберге preparing choir имбонги - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are happy with it.
The history of relations, overcome the distance more 8733 kilometers.
First heard stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, men's and women's лодочки тапки looks for a bar on паркетном floor and quickly find him.
раз-два-три-четыре.
Only then slowly increase the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they occur, charm and follow each other.
And фите hopf, 29-летний conductor, almost POPs out of their матерчатых shoes, when leads them flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the musical hall of the Institute of medical psychology at хайдельберге choir имбонги preparing a new song.
The choir rehearsal came fifty participants from 23 to 69 years, from специалистки on human genetics to the Porter.
"Om" обани "is not an easy thing, every voice choir has its own text, in addition to a whole чуждом: зулусском language, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, there are about 34 million people living with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland has a population of 245 million AIDS orphans.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population вич-положительны.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village эситжени association voices for Africa was шефов in Germany.
70 of them attend school, готовящую to further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch in гого-центре.
имбонги on зулусском language means a narrator or восхвалитель.
In this room don't speak fluently on the Bantu, but can sing.
Nearly ten years the choir разучивает songs on this another soft language and from time to time even takes them back to where they first appeared: to South Africa.
Summer адже 8733 miles away from the 325 heidelberga, in northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village эситжени, which depends on the votes of the German Choir.
Infected forty percent
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus ич.
In эситжени in miniature reflected the disease of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which proved reduces the risk of infection by half, among the population almost not accepted.
More than 40 percent of the population of Swaziland are in themselves immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth 10 - not uncommon.
Choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before participants имбогни saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but just the: food, clothing, education.
Without school education a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first it was an obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him an opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later choir founded the association "voices for Africa," which has since almost professionally takes care of AIDS orphans in эситжени.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important, sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI as syphilis, Chlamydia and триппер (гонорею).
Frequent viral stds are HIV, the human папиллома-вирус, genital herpes and hepatitis.
лобковый педикулез and scabies refer to паразитарным stis.
What are the main поражаемые group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea found mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sex between men.
The heterosexual adults often встречающимися diseases, passed sexually transmitted infection, are хламидийные трихомониаз candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human папиллома-вирус.
The spread of HIV among the heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among the youth хламидийные infection are significantly more often than among other groups.
According to European, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have among young people also often found human папиллома-вирус.
As change the number of cases of infection?
Not all, sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, has more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007 reduced.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth lower than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to венерическое disease?
When infectious diseases may arise ulcers in the field of genital mutilation, complaints by мочеиспускании чщдемеойс, abdominal pain at the bottom, as well as the bubbles or sealing.
But often they are not accompanied by migraine and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
It is partly the bacteria sexually transmitted diseases, can also spread through contact infection and in close physical contact.
That's why experts recommend regular inspection, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early detection can cure most stis and avoid remote consequences.
Patronage, choir and not least fees for speeches throughout Germany allow something to collect donations.
"All we were sent to эситжени already about 200 000 euros," says аннете леннартц, Chairman of the Association.
In the village of money from Germany manages цодва Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
She also cares about making orphans were well organized, for example in one of the grandmothers.
гогос, as they are known in зулусском old women, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took to himself to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and take care of that children in the form of every day in time appeared on the lessons.
Those who have not left home, go to the shelter to ханийсиле, lonely woman, receives a salary from associations, as well as two cook, who every day are preparing for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the association "voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, constructed two курятника and together with American Health Organization for PSI organized surrender analysis on HIV for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefer deep silence.
The King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says аннете леннартц, "because it is associated with sexuality."
Quite unusual for a country in which the King has officially 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King mswati III, is known for its love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on such a санкционированном державою style of life also lays the blame for what ич virus has spread so quickly in the past years.
But she is also a stray workers who carry the virus in the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says аннете леннартц," but they almost do not use.
Another culture - the flesh to flesh."
To a little support cultural exchange, choir ибмогни every two or three years is travelling to South Africa and singing songs, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many in the South region of the black continent know since the days of apartheid.
The bus, full of White, who sing songs on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even that has happened, there were tears in the eyes of the border guards.
The trip also always results in эситжени, where singers відвідують sponsored children.
In spite of the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the valley of эцулвени it more than known.
"Go in эситжени, there is light," say the people here. "
But after 8733-километрового flight back in Heidelberg, when топающие singers return to репетиционный facilities on the street бергхаймер, you can see that this light burns here as well.

Client: NASA opens up ice on mercury
The probe "client" found evidence that the planet mercury is ice.
The ice cover can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
US Space Agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also the frozen water, according to a three studies, published on Thursday in a special journal Science.
The probe "client" found evidence that is constantly in the shadow of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Supposedly, the water comes from a comet or, perhaps, the asteroid, confronted with retrograde.
No one connects the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said supervisor of the probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature at mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these findings could help explain how water and other construction elements of life are in other places in the solar system.
Out of the spotlight for inhabitants of the earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example," Phoenix," explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they are sent to earth images: small окошки in endless gave.
The image comes from the camera, which developed the German researchers from the Max planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet ceres.
As Pluto, which turns around the sun beyond Neptune, ceres, on a new definition of the international astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet."

Depending on the color photos of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory photo shows the remote for a few thousand light-years трифид nebula in the constellation sagittarius.
The name трифид comes from the Latin word trifidus (трехдольный трехраздельный), as dark бреговата dust is divided into three parts раскаленное heart the cradle of the stars.
In the constellation ophiuchus astronomers photographed a harbinger of Cosmic Collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from earth kernel-mode two сливающихся galaxies blow towards each other and inevitably face.
This is the birth of stars telescope Hubble took off a spiral galaxy m83.
Those who do not like technical reduction, can call her nicknamed "the southern цевочное wheel."
Space telescope Hubble photo shows a fragment of the nebula Iris in the constellation cepheus.
Nebula located at 1400 light years, consists of dust particles of dust, whose size from 10 to 100 times less than the normal home.
This image was made of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows the ring of black holes, remote to 430 million light years from earth.
This group of galaxies called arp 273 photographed for NASA's Hubble space telescope.
A spiral galaxy scientists call was ugc 1810.
In this star nebula is the most spectacular group of new stars of our Milky Way.
Star колыбель constantly creates new stars.
The starry cloud, coupled with туманностью outlet, also constantly creates new stars - at a distance of 5,000 light years from earth.
In the brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole מחט dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe is mainly a hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 5,490 році Hannes липперсгеем Galileo Galilei - even before a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, mirrors optical telescopes became more and more - and their view of space available deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, telescope "haale, Germany" in the Observatory El palomar, Valencia under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, shown here, was the diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, a "large binocular telescope."
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Grand телескопио canarias" has a giant inner device - the diameter of a single mirror is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of South African telescopium in South Africa сегментировано - to reduce the price.
However in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
Lack of inexpensive constructive performance: telescopium seal at a vertical angle is strictly limited its mobility.
Telescope "хобби-эберли" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His feature: high светособирающая ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirror parameters - the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope at arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to terrestrial signals in space.
радиотелескоп has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the "search for extraterrestrial intelligence (seti) project, any computer owner can help, giving its computing capacity.
View of the European Observatory astronomical services (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
"There is a very large telescope" is entirely appropriate to his name.
His four mirrors to cover in the visual chimney even average infrared spectrum.
The Chilean Observatory ESO also planned to set the European "Very Large Telescope."
Its main mirror should раскинуться by as much as 42 meters - and will be drawn up from nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
But photos should expect no earlier than 2018.
Until 2007 both telescopium "кек" in Hawaiian top of a volcano мауна KEA were the largest in the world.
There are two mirror diameter of ten meters.
Telescopes "кек" are part of the Mauna KEA Observatory, which along with them looking at the sky also using telescopes "subaru" and irttf.
In addition, a new giant telescope on Mauna KEA to appear - with a mirror with a diameter of 30 meters.
Here they can admire the illustrations.
But the most important species from space delivers the Hubble space telescope.
On April 24, 1990, he delivers картины далеких worlds.
Since March 2009," Kepler space telescope "looking for planets outside the solar system - first of all, on which such possible life.
February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235 планет-кандидатов was discovered with the mission.
The pictures depicted the last cooking space telescope "Kepler."
James Webb space telescope (jwst) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 missiles on board "ARIANE 5."
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it has the light of the first stars and galaxies to search for a big explosion.
The scientists suggest that at the South Pole of mercury is ice.
But no reliable data about this, as "client" moves closer to the North Pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades, pointed out that the mercury is ice.
Thanks to запущенному in 2004 зонду "client" - the first, which revolves around mercury - scientists now sure.

Many residents in southern Azerbaijan reach по-библейски respectable age.
Even here there is a museum of longevity.
Search desires in a country where 97-летние old men are still relatively young.
A trip through the talysh mountains can be called the wild and romantic.
Minibus with громыханием rolls on the winding road past overgrown dense forest hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
All around that green and bright, one might think, if you are in the Black Forest.
But it is the southern region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few miles away.
Live here талыши - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which knows a little, except that they are perfectly speak Farsi and азербайжданском and longevity.
The final point is лерик.
A small town flaunts too тяжеловесной architecture of the Soviet era, which is not attuned to the beautiful mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too утомительна.
The 323 kmі takes eight hours, as the road has only one lane.
Legendary wealth, which the country is obliged to oil from the Caspian Sea, here in the province until добралось.
But Pilate фатулаева (48) is convinced that in лерике have than to attract tourists.
"In May, Baku has become famous for a festival of song contest - and the next year we have held the festival of the oldest people in the world," says фатулаева.
She is Director of the Museum of longevity, probably, only one in the world.
It documented a biography about eight dozen talyshs of these places, which more than 100 years. фатулаева points to a black and white photo.
It is my grandfather, he is 120 years.
In the age of 136 years he had another child was born
But the controversial star of the museum is a sheep herder ширали мюслюмов, which allegedly was 168 years.
Birth certificates, however, is not.
And, given that the oldest man, whose age was confirmed documents, turned 122 years, age мюслюмова seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains фатулаева.
A man has been married three times, and he had 23 of the child, in the age of 136 years he had allegedly was born the daughter.
So if a sheep herder мюслюмов added a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, researcher at the age of the Max planck Institute in Rostock, heard about долгожителях in Central Asia.
"It is striking a lot of people of advanced age can be found in some areas of China, also in Japan or in the valley хунза in Pakistan," said Scholz, "in Sardinia also lived very many very old people."
However, due to the lack of documents scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no registry civil status.
Every day, a glass of baked oil
However, there is the fact that people in the area of the лерика shockingly often reach biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over 100 years old.
Why here, in the south, so many centenarians?
The guide Farid мугимзаде explains the specific genes talyshs.
Director of the museum фатулаева, on the contrary, believes that the case in nutrition.
талыши like meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them drink on стакану baked oil every day. But this высококалорийная diet can hardly be healthy with диетологической point of view.
Or the primitive way of life, which keeps people youth? In ченгемиране, a tiny village near the town of лерик, lives рубаба мирзоева.
In 97 years she still relatively young for these latitudes.
мирзаева, which says that she has 143 бывший, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with бочкой oils, which tirelessly катает back and forth.

She always ate only that has grown in its own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, vicia.
For all my life I have never bought products in the store.
Then she talks about her husband, who had served in the army.
Heavier was just after the Second World War.
But it has become better, when the "favorite" father Heydar Aliyev, stood at the helm.
Propaganda is often sounds in the speech of the old woman.
But the cult figures, created by the father of the nation, which rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then the reins of power took his son Ilham.
However among Azerbaijani elders there is poverty.

And, perhaps, has long been raised son мирзаевой also right: "the old men in our culture are deep respect."

The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
The revolution was back in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo are evidence of a deep schism in the country.
A future Constitution, based on Sharia, met furious rebuffed.
The Egyptian President not скупился on pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And its success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was converted to the people, but in the first place to Christian коптам, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and нерелигиозным Egyptians.
After all, they still hopelessly разобщенные in растерянной opposition, feel fear.
Fear of religious state on the Nile at the mercy of powerful "Muslim Brotherhood."
Mohamed morsi, almost apologizing, said he temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and has expanded its competence," in order to save the Revolution."
But that actually wants to save 61-летний engineer, with a degree of doctor of the American University of southern California, it is not quite clear to Egyptians and the rest of the world.
Whether ëèøåíà force judiciary?
In fact, 234 articles managed to get provincial in nohnoy 15-часовой jump with obstacles on исламистски configured Constitutional Assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly concerns.
As in previous constitutions, the project says that trial is based on the principles of Islamic law"."
But what does it mean to "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is possible to fear that Islamists will use расплывчатую formulation and arising in connection with her legal wiggle room here for more strict interpretation of Sharia law.
At least for this suggests one нововведенная article: in all matters relating to the Sharia law, should involve for the Council of university аль-ашар, crucial Islamist institution of the country, who uses great prestige in the Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversight of the legislation, which would have had de facto säuregrads limitation of the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution much is a matter of interpretation
Another problem: should preserve venue civilians a military court.
These courts in the power of Mubarak served to suppress opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family," and "to maintain its morals and values."
Legally it is formulated so vague that public institutions with this Article will be able to control even the contents of the film and literature.
Open text this means nothing but censorship.
Generally no article sets the right equality of men and women.
But another prohibits insult and denigrate the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is insulting and how it should be, it remains unclear.
Also questionable is the wording, which is not "insulting people."
There will be enough cartoons on the President or jokes about правоведа?
The question of interpretation, as much in this project, which morsi has a signature and who, in his words," very soon "will be presented to Egyptians to a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For several weeks is formed the opposition against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual единодушии Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and have vowed to destroy the document before it can come into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we shall overcome," said хамдин саббахи, which took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei, said that the draft Constitution place "on the landfill of History."
Through the short news Twitter he accused supporters of morsi in desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and скинем his," said oppositionist Yasser said.
"We haven't tired, the blood of our brothers have not отмщена," quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician, Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said they do not want to watch the referendum, which would have made him null and void.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
Well organized by the Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, have called for "the opposite" demonstration, but of precautions, not in Tahrir Square, and after mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before каирским University.
It was attended by a large number of women under покрывалами Salafi and supporters, who shouted: "The people requires the application of God's law."
They demanded that morsi: "очисти country!" and assured: "the Koran is our Constitution."
The struggle for power over symbolic square, where it all started, practically provoked the state of civil war.
Supporters of morsi, quite obviously, did not want to go to this risk.
"The Muslim Brotherhood," said that both opponents and supporters of the draft Constitution were loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people decide the election ballot boxes, in what direction should go to the country.
Most Islamists for the project, it is considered to be resolved matter.
"The concept of" human rights "is not mentioned never"
Hafiz Abu sayeda in fury from this forced the constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
, The human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian organization for human rights (еопр) defended the "Muslim Brotherhood," when under Mubarak they sat in jail or should be brought before the court.
Not because he shared their vision, but because human rights for him indivisible.
For this he was beaten, condemned, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never meet in a new Constitution, he regrets in conversation with "Welt am Sonntag."
The influence of morsi in all three branches of government in the state has been disappointing lawyer.
These measures are a clear attacks on democratic rules of the game and will of Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of having to strengthen civil state, the de facto president repudiated his," regrets sayeda.
Because without civil society organizations democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that all left it, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
For this payment can occur.
демонстрант in Tahrir Square, warned: "You are creating a monster that cannot control."

Norwegian ракфиск: the bad odourless fish in the world?
пятимиллионного населення Norway has one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe, but also all over the world.
Perhaps the secret of success in this country somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely зловонному fish блюду?
Take a few перезревших pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and потной sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You do отшибающий smell the scent of ракфиска - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called fagernes, in three hours drive from Oslo.
Around snow-covered picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but in the air разлит неистребимый characteristic smell.
ракфиск is trout, посыпанная salt бродившая in water up to a year, depending on what exactly duska need to achieve.
As thicken twilight and холодает crowd the Norwegians are collected at the festival in фагернесе dedicated to this himself, so to say, exciting блюду.
"Her eating a raw and запивают a small glass аквавита, local тминной vodka," explains хавард хальварсен, a local fireman and part-time as a "ракфисковый general by profession, who runs the festival."
Everywhere around us people eat нарезанную small cubes and запивают its massive amounts of fish.
"Someone like akvavit than ракфиск," says хавард.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I try to a couple of pieces.
If we manage to carry a piece of the nose, that things are not so bad - differs little from pieces of sushi, which you long were taken to a bus.
ракфиск poverty is the product of the different times, times, when, even before the emergence of refrigerators, fish in the autumn замачивали герметически closed barrels with salt water.
Then deep in winter, when the fish is good and thoroughly забродила, her извлекали and приглушив сприйняття alcohol use in food.
Even the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of the Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, which involve ñþäà jobs, higher wages and a strong social welfare system.
The citizens of Sweden (a longtime rival, and yet not so long ago and far more wealthy neighbor) massively come here to work.
ракфиск is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, but several зловонный element of past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here are expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you in 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and most of the inhabitants of the country is, it seems, suits.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name, Anders Breivik, расиста and right-wing экстремиста, last year расстрелявшего and убившего 77 men, women and children.
Not mentioning his name, terrorist attack called "what happened on July 22."
норвежцам is very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killing.
Today's well-being of Norway is based on growth (since the beginning of the seventies) One of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress разносящая trays with выдержанным ракфиском, a woman with long blond hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic welfare.
We the people - as you call it is reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We do not love displayed on display, we do not хвастливы.
Norway very carefully drawn from its oil income - most of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund, created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the financial crisis, when all сорили money, which they didn't have, Norway is economical подсчитывала all costs.
"As long as you can ski in winter and to go hiking in the summer, this is enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there are ракфиск," she adds with carefree laugh.
I am standing in the snow in the queue for a meal - ракфиска with me enough.
Here's a burger with лосиным meat is certainly exotica, a delicious creamy meat.
But in the evening there is more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel are a special dinner, dedicated to ракфиск, during which visitors ballot determine the best, or perhaps the ароматную fish.
There is a direct телеэфир, in which show leading to bow tie, surrounded by plates with ракфиском.
It is like the song contest "contest."
"So, тор-юрген assessment, what you have set for the best fish there have themselves in the mountains?"
"Yes, хавард, here is our assessment."
All laugh and applaud.
Someone falls from the Chair, perhaps перебрав аквавита.
Or maybe just надышавшись smell the fish.

Mexico's President Enrique peña nieto faces a tough start careers.
As long as the newly elected Mexican President Enrique peña nieto is preparing to join the post, BBC correspondent will grant invites us to look at the difficulties, he will have to face, and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The traffic in Mexico City now in particularly poor condition.
This city is overloaded transport and in the best of times, and on Monday were erected steel barricade, перерезавшие several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
But it did not, in order not to let people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent protests participants get to the Houses of Parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico's Enrique peña nieto наденет presidential sash and take the reins of the country.
Before him is not an easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance during the Felipe Calderon administration, which now stacks its powers, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years has already claimed some 60,000 lives.
"My government says the people of Mexico on its willingness to deal with violence," said earlier this week, Mr peña nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Mr. peña nieto has developed to such statements next to the President of the United States a political career as Governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, the country ' s populous and vast state, the capital of the country, opinions about the new leader was split.
прямолинейный Man
In the idyllic town валье-де-браво, for example, about it fondly remembered.
Residents put him in taking the revival of tourism, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highway, prezentācijas г-ом peña nieto, which differs from the roads with выбоинами and holes that were previously in this place.
Tablets with his name hang on a modern building sports centre and the exciting interactive museum devoted to climate change.
"We have come to associate with him hope for real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel ольвера Hernandez, Congressman from state headed by peña nieto институционно-революционной Party (PRI).
We expect real and dramatic change, which is so badly needed our country, primarily in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI party was overtaken by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman ольвера admits that after his 12-year-old absence in the presidential palace лос-пинос party has high hopes for Enrique peña nieto.
In addition, he refuted charges in бессодержательности, who put forward the new President of the opposition.
He is very прямолинеен and very devoted to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
This is a great statesman, and, above all, a man who can listen.
But in other parts of the state of many people will have a different view of the former губернаторе.
The municipality of несауалькойотль, also known under the name сьюдад-неса, is the most striking contrast with paved streets валье-де-браво.
Hidden under эстакадами highways, he in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality also have severe character of this city.
Earlier this year to restrain gangs were selling drugs in these areas, brought the troops; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
To somehow managed to survive only in the past two years, was discovered near a landfill dozens of bodies of dead women.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during губернаторства Mr peña nieto is significantly higher than the figure in the infamous прославившемся violence сьюдад-хуарес city, which has become a household name, when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. peña nieto, about it in the best case, you can say that during his tenure as Governor, he was not able to cope with the problem of murders of women.
In the worst case, however, his administration has been accused of complete disregard for the problem.
A resident of concrete houses, like most of the houses in this обветшалом районі иринея буэндия barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of his late daughter марианы moon.
According to the official version of the Mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she killed her сожитель.
"When I got to her house, was like that before this washed her body," Ms. буэндия recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body has already окоченело.
Mother марианы tells this story, and a portrait of daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, on which written only one word: justice.
It is in this, they said, was denied this family.
"State officials appealed to me as with the old сплетницей, discontented нарушительницей peace of mind.
They want people to simply take the faith of all, what they say, and помалкивали.
But it is wrong, so you can't, especially when around so many violations and transatlantic," she says.
By putting on a presidential sash on Saturday, President of peña nieto together with it will take a hard responsibility.
For the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected crimes associated with violence, and the new President promised to make a solution to this problem a priority during his presidency.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same President, what was the governor," says ольвера, Congressman from валье-де-браво PRI.
But it is this fear most victims' families in сьюдад-неса.

Bradley Manning not complaining about the mistreatment, the prosecution claims.
Prosecutors are trying to refute statements Bradley мэннинга about poor conditions of detention.
In the course of the hearing much attention was paid to stay мэннинга in military prison in квантико, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the terms of мэннинга were brutal.
The US army private accused in the abduction of thousands of secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that the average Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leaks of classified material in U.S. history, not took advantage of opportunities to submit a complaint against abuse, which, according to him, he had a chance to move, while in military custody.
During cross-examination on pre-trial (settlement) hearing in форт-миде, Maryland, military prosecutor major эшден Fein said that record weekly visits мэннинга administration officials in prison for nine months of his detention in квантико, Virginia, do not contain complaints about mistreatment.
Cross-examination in the asylum protection to stop справи мэннинга on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were violent and in themselves were sufficient punishment, was held in custody the day after manning said, he had intended to commit suicide.
Military intelligence analysis specialist, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused in the abduction of thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet site WikiLeaks.
Resource WikiLeaks confirmed that the source of information was not exactly manning.
During the hearing on Friday, the prosecutor Fein together with мэннингом looked at reports, which were filled after visits мэннинга квантико administration officials during his stay in prison, where he was on a strict regime of from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits prison officials questioned мэннингу and recorded his answers.
When the prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about reports, manning acknowledged that evaluates appeal to themselves in the prison administration as "excellent" and terms of as "very professionally organized."
Discussed reports contain no complaints about mistreatment, despite the fact that мэннинга directly asked about the conditions of detention, Fein said.
Manning replied that he expressed his oral concern about these issues and that посещавшие his administration officials discussed with him these problems and have stated that they will, but not documented this in writing.
"They recorded" no problems "(after discussing my complaints), but it does not mean that I have not touched on this subject in conversation," says manning.
A military judge, Colonel Denise lind, also asked мэннинга, why does he not complaining about ill-treatment with him in January 2011 during a meeting of the Commission, рассматривавшей суицидальные intentions, which he expressed in writing for several months before.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to achieve, he was acquitted of the regime to "Prevention of injury" and softened conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited detention regime - a level lower than the supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as security for the sake of others.
"I wanted to know the administration, that everything is all right with me, so they changed the Prevention of injury... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view," manning said.
On Thursday, manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and translation in Kuwait, where he was detained nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at the naval base in квантико, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he has thought about suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness because of strong heat.
He explained that psychologically very hard, when you don't give to know, how do you solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world сжался to base кэмп-арифжан, to the size of my prison," manning said on Thursday.
"I thought that I die in the cage."
While in квантико, manning, according to him, spent most of the time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in complete solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blankets, slippers, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says that he tried to move, so as to sleep or even just lie in the daytime defy the rules.
According to мэннинга during sleep in the eye him constantly beat the light coming from the outside camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he переворачивался in bed at night, that, according to him, his будили and forced to turn over on his back.
Lawyer мэннинга lodged an official objection about unlawful treatment of мэннингом in January 2011.
In April 2011 мэннинга was transferred to a military prison in форт-ливенворт, Kansas State.
In addition, on Friday, the judge расспросила мэннинга about the statement, which he made during testify on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in квантико, have forced him to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners at a morning inspection.
Manning said he had not been able to hide behind a blanket during inspections.
Answering the questions of the judges on Friday, manning said that he understood from the order guard that must throw blanket, which could прикрываться, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to leave him.
On Thursday, manning said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempts to show the officer that he poses no danger to themselves.
Manning said, the officer said, that could use the gum trousers or slippers to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to мэннинга, his underwear, slippers and sunglasses were taken from cameras.
His lawyers hope the judge, at least, take into account that he had to endure during their detention, and significantly reduce prison sentence, if manning will be found guilty of a military court, which should begin to review his case in the beginning of the next year.
Protection said it plans to offer мэннингу admit blame for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
A hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the prosecution is expected to insist that conditions of detention were acquitted.
The Pentagon argues that manning was held in квантико in accordance with the rules regulating the content of those arrested with the strict regime.
Among the charges brought мэннингу are aiding the enemy, illegal assistance to the publication of data on the Internet, the transfer information relating to the national defense, and the kidnapping of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of conviction, he could face life imprisonment.

My crisis of national self-determination - the story of American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to use themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they resemble the residents of a country of difficult times.
Ruben наваретте believes that Mexican American origin torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico I passed through the corridor for arriving, approached the border control and remained in place.
Signs point to two lines: one for mexicanos (Mexican), the second for extranjeros (foreigners).
I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life called мексиканцем.
It's just a name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves ирландцами, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.
Later I stopped on a complex structures "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need to conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary are poorer than the speakers, and I cannot get rid of American accent.
So I pulled out his American passport and was in turn for extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique peña nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were familiar to meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
The President of peña nieto willingly spoke about the rise of Mexican economic, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of having to move to the United States.
He wants to sign the agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President of peña nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals have sounded.
For Mexico's relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grievances question.
Most Americans do not think about that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and at the barrel rifles forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.
But Mexicans have for centuries, rather than minutes, and see reminders of those events in all.
So is only a statesman us обмолвиться though word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society immediately hear complaints about what Americans посягают on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants of montezumae преисполняются militancy.
The most complex are Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about insults?
Their enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people who are in this country for a possible, and those for whom no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point, their family history êòî-ëèáî - father or grandfather - had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most often it was certain kinds of Mexicans - смуглые, no education, from poor peasant families.
We their descendants, and we remember about it.
In Mexico, see it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we went to good schools and made ourselves comfortable on the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination запутано and it is unclear, but we know what kind of state as its.
The United States of America.
In addition, we know that the majority of Mexican elite and the ruling class we do not like.
We respond to them the same.
They see us as a reminder about humiliating defeats that happened and refer to us as a second-class, how to ненастоящим Mexicans.
We are not good enough say in Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico not strong enough.
Our very existence for them due to failures.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't have been now for silk curtain, found in the United States сытую life, but having lost spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and легально moved to the United States even in childhood, and it reminds me of that between справжніми Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, there are certain friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin, it is a shame.
She believes that belongs to both these countries and a citizen of the United States.
At the same time, many of my friends of Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to any one of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los tigres del north, but love and Bruce спрингстина.
Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose the roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
And in the United States we call Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship without that not enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Mexican Americans worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States.
We could tell their друзьям-американцам about which it is a beautiful country and how cool it is to attend, and might be persuaded to political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
Nothing will happen.
Too much offense in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, raging corruption and the drug trade, many of us does not believe this country so great.
Sorry, but разбирайтесь with this themselves, амигос.
And this is true.
If part of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States that, as they have done with Mexico century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still in grievances over how recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.

The old battle on the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas group can become fragile foundation for further Peace
Possibility of lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
Sound, which have become the usual meaningless debate about who first started; many buildings turned into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his извечном conflict in the Middle East came changes.
To this can be treated differently, but events of the "Arab Spring" закружили in rebellious storm many well-established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis could not stay away from the vortex потрясшего region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than previously.
However, there are reasons, giving hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
A war without winners
At first glance, this situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement which was signed on 21 November, will be performed, the clashes this week only lent by the officers on both sides.
Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which took power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, заявят from that they forced Israel to back down, despite the incurred loss.
In spite of the fact that some of the leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Hamas actually increases its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the now more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new powerful and rich friends.
возрождающийся regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, performed with support for Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing countries of the Persian Gulf.
торжествующие Hamas claim about creating around Israel's Islamic Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, in which rules the paramilitary group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all the more происламистские insurgents power is about to overthrow Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king is threatened by Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region has been on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad over morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was the secular dictator, not уделявшим особено support Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, in contrast, are, in many ways similar to Hamas organization, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic расстановках Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice cannot drown out even to Israel and America.
At the same time, the supporters of the "tough" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In military terms Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli missile system "Iron dome" has demonstrated its creation and successfully destroyed many of the running costs of Hamas rockets.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained true to their unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for the beginning of the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity in Israel, especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
In spite of the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis killed by rockets, produced from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the Wall, which comes to the territory of the West Bank - a large part of unacknowledged Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegitimacy of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for looming on 22 January elections - joined forces with even more violent conservatives under the leadership of авигдора Lieberman, very comfortable.
What is the reason to pander to the Palestinians and give them their own country?
If to give in their hands all power in the West Bank, whether they will run out of missiles toward Israel, as do their brethren in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise the head.
Perhaps, supporters of the "hard line" victorious; however, their estimates can be disproved the Arab Spring.
With the Islamists, who came to power in Egypt and other countries, are not very warm feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Defense of Israel's budget more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
Outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments to strengthen its own economy.
Pragmatism, Egyptian President morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on ceasefire, is a good sign and could spell the beginning of change.
Israel, in not less, should take into account the long-term effects of their policies.
As the democratic change in Arab countries, the Palestinian right to self-determination is a bomb ticking, which sooner or later explode in the Israeli occupied territories, like автобусу взорванному in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression has undermined the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbate these problems.
For violent operations, which are held every few years on the territory of Gaza to crush Hamas movement, have to pay a growing discontent with the international community.
Both sides need in the external pulse
It remains the only solution to which constantly call for sensible representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education two states and territories concessions to Israel in exchange for security.
Hope, not too impressive in the short term," hope that the cease-fire will enable other countries more effectively influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which has a long time to decide to cut off supplies of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position, in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967 with the exchange of territories and sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming vote in the UN, the result of which can become a virtual Palestinian statehood recognition.
Their role is to engage Israel to the negotiating table, and President Obama should play.
During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he continued to show an unwillingness to connect to solving this problem.
This drastically недальновидная position.
The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

In Australia, the law came into force on unified packaging for cigarettes.
Warning about the dangers of smoking and image hit by diseases body parts in contrast are allocated to damp green boxes, are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice Australian law однотипной packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and colour of different brands of the same box уныло-оливкового color with a nasty snapshot affected disease body parts and images of children, whose health has been decimated their parents' smoking.
In addition to the different images and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the atrocious, introduced in mandatory with this Saturday - the names of brands, which printed the same fine print.
This is the most severe conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia declares that the purpose of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of a lifetime fashion status.
The basis for this decision was based on the results of the research, показавших that people, not started smoking to 26 years in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
"It is clear that even in the very young children understand the meaning, who are trying to bring tobacco company with the help of packaging," explains Health Minister tanya плиберсек, citing research, that, for example, the Crown in Ken logo is associated with the idea of the Princess in children.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of smokers in the world, so that these changes are not particularly affect on profit multinational corporations, but the possibility of such measures are already considering and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed to the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this would only increase the black market, which will be sold on the cheap and affordable cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his pioneer," said Scott mcintyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to business.
Sandra ḫāʾ from a small family company zico import pty Ltd argues that demand for портсигары and silicone coffin covers, hides unpleasant pictures on the packaging, grown rapidly (первоклашку) Since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British imperial tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to appeal against the law.
According to Sandra ḫāʾ, company zico already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects a new party.
For us it is good business.
Potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among a part of the population, to which used these measures.
After making a series of television advertising laws, which make illegal cigarettes in Australia and support their sports events, as well as prohibiting salemans to cigarettes in a visible place, advertising of tobacco products moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government banned local companies and websites to advertise on the network, but it cannot limit in this foreign sites.
"If you sell tobacco and you have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their products on the Internet sounds very attractive," explains becki freeman исследующая public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Freeman says growth in the number of reviews on торгові марки, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in social networking sites, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether this is the work of private citizen, who loves marlboro cigarettes, so much so that did not spare time and energy and made the video, or is behind this campaign?
Australian department of the British American Tobacco company argues that the industry is now busy adapting to the new rules, more than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States are laying claim to the World Trade Organization, declaring that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries trade relations with Australia are poor.
The WTO is expected by the end of 2013.
According to tanya плиберсек, government обсуждало with other countries to make their similar laws on the packaging.
In 2001, Canada first introduced compulsory placement of photographs, warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now it is a rule made in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of a tightening of laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia has not obey innovations.
These pictures of me not scratching.
I just don't pay attention.
"Simply выхватываешь прячешь and a cigarette Pack in his pocket," explains Victor El Haig покупающий tumor cigarettes with a photograph of the mouth to pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me quit - this is my baby daughter.
James йу, head of tobacco shop king of the pack in the centre of Sydney, argues that the same upakovka compounded the task in goods at levels
"I have used the unloading of a new party had gone an hour, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and not to ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, okay, it's over, are closing shop," he says, вскидывая hands up.

Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connection - it's not so bad.
In this thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, and because of our aircraft revealed the mechanical problems and it was replaced by another plane, which we have to.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight - It's really boring, and there is not much help books, magazines, nor the iPhone, nor even duty-free shops.
But recently, more and more scientists and experts in child development argue in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss not so bad.
It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity.
Because in the modern world, we are always in some of your screen, the benefits of boredom are past us.
Maybe we need to strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time, there is no.
We will come back to it.
Before I, like many others, believed that boredom - the invention of the relatively recent times when people have more free time.
This is not the case, argues Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history Canadian University of Calgary, the author of the book "a fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a enjoying history, Yale University press, 2011).
"In fact boredom boasts a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in помпеях found Latin inscription of boredom, reports dating to the first century.
At the same time it remains an open question as to how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York In Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often transform.
Having studied materials research on this topic and asking the question target group in 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people want, but cannot do that," that would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and апатией, he says, is that скучающий man is not doing something that would like to do.
When apathy do anything I don't want to.
The main in experienced boredom, he says, it is a "violation of attention and associated with this deterioration in sentiment and feeling that time is slowly."
The description of the boredom can seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood said that despite the possible connection between these .מצבים скучающие people see the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people undergoing depression, see the problems in itself.
Sometimes it seems to us that we bored, when in fact we just difficult to focus on something.
In his study "the unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the Journal perspectives on psychological science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, which participants listened to the recording of the voice, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard loud noises not related to business programs included in the next room, others have heard these same sounds at a low volume, so that they could hardly hear, and a third group listened to only record voice without any sound track.
Those participants who heard a low volume, noted that they were bored, most - it was hard to concentrate them, but they did not know the reasons for this and it is attributed to boredom.
When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, says mark J. фенске, Associate Professor of neurology at the University of гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something неинтересное," for example, всматриваясь in the flow of goods on line in search of marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed, he continues, that when people start покачиваться on a chair or to draw a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions not just help to relax physically.
"The study found that children who do not prohibit fidget and go round, learn and remember more information, better than children, from which require sit tight," says Professor фенске.
In some moments we all feel bored: delay in flight (as in my case), listening to dull speech, looking through неинтересный film.
However, different people have different levels of propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s to measure such individual features researchers have developed a special "scale propensity to boredom."
To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and approval, for example," much of what I have to do, однообразно and monotonously "or" me too much interesting, so on that does not have time. "
With the help of these questionnaires, the researchers determined that the boys are bored more girls," says Stephen воданович, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida," particularly if there is a variety of external stimuli.
But on the whole teenagers often are bored at all.
In 1991. Reed larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted a pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents or eight times a day.
He received the following results: 32 percent of teens said they bored in school and during homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school.
The only 3% of parents have noted that it is boring.
Professor larson said that he had no information about what would such data about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "in adolescence have to peak propensity to boredom," mainly because children and teenagers do not allow the full address, than they do.
Let's get back to my original question: boredom is useful?
Sometimes there is no, because the most extreme, she, as research shows, can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor воданович посвятивший study this problem more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something different; it is boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But this is the brain does not always knows what to do better.
If you will be bored and you direct this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.
However, if you only get to watch TV, you will be better for some time, and it will take place soon.
So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, it ceases to be bored, but he could learn to deal with boredom independently or in any way any other way to manage their time and employment," said Professor фенске.
"And skills such independent regulation used in various situations," he says.
Your child is studying not only occupy themselves something, he also learns самоконтролю at all.
I don't think that bored need to somehow praise.
But regard it as something bad is not worth it.
Rather, it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action, and technology.
Professor Eastwood agree with this.
"So, we see that we need more often feel bored, with the boredom is extremely unpleasant, неутолимое desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from the constant worries and just relax.
"In today's world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when there is a silence, we теряемся and do not know what to do."

While it is unclear how the new law is applied on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony orozko девятнадцатилетний player football team and a student of public college in the southeast of Colorado accused of committing criminal offences, which has been in that will soon be completely legally throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it.
Mr. orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in ламаре and was driving in the car on the prairies near the border with канзасом, when they had been stopped.
After police found marijuana in the machine, Mr. orozko came agenda in court for possession of drugs and possession of the device for drug - minor offences, for each of which причитается a fine of $100 - and set the trial date.
"With us are treated as criminals," says Mr orozco.
But does it criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been underway for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the hundreds of small court cases depends not so much from the law, but from the point of consideration.
Accusations of minor offences related to marijuana, already filmed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has adopted a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped to nominate charges 21 years of age and older people for possession of small amounts that will be seen as legitimate, as only a couple of weeks of the law will come into force.
But in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider the existing matters related to marijuana, and continue to attract the responsibility for possession of the drug.
At the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to mountain areas of the West vote for it, in order to prevent the emergence of new in their places, licensed state shops to sell marijuana.
"All of this is growing so rapidly, that I don't even know what to expect next," said Daniel J. oates, the chief of police in the town of aurora in the East from Denver.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also озадачено почесывают head.
They will form a licensing rules to determine the order of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this needs to be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other States in settling the problems using marijuana for medical purposes, and now first for entertainment.
"In Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian and Smith, representative of the Council on regulation of alcohol production and sales in Washington State.
But now, no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than to put forward any proposals and hope that it will.
"We have no real precedent, to which we could focus," he says.
The legislation of the state of Washington, named i-502 enters into force on December 6 and a whole year plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the government licensing system is not yet, and the right of ownership marijuana already узаконено.
But there is a more complicated technical aspects that need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find the balance between state regulation of "normal access" to licensed marijuana with bans on trade it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"Especially hard to place the licensed companies to trade marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben livingston, representative of the recently established research group "center of the legalization of marijuana."
On November 21, a police chief oates of aurora city sent to subordinates e-mail message saying that prosecutors will no longer attract persons, under age 21, responsible for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops уличать people in these violations "starting from this moment."
A police chief oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals, in the city выращивающих marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal drug traffickers and distributors.
The weld county prosecutor in northern Colorado, Ken buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the use of its people undergo a course of treatment.
At the moment 119 Persons charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.
"The duty of our institutions - to pursue criminal for actions that are considered to be at the moment they are committed," Mr. buck said in a statement.
The response was controversial even in places like rural district of Mesa, where participants голосування rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police grand junction, the largest city in the district, no longer has the responsibility of adults for possession of small amounts of drugs.
The district attorney pete хаутцингер supported this decision, but also decided not to take charges on already open cases related to storage of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law, as long as it does not change is our primary responsibility," he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of the residents of Colorado, which took part in the vote, supported this decision, the inclusion of issues of marijuana for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy.
And the confused reaction residents in different places of обнажила ambiguity State relations between the local authorities to experiment with marijuana.
"The county prosecutors in this respect there is a cultural barrier," explains Sean macalister, денверский lawyer, representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization to reform marijuana laws.
"They harassed people for so long that now cannot really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states, in which a small number of marijuana are as to alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field across the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory легализованной trade, but at the same time they cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Supporters of legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice Department to give in on this issue.
Despite several received wide publicity arrests of traffickers and patients, употреблявших marijuana for medical indications, the Federal Government in most cases gave good trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau of narcotics are unlikely to be врываться in house to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they will hardly be turning a blind eye to regulated by the state of recreational marijuana shops, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. сабет, a former adviser to combat drug trafficking in the Obama administration.
Some city in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores at the sale of marijuana, and so could not open up earlier than a year later.
Last week, montrose, a town in the western part of the state, has proposed to the six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which, apparently, will be approved in the next week.
"We don't want to be in this position, that we выдадим someone a license, and then it would cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a Member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendments.
And now we see a contradiction between the local voting and the results, voted for that state.
There are still many unresolved questions.

петронелла уайэтт: I survived from Oxford for what I am a conservative.
Persecution of university students for their views started not today.
How much I remember myself, I always dreamed to go to Oxford University.
My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world educational institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, закладывающий two foundations of civilization - freedom and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studies on the Faculty вустерского college at Oxford University in the late eighties, I packed up and left, resulting in the first real scandal in my life.
My father did not survive and burst into tears.
Friends have been disoriented.
The evening standard newspaper claimed that I threw the College, because I didn't like it, that my однокурсники sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left, because I had to drink from щербатых Cups.
In fact it was not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, I ran, because systematically hounded and intimidated.
It is not because of my rather unusual name or what I studied in a private school.
I hounded for only one reason, and in this the cradle просвещенности it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow уайэтт was known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of conservatives.
You ask, why to remember about this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, придерживающееся center-right views, is subject to the same harassed.
This институционализированная and constantly growing hatred студентам-консерваторам in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as the one who is disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The Conservatives from college student club êîðïóñ Christie in Cambridge say their "often actively isolate way, subjected to personal attacks and make us feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter in the committee on equal rights college additional representative to ensure freedom of expression of opinion.
Their situation only compounded released recently on BBC two documentary about politics in a student environment "country wonders: young, smart and right," in which the Conservatives have presented eccentric and neo-Nazi.
The film was shown Joe cooke, a former President of the Association of Oxford University conservatives, who travelled to роллс-ройсе wears a silver suit and stick with silver набалдашником.
In other universities студенты-консерваторы complain that of them do "scapegoats due to rising fees for their studies."
Luke 20 years, Vice President of the Association of black Conservatives ноттингемского university, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said that "in a university environment increases bias towards the left.
People who we do not even know in advance we believe nerve and disruptive children of rich parents with impunity."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history faculty college corpus Christie, such an atmosphere in which was filed a claim on strengthening its security, calls "неуютной," and stephanie черилл, 19 years old, the new President of the Association of conservative at Oxford University, says that the ratio of student club to носителям center-right views dramatically worsened.
"This is a threat to both for atmosphere of intellectual debate, and just for a normal life members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was one.
I was there in September 1986, a sheepish and shy восемнадцатилетней girl.
OXFORD лихорадило from hatred for the Conservative Party.
The year before, University of voting deprived former студентку Margaret Thatcher her an honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even сталинистам.
In the first days of the week первокурсника, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I first heard that I waited ahead.
I still didn't know that teachers not only looked at glide intend direct persecution against студентов-консерваторов themselves, but also gladly took part in it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, the privatization of government and opposition to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated through обшитые wooden panels wall audiences.
On my first seminar I needed to translate eighteenth-century French text in English, and I was not ready for the fact that followed it.
"Miss уайэтт," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "Please, put it the first paragraph."
The text was for me, I hardly запиналась.
Harry Pitt was very желчным man with the face, like a cake.
"тэтчеристы damentally not teach French brain or they simply do not have enough?" he asked.
Other students захихикали.
I had tears in my eyes were.
"I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in their free time, if you don't, of course, very busy, rotating in society," пробрюзжал Pitt.
I returned to my room quite miserable.
In the evening in College I was sitting at dinner one; then someone clapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, second-year student in the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of conservative University.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
"Unfortunately, things are as follows:
Over every, who are suspected of supporting the Conservatives, will get me down.
For me it is not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
They most первокурсников-консерваторов pretend to labour."
Later, in the local pub, I cowardly tried to face it.
I insisted that I not with all that says Margaret Thatcher.
The trick didn't work.
The freshman at the Faculty of philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You daughter fascist pigs.
You are catching."
Other students picked up his words.
I was a flawed, dirty.
"As the Conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
"They колотят each other, right?"
I felt like, should be felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Will I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under cover of night?
If I am forced to become лейбористкой and hide their real beliefs?
The coming three years I have become seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, not hidden his conservative views, was Norman stone, a professor of modern history.
He hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on issues of foreign policy and one of her спичрайтеров.
In college, he almost did not appear.
He despised him for provinciality мелочность and commitment to марксистско-детерминистскому view on history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of билкент in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you won't be happy," he told me.
I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among непредвзятых capital's friends and relatives.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies from 1940 to 1948 years there were any political views.
"But it is also the best University in the world," he said жалобно.
- There is not capable, not only in the city of dormant spires.
Even my друзья-коммунисты always behaved perfectly."
His wet eyes помутнели.
"Not regularly any hasty decisions.
I am confident that this is just a joke.
You разобьешь my heart, if you university."
I was изнурена regular trips to London and my emotional protection weaker.
My friend, also a conservative, did not survive the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.
Next week during the seminar, when another teacher history quite seriously called me "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the soul сгорая from shame, I admitted that "I clean brains parents" and called them "the old fools."
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was going to kill my father.
At the time he wrote every week for two columns for publications ïðèíàäëåæàùèõ руперту мердоку.
My door was locked.
I did take, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me плаксой and cloth.
But in eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment.
The печальнее that it was Oxford, which not only released 14 Tory prime ministers, but to this day is behind the незаслуженной reputation of the university, in which value equality and freedom.

The most difficult profession in the world: miners with кавах-иджена
The four euro Indonesian miners risk their lives and health, втаскивая 70 kilograms of sulfur on top of a volcano on steep каменистым trails
There are people, for which their work - hell, and others are literally in hell.
Among them are anto widjaja, one of 400 miners who make a living mining of sulphur in the top of a volcano кавах-иджен, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day anto comes down on the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of earth solidifies when in contact with air.
отколов huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket on their shoulders and carries up to a precipitous rocky road.
Up to the top of the volcano, whose height is 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but изможденным грузчикам requires more than 40 minutes to climb черепашьим step, with difficulty keeping balance and carefully нащупывая road, not to оступиться and not fall from cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them life, as happened with one туристкой from France, which started several years ago with rocks кавах-иджена.
Miners with кавах-иджена earn 5 евроцентов for every kilogram of sulfur, which are mined
Once at the top, they pave a road between туристами, who photographed them, as if they were apes from circus and wearily carrying heavy baskets, are three kilometers to scale that mining company расположила slightly higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
It is about PT Kandy нгримби, enterprise, which has been running since 1960 the volcano, and it is best not to say, of its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 евроцентов) for every kilogram of sulphur.
Then it it sells over 10,000 rupees (83 евроцентов) petrochemical industrial plants, because this mineral circulated in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
"As the norm is переноска 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each ходку," explains us anto, which usually performs three daily carry.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems мизером for such нечеловеческого efforts, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"поденная платня шахтерам very high by local standards, where coffee for collecting pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," explains грузчик, who previously worked as a bricklayer in tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was just rupees (6.2 euros) per day and plot was not such a hard, but anto returned with his family to Indonesia in баньюванги town not far from the volcano on a valid reason, which is the same as massive, sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java, she took to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's breathing with difficulty, continual cough, and he has constantly слезятся eyes due to toxic gases
In my 27 years anto spent three years, risking a кавах-иджене sulfur which is already beginning to take a toll on it despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he's breathing with difficulty, continual cough, and he has constantly слезятся eyes due to toxic gases, which produces volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.
"поработаю two more years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French," he promises to more than an acceptable English.
Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be tourist guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of mule.
Dividing dirty wooden hut with other носильщиками, he gets up every day in two hours of night, because the sulfur does not cease to flow out at night, when its distinctive yellow turns into a blue and glittering among the gloom.
Challenging the shadow, anto down in a crater, covering a road, a small Lantern подсоединенным to his каске, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters being dragged basket with Gray on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company not механизировала sulphur production for cost savings and does not provide any equipment носильщикам, who work at its own expense and with such deprivation.
In fact, they are not even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for the picture collection, which, along with incoming ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards this reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its людей-мулов.
"This work for cattle, and not for the people," said бадрусин, a stocky носильщик 42 years, who spent on кавах-иджене three decades since he left college.
Able to raise up to 110 pounds, he assures that will endure the work "as much as can," because he needs money for the education of their three children aged from 18 to 10 years.
Don't retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although the sulfur is burning throat and жжет eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense pillars of smoke emerging from the volcano, they are so Hardy, that no one complains about its severe disease... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, артрозы, pain in his knees and ulcers on his shoulders, which деформировались under the weight of baskets.
Balance the basket on his back, унайник now only can raise 50 kilogram in his 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades are 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three truck carrying on a warehouse in тамансари, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers on a narrow path among зарослей.
"Don't retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says унайник, widely opening your mouth, in which several teeth missing.
One of his five children, senior, 30 years, also runs a viral host sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation of one of the most difficult sessions in the world: What do human mules with кавах-иджена.

Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accuse career, stress and housing prices and in the absence of children's education.
"The population of Singapore need to grow."
My husband patriot, you are my wife патриотка will fulfill our duty and will create a life!
It might seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising мятных lozenges, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying something like "Let's break bao (bulku) in the stove," to laugh over birth rates in Singapore.
Advertising agency, which has made this video, bbh лелеет hope that using advertising they can draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that people wanted to use the power of music to have fulfilled "its national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce a similar, so we feel that this is the issue that we must address.
We knew that the government tried to do much, for example to launch perfume with pheromones or to arrange quick dating (блиц-свиданий).
Many of these ideas may have been innovative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make the most creative thing as possible, in order to solve this problem, namely compose rap?
1.2 child
Who don't take it so lightly – is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policy for the citizens' enthusiasm for the birth of a greater number of children.
The package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, prolongs aizraujošu maternity and provide tax relief.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech государство-город in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of his leadership and its strict public control.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to his national management on the population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang Wei Min, Director of Policy on to couples and families of the national office for population, says that the reason "better education" and "more than a wide range of career opportunities."
"This allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social norms boosted the number of singles and postponement of marriages and births, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at boosting the immigration to oppose the reduction of the population, causing resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where flourishes barely скрываемая xenophobia in relation to many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which has been criticized for maintaining wages at a low level, and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that last year, Singapore's ruling party received the worst result in elections since independence.
After the elections was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has known impact on economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenses and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to not built up so much ìàëåíüêîãî housing.
For example, it is the impact on the real estate sector.
A guide to urban development has shifted to control number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that you can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments площею 46 square meters sold very well.
However, it is believed that they can contribute to холостому lifestyle and deprived of their incentive housing developers who want to build a large family.
But Lim yū домостроительной sun, General Director of the developers, said that their "обувные boxes" sold much faster than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that these apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues increase.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers, who previously put tape, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too перенапряженные
Singapore, a city-state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing national fertility, after talking with сингапурцами, who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems, that they will not have much effect.
"People are very перенапряжены, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people this delay," says the young administrator.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.
Men and women mention his career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them to have children.
So, no matter how the government has urged its citizens to the birth of children, in regard to childbirth, the final word remains for сингапурцами.

Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, it is about private property or the personal life," which have the right to protect from any interference."
That is a personal for a minor under 16 years?
As he uses this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
Does he risk, which is under discussion in Internet situations, which certainly would not shared outside of the Internet?
Elperiódico took an interview with five guys from 10 to 15 years, frequent users of the web.
In four cases, they were associated with the term "something very my" in personal plane, and "password and username," when used it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets I wouldn't loaded in the post," says a 10-year-old Jorge, when trying to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and windows live messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"This is a very sensitive secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he said.
The fb I load the beautiful images or pictures of the Games.
Also I play with their friends.
"I would not have shared his photography, which is not my, or someone who behaves is stupid," he says.
The boy is aware that bad publish obscene photographs of naked people, crime or write offensive or furious comments.
Jorge assures that knows 35 friends, who in his communication, and its nine фолловеров on Twitter.
Most of them have relatives.
The mother to date, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I got Twitter, to express themselves and to write interesting твиты.
"I don't know if I respond, I only their load," he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with their friends по-быстрому", "he says.
Without thinking, is that would never accepted a request from an unknown person.
Wouldn't be with someone who recommended that it would be the stranger.
The case of a 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, and in the latest acknowledges that doesn't know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
The boy said to him, nobody втирался in confidence and not asked his home address or phone number.
"If demand will put the squeeze on me or simply remove them from their account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to experience what today is known as cyberbullying.
One familiar my girlfriend шантажировали in social networks.
He threatened and extorted money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures us.
The victim, according to Jose, not removed the account.
"Only included confidentiality."
Then he explains the sequence of steps for the account settings safely.
In contrast to Jorge, this boy would download photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or конфузных situations.
Yes, I would have made it, if the person I don't like or if it wants to.
"Although I know that this cyberbullying," he confirms.
Key Issues
марьелос porras, преподавательница English and an expert on education and training, believes that, to keep children and teenagers, you need to understand that the goal of social networks - to inform.
"The Internet has appeared as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Porras points out that Member mark пренски, master of pedagogy of Yale University and the author of the Labour digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital natives that they, children and young people, who were born in the era of technology.
"We digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we still learn to themselves," she says.
He said that this topic is difficult," because we ask them to have a certain criteria of what can or cannot distribute, publish or speak, at the age of maturity, when there are not enough for this."
"Also to be selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what the privacy of children and adolescents," ask questions that make their thinking.
"To say that they do not do this, it is useless," she adds.
Then porras outlines some of the options: there are things that you would not have told the stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would have liked, if published a photo you like that you published about his friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you подписываешь photos from the parties, if you ask for permission from other people, to celebrate them?
And one more, the need to know, what are you doing in every moment?
Another option is to give them to understand that they should behave online, just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, should also be on social networks," she says.
Vigilance
эстуардо Guardia, university lecturer, professor of primary education and consultant on education policy, explains the need for the heads of families in good faith to read social networks.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reasons for talking to children about perceptions of opening the account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is permitted to distribute or publish", "he says.
According to the Guardia, the key question is to remind children lesson "don't tell with strangers."

"South America must learn from Europe in the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the "South America, in this case, yes, Europe should learn from."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), being held in Lima, Peru told state television that Europeans "were killing each other during the Second World War" and in other clashes, "but now they are almost one fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the project of the South American citizenship, which approve of Unasur Member.
"We need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is happening with members of the Andean Community, but still there is a reactionary sector, who want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has proved, in addition, a renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) Under the prerequisite to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed a pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, южноамериканцы, on the contrary, the sign everything.
"Inexplicably, that is the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said, referring to political asylum, the Ecuador Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision, because with him not betraying their principles, and maintained its "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time "there were some suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be observed the process."
He criticized, moreover, the Swedish Justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged sexual offences, while "the Swedish legislation believes that it is possible to do it through video conferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of physical and mental health of Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived in our embassy, but the Ambassador told me that he had a small, the lung problem, nothing serious," said ecuadorensis Head of State.
What really is, so this is the danger of his physical and mental health because of the confined in a small space without being able to do exercises on the air.
"This affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution of the problem of asylum, presented by Assange since June in эквадорском embassy in London, by providing guarantees of immunity, which would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that talks were in London on finding solutions to the problem confined founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not talking about human rights, is a word we do not use, but in this case were constant debates.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because the lawyer Assange, Baltasar garson, leads a number of processes in the various European entities," he said.
And expressed his opinion that "if Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as it allows its legislation and perfectly as she has already done in other cases, допросит Senor Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London or допросит him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to show itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and stressed that does not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression."
"The enemies of freedom of the press is not spoiled злодеи-политики, and bad journalists, supporting наживу, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained content that is neither of these journalists," bankers, nor the bourgeois страны-гегемоны not dominate in Ecuador," and added that, being reelected, deepen the revolution "to continue the development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain a veto of Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next election, defending is the fact that the "should be solid and not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of the rule of law," because in fact it has eroded the legitimacy of Paraguay "democracy."
The Ecuadorian President considers, in addition," absolutely justified "desire to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate now with Nicaragua on sea borders between the two countries after the decision by the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which turned out to be in favor of никарагуанского maritime sovereignty.
At the moment it is not enforced.
It is a problem between South American and Latin American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by desire to go along.
You need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed his hope for a good end to the dispute about sea borders, which are in the same court, Peru and Chile, and said that the "right to Latin America to apply to the International Court if the two countries are obliged to make a decision, no matter how hard it was."

Correa assured that if loses the elections in February 2013, the leaves from public life.
In personal terms, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations, such as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be fixed by the political power.
"My political movement considered it, that's what I guaranteed the probable victory, so have to acknowledge this responsibility," he said.
If elected, this would be my last term as President, and then we go out of public life.
If you lose, it is the same.
"This decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just talked to венесуэльским Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went for treatment, which was already planned, рутинное, and that he is expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.

Mortality from Aids today is the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"I like оглушили," he recalls the difficult, despite all the time with a doctor, moment.
The young man hide it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. And his efforts to materialize - he has already said his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio - one of the oldest patients "" вич-отделения hospital hospital civil de Guadalajara (hcg), where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives with the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) "for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe - then there was too little treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased treated patients.
Even so, Director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him," because he had a cut."
In other words, in those times have AIDS was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and do this without worsening the quality of life.
However, not knowing about his illness, many people still come, when the virus has already damaged the," истощил "their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases," a great achievement for the moment is that the patient's survival, which starts treatment in a timely manner, and survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the вич-отделения hcg, Jaime andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that the information has been confirmed by in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
инфекционист and expert on HIV/AIDS, andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the extent of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the best expected duration of life, those who are not drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 cd4, and up to 50 years, when reports about 500 cd4.
In short, this means that whoever gets the diagnosis вич-положительного at the age of 25 years, according to these terms," while maintaining control, can live up to 75 years without problems," he explained.
To assess this progress, we should remember that Mexicans today in the average life expectancy is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients died in the national database.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and is already registered 187 deaths by May this year; however, argues that there are ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why there is still летальные outcomes?
"Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I can imagine it themselves as things stand in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don't know about its инфицированном state, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He brought сокрушительные data: "nine out of ten patients come when already have some оппортунистическую infection; what you need to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and we need to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people that it will be asked."
In his motion agree experts and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in Jalisco (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned to check into the private lab побужденный only in that it made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even stradal саркомой kaposi cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some people think that will die, and did not want to know.
"If I die, I will be better still надираться three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I well питаюсь do exercise, take drugs.
Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have many lessons, I travel, have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, care about yourself and the other person," I have enumerated Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with milenio Jalisco to prompt his statement of those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, is fear.
Let проверятся, if there was the risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are infected, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know they can live as any other person, being responsible.
It is his report summarizes the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Big gap between programs in health and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which started a problem with HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places, devoted to this task," actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, we now offer packages to 100, and it is very good, but now it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to the new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you?" is a popular issue, with ехидством and condemnation, from the social workers, school staff consultants, pharmacies and health workers, who did not want to hear teenagers, assured advocate.
Propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for прилавками and to sotnia them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places, who often attends youth.
It is not promoting promiscuity.
It is not about the payment of beer and motel, said Governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked, is the distribution of condoms possible under his leadership.
"It's not sexy, it is best to make condoms available to those who already practicing sexual activity," he said.
Key Data in Jalisco
зареєстровано 13,435 summary cases (12,158 1,317 HIV and AIDS).
The State is the 4th place in the national rankings in new and total 13th on HIV and AIDS cases.
92% of the infections are related to sexual way, 6 percent through blood and 2% to перинатальному way.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as far as the one recorded case is from 4 to 5 people, who do not know about it.

Hector "hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life"
заядлый basketball traveler Hector "hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years connected with the sport and, thanks to him, traversed the entire world.
Few people in Puerto Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector "hetin" Reyes.
And since before the bleeding in the brain приковало him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player, small categories, player of the highest basketball League, the Commissioner and the head of bsn with cowboys баямона and President of basketball Federation.
"I have done a lot of roles in basketball throughout his life, including several at the same time, as when I was President bsn, Director General of the national team and president of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls primera hora Reyes during a visit to his home in bayamón, Puerto Rico, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate, making this statement.
Walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things, gathered for a long way, it is about it.
Bayamón, Puerto Rico in heart
With the greatest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the cowboys, since the 1950s as a player until 1982, when 15 years old his performances in the role of со-агента or an agent of the contract.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships cowboys since 1967, as an agent, со-агента or supervisor.
There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year debut джерома минси in bsn.
Since then, and continue to lead became "cuco" ortiz, who was a great administrator, "Reyes said.
I remember that gene bar-tov, who was heading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you is a very strong player, rising 6 '7."
"Do you want?"
And that was the beginning of минси, one of the best players, who were in Puerto Rico.
Bar-tov then recommended снайпера Raymond Carl Friedrich gauss, which received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.
I remember that said that if минси brought the championship баямону gauss would help win over another.
чемпионством cowboys with гауссом I enjoyed, but already at a distance, because to 1988 was the head of the Federation.
By the time I chose to enjoy his achievements and contributions минси in the national team.
I remember, as we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, at which we got fourth place and it was to be the Bronze, if not the Canadian judge who made us beat the final game, Reyes said.
The team with the 1990 World Cup - it is the best team, what you have ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one with the Pan American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and smashed the United States National team, which was quite similar to the one that we have won bronze at the World championships.
In the team not only again played минси, Carl Friedrich gauss, Ramona риваса фико Lopez and 'пикулина' (ортиса), but also young (Javier) 'тоньито' colón and James Carter, brothers Francisco Leon (and Edgar) and Mario 'кихоте' Morales, who did not participate in the 90 year due to knee injuries.
The team, which was, perhaps, not the best in terms of personnel, but it has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 неукене, Argentina.
With ролевыми players like 'канито' ньевеса, Pablo алисеа and young rolando хурруитнера players in return, temporarily отстраненных for turmoil in панамериканском Mar del Plata, we won the gold Cup against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, this was пикулин ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as it did пикулин.
And that's without taking into account his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best пуэрториканцем leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young men, including Julio toro, flora мелендеса, Carlos Morales, Raymond далмау армандито either Torres.
Of the young, I really enjoy the work Leo ариллы.
What would you consider your greatest achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the early 1990s in bsn was up to 17 teams in the season.
What you have to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it is too.
At least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification course and for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy their grandchildren and occasionally go on basketball games.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, иcабель, which has always been with me.

In 1995 he had discovered a malignant tumor in the liver and he suffered transplantation.
Long before "Dallas," hagman had gained fame on television thanks to the role of порядочного type in a light comedy "I dream of jeannie," транслировавшейся NBC from 1965 to 1970.

The course, which explores "the end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when religion Professor Stuart Sharm decided to read about the end of the world, he knew that had the irresistible lure: the end of the course "of the long countdown" of the Mayan calendar On December 21, for which ухватились many people as a proof that heralded the end of the world.
But charm, had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic hurricane sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "долгоармагеддоном," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where Christian theorists believe that end of time will begin the Apocalypse.
"I did not realize that it will be the an apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharm this week university students рутгерс-камден (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we had only 30 days, it was really a good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he is not the only one professor, which offers courses on the theme "doomsday" in this semester, theoretically, the latter in history.
In темпльском university Associate Professor Barry вакер reads course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We are analyzing why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way that offer the hypothetical scenario that cause certain human actions.
If the nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, could erupt war.
This month, the students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples of real life.
"I tried to tell students about what is possible, perhaps, seductive and impossible," said вакер.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history Matthew ресталл and his colleague Amara solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, combined to read the course, which is simply called "the end of the world."
"We don't add '2012', to always be able to read the course again, if not the end of the world will come," said ресталл.
Despite the "inevitable" destruction, students must learn to cook projects and to take final exams.
At Penn state final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, that leaves students with no choice but to work "to the same night, in which presumably come the end of the world," said ресталл.
Courses were quite popular.
"The place out for two hours," said ресталл about its course for students with high average scores, which have registered 35 students.
We received an e-mail for many weeks before the start of the Semester from people who asked whether another place.
The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what makes people, to console themselves," said brigid Robinson, 23-летняя student of religion and sociology of хаддонфилда, New Jersey, in рутгерс-камден.
And an apocalyptic image of thoughts, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the lack of it.
Will Smith векеса, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he watched all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard of course, which would have learned this," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the Professor - not said, that believes in the doomsday date on 21 December.
"Our first project touched Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we his discredited," said Julie зеглен, 20-year-old student last course in темпльском University of уэст-честера.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is simply a key moment in the calendar, said ресталл.
But he noted that there are apocalyptic concerns in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicted the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mainly in англоговорящем world.
Joseph dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La salle county, Texas, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knows about a course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to the disposal of the higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
ресталл noticed that for a long time, talked about the many days of the last judgment, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21," people immediately begin to think about the next date "or философствовать that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some said they would go to parties "doomsday."
"Could be, would call someone from friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Faculty of communication.
